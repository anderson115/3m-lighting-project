    "full_text": " I have over 100 HomeKit devices in my house, and a lot of them are sensors. From contact sensors to tell if a door is open, a new vibration sensor I'm trying out on a washing machine, motion sensors to turn on lights in closets and patios, a new solar-powered pool sensor that's telling me the pH, chlorine, and other data, plus water leak sensors, outdoor weather temperature, and more. So in this video, I'm going to tell you 10 of the automations I use around my house using all these sensors. And before we jump in, don't forget to subscribe to the channel before you go. So first up is an automation that runs every time I enter my office. I actually have a contact sensor down by the floor, and this reads whether or not the door is opened. The contact sensor I'm using there is actually the Aqara door and window sensor P2. It's a matter-over-thread sensor. It doesn't require the Aqara hub, and it's been super reliable because it uses thread. Now I have a bunch of automations programmed, and for this contact sensor, I'm going to go to my Home app and then over to the Automations tab. I'm going to be going over a bunch of these as we talk about the different sensors, but this P2 sensor is when the office door opens. And I have this automation run only during certain times of day, which is typically when I... enter my studio. Not only can you add a time for an automation, but you can also choose if you want this automation to run when you are home, when nobody is home, and all different combinations there. But when my door opens between 7 and 8.30 a.m., it's actually going to run my OfficeWorks Scene. It's helpful to create scenes for automations like this, because then if you add or remove devices to the scene, your automation is still going to work. And just to show you, I'll jump over to my studio room so you can see the scene. In my OfficeWorks Scene, you'll see it opens my blackout shades, turns on my ceiling fan, and the ceiling fan lights. Then I have a bunch of scenes for filming, which turns those off and turns on my filming lights. If you want to learn more about my studio automations, I'll put a video above and in the description. Next up is actually a new vibration sensor I'm trying from Aqara. This thing can detect when vibration starts and stops. I have an older washing machine and dryer, so I don't get notifications on my phone when it stops. So I put the vibration sensor on the side of the washing machine, because it doesn't make any sound. And one of the triggers you can use for a HomeKit sensor is when it detects something or when it stops detecting something. So for this vibration sensor, I chose when it stops detecting motion, which means the washing machine has stopped running. It's stopped shaking. Again, you can specify the time or people, but I want this to run whenever, because I want to know when the washing machine is done. Now, HomeKit doesn't have great built-in notifications for when sensors start or stop certain things, but you can create a shortcut based on this HomeKit automation. And then I actually use an app called PushCut to send me that notification when the washing machine stops. PushCut is a great app for customizing some notifications like this. I actually have a few of them. I have one on a mini fridge when the door is left open. So if you want to learn more about setting a PushCut with HomeKit notifications, I also have a video on that linked above and down below. Number three, I have a bunch of motion sensors around the house. This is the Philips Hue motion sensor. I have this in our pantry. Then I have other motion sensors like the Eve and others in different closets. One of the simple automations I have for this specific Philips Hue motion sensor is in the pantry. When motion is detected in that pantry, it turns the pantry light on. Super simple. I do a motion sensor rather than a contact sensor, which you could do a contact sensor. I don't know if you've seen that before. I don't know if you've seen that before. I don't know if you've seen that before. I don't know if you've seen that before. And if you walk into the pantry and the door was open just a crack, well, then that contact sensor automation is not going to run. So I find a motion sensor automation like this, especially when going into a closet that usually gets left open, is really reliable. One of my favorite sensors is this Aqara contact sensor. It's really inexpensive, super small and discreet. It does require an Aqara hub. I'll put links to one of those in the description, but you can get a three pack of these contact sensors for $42 on Amazon. It's a pretty great deal. One place where I have these contact, sensors is the door going from our master bedroom to the patio, because I want to know if that ever gets left open. Now this automation, I actually have set up in the Aqara app because it has built in when doors are left open for a certain amount of time, just built right into the app. So here for this automation, you see the bedroom patio door contact sensor if it's opened, and then you can easily set for over three minutes. So if the door opens and it's left open for three minutes or more, then the Aqara app is going to send me a notification. If you're looking for using contact sensors to know when a door is open or not, setting those automations, directly in the Aqara app is one of the easiest ways to do it. But if you just want to use the Apple home app and no third party apps, another way to do it is how I'm using an Aqara contact sensor on the mini fridge out on the patio. If the mini fridge ever gets left open, that's not a good situation. So I have another automation here that's when backyard mini fridge opens. So the contact sensor will trigger this automation whenever it detects the door is open. And I have another shortcut here, but this time I actually have it wait 60 seconds as the first action, because I want to know if the door was left open, not just every time it opens. So with that wait 60 seconds command, then I add an if statement. If the mini fridge contact sensor is still open after those 60 seconds, then I have a push cuts notification. It'll trigger the notification to send to my phone and I'll know that the mini fridge has been left open. So if you want to do everything just in the home app, push cuts again is a great way to do that. While we're out here on the patio, I've been trying to make my pool a little smarter, not only with robots, but Cactury at least sent me this seven in one pool sensor. It does have a micro USB port to charge it, but it also has a solar panel on top. And it's capable of doing that. So I'm going to go ahead and do that. So I'm going to go ahead and do that. It's kept itself charged every day. I never have to worry about charging it again. After I spent some time calibrating it for chlorine and pH, I can now jump into the app for the pool sensor. It does require a small hub that you have to have connected nearby, but now I can get all this data on my pool at a glance. I can see the temperature of the water, the pH, the salt levels and a bunch of other data for this seven in one sensor. I did test these numbers against actually taking a sample down to pinch a penny and seeing what they said. And I find the numbers that the seven in one sensor provides is very accurate. You can go in and see historical data for pH and other levels. We actually have a saltwater pool, so you can see that information here as well. And overall, it's just been nice to check these numbers whenever I want without having to get a bunch of chemicals out, water samples and all that stuff. Also out here on the patio, I have multiple sensors like this Eve weather, which will tell me the temperature outside and combine that with the Eve motion sensor. I can now run automations based on motion and temperature outside. For instance, if I walk outside and it's hot, I want the patio fans to turn on. Now, this particular automation, is difficult to build in the actual home app. So actually in the Eve app, I've built this automation and then it transfers over. So if I go to the automations tab here in the Eve app, you can then go over to rules. That's what the Eve app calls automations. And one of the ones I created was patio fans if hot. What this does is I can choose a trigger and then a condition whether or not I want action to be taken. So the trigger here is the motion. This Eve motion sensor that's typically outside will detect motion. And as soon as it does, it's going to run this, but it's going to do a conditional. Now I stated if the temperature outside is above 77 degrees, which Florida summertime, it pretty much is most days, then it's actually going to turn on my patio fans. But if the temperature is below 77 degrees, it will do nothing. And even though I created it here in the Eve app, it actually shows up here in the home app automation as well. Basically what the Eve app has to do is create a scene based on those conditionals. But it's right here. I can enable it or disable it here in the home app and even select more accessories if I wanted to. Number eight, I have water leak sensors all over the house. These are car water leak sensors do require an Acara hub. You can get an E1 and a water leak sensor for $43 for both of those. And these I place under pretty much every sink in the house. I have had times where water leak was detected once was actually a problem with a pipe. And so thankfully got that fixed. Sometimes it was just a drippy pipe underneath the sink. And this will give you a warning on your phone. It's a critical alert in home kit, and then you can take care of the water leak. So love these things. I put them everywhere. You can see it show up here in the home app as a leak sensor, expand it. And it basically says a simple leak detected. Yes or no. You do get the battery level here. And I found that these batteries last almost forever. I don't know if I've ever changed a battery in one of these Acara water leak sensors. Number nine, I have another contact sensor. This is in my kid's bathroom. They have a tendency to leave the bathroom lights on even when they leave and are not in there. So I put a contact sensor at the bottom of the door. And then I had this automation. When the kids bathroom, door opens, this is another Acara P2 contact sensor. And I do have it wait a few seconds because if they open the door and they're just trying to get out, I don't want to show the lights off on them that fast. So I have it wait 15 seconds and then it turns off the lights in the bathroom. And if they go into the bathroom, turn on the lights, believe the door open. This won't run. This only runs if they had the door closed and then are leaving the bathroom and it will shut the lights off. So they're not left on all day. You can also combine that with a motion detector for when motion stops being detected. But I would recommend doing conditionals. Oftentimes, if you're very still in a room, motion sensors will say no motion detected and just shut the lights off on you. Now you might have heard of the Acara present sensor and I actually have one, but have not gotten it to work super well. So I typically don't use it in automations waiting for an updated version or some firmware updates to integrate it more. On a number 10, if you have a garage, I highly recommend getting a garage camera. I actually have an Acara G2H camera just sitting in the garage. It's a great way to tell if the garage is open or closed. Right now it's dark, so I know it's closed. But the great part about HomeKit Q7 is that it's not a camera. It's a camera. It's a camera. It's a camera. And the reason I like these cameras, especially HomeKit Secure Video, is each camera actually acts as a motion sensor as well. So this garage cam, which is the Acara G2H, actually has a motion sensor that you can then automate. So when motion is detected in the garage, or you can program any of your cameras for when motion is detected, you can then build automations off that. I also like having a camera in the garage because then I can have a quick glance as whether or not the door is actually open or closed. I do use the Maris sensor and garage door opener, and it's pretty accurate telling me whether or not it's closed. But I have had some experience with it. I've had some false positives where you have to kind of open and close it again to reset it. So I just like having the camera there for peace of mind. So those are 10 of my favorite automations for HomeKit sensors. But I want to give you one bonus shortcut, which when you have these sensors, pretty cool you can do. If I go to the shortcuts app, I'm going to search for home and I have this home status shortcut. If I expand, you can see what this does. It's actually getting the current state of different contact sensors like the garage. I have a contact sensor on my utility room door, the patio, and you can add as many as you would like. Then I have a little text block. Here that basically tells me the status of each door or lock and shows that to me in quick look. So when I run this shortcut, I'll actually be able to know is the garage closed or open. I can see right there, utility door closed patio door locked, and that's actually the Yale smart lock giving me that status. But you can also add a contact sensor. Then you can customize this for all of your contact sensors, even motion sensors. And it's a great way to create just kind of a current home status. If you want to learn more about building that shortcut or more shortcuts, let me know down in the comments. I actually just published a shortcuts request video. You can check it out right up here and have an entire playlist of just requests from you where I built those shortcuts. I'll link that video down below. And if you want a complete tour of my 2024 smart home with over a hundred HomeKit devices, I put my full tour video right up here.

Visible lighting challenges:\n   - The lighting in the image appears to be low, with shadows visible on the person's hand and arm, which indicates that the source of light is not strong enough or positioned correctly to avoid creating harsh shadows.\n   - There seems to be a lack of balanced illumination, as the area being pointed at is well-lit while the rest of the image is darker.\n\n2. Demonstrated lighting solutions or techniques:\n   - The person is pointing to the screen of a smartphone, which could suggest they are discussing the use of light management in their device. This might imply an app or feature that adjusts the display's brightness to improve viewing conditions.\n\n3. Mentioned or shown lighting product:\n   - There is a small white remote control next to the phone, indicating that it may be controlling some aspect of the lighting in the room or on the smartphone screen. This could imply a wireless light control system for adjusting brightness levels and other lighting parameters.\n\n4. Context (room type, task, mood):\n   - The image appears to show an indoor setting, possibly a home office or workspace, where someone is giving advice or guidance related to smartphone features or products.\n   - The person's hand gesture, along with the focus on the smartphone, suggests they are in the midst of explaining or demonstrating something about the phone's lighting capabilities or an accompanying product.\n   - The overall mood seems to be educational or instructional, as they are highlighting a specific aspect of the device or product being used."

        "analysis": "The image shows a man in front of a microphone, seemingly in a studio setting for a video recording. He appears to be engaged in a conversation or presentation, with his hands outstretched as if he is explaining something or gesturing for emphasis. Here's an analysis based on the visible lighting:\n\n1. Lighting Problems/Challenges:\n   - The lighting in the room seems to be relatively flat, without strong shadows or highlights that can indicate a lack of directional light or uneven distribution of artificial light sources.\n   - The man's face and upper torso are the most illuminated areas, while his legs are somewhat darker than the rest of him. This could indicate an imbalance in the lighting setup.\n\n2. Lighting Solutions/Techniques:\n   - Based on what I can see, it seems that there may be a softbox or diffuse light source to the left side of the frame, as the light appears soft and evenly distributed on his face.\n   - The use of artificial lighting is necessary here, given that the man is indoors in a room with no natural light visible from this perspective.\n\n3. Specific Lighting Products:\n   - As a text-based AI, I can't determine if there are specific products being used or mentioned without additional context. However, it appears to be a professional lighting setup suitable for video recording and broadcast.\n\n4. Lighting Context (Room Type, Task, Mood):\n   - The room type is consistent with a studio setting, designed for video production, which typically requires controlled lighting to ensure even illumination on the subject's face.\n   - The task at hand appears to be a discussion or presentation, as indicated by the man's gestures and body language.\n   - The mood of the image is neutral and professional, suggesting that this could be part of a corporate video or educational content where precise lighting is important for clarity and visual appeal."

The lighting seems to be coming mainly from artificial sources, such as the flashlight app on the phone or possibly a flashlight itself.\n\n2. The phone displaying the flashlight app suggests that the person might be using the flashlight feature of their phone to illuminate the area, which could be seen as a temporary lighting solution for the dark environment. \n\n3. There are no specific lighting products mentioned or shown in this frame, but the use of the phone flashlight indicates an improvised solution rather than a specialized one.\n\n4. The context of this image is that of a room with low light levels, likely an office, bedroom, or storage area where someone is trying to access or photograph items, possibly for a video tutorial or inventory purposes."

This can be inferred from the overall dimness of the environment, which is not ideal for photography or video recording as it may result in a lack of detail and potential overexposure due to camera flash.\n\n2. Lighting Solutions: The image features an individual adjusting the lighting conditions on a smartphone using an app. This could indicate that the person is utilizing artificial lighting, perhaps from a nearby lamp or light fixture, which isn't directly visible in the photo. Alternatively, they might be controlling smart LED lights to improve the lighting conditions.\n\n3. Specific Lighting Products: There are no specific lighting products mentioned or shown in this frame. However, we can infer that a smartphone is being used for adjusting the lighting settings, which suggests that the individual may be using an app designed for adjusting ambient, task, or mood lighting.\n\n4. Lighting Context: The scene appears to be set indoors, possibly in a living room or bedroom. The focus seems to be on improving the lighting conditions for taking photos or recording videos, which indicates that this might be a personal space where better lighting is sought for specific tasks such as content creation."

The person is wearing glasses and a blue shirt with a design element.\n\n1. Lighting Problems/Challenges:\n   - Uneven lighting: There seems to be a mix of brightly lit areas (possibly from the decorative background) and dimmer areas, which can create an unflattering look on the subject's face.\n   - Shadowing: The person is casting shadows onto their shirt, suggesting that the main light source may not be directly in front of them or might be too close to the subject.\n   - Color temperature inconsistency: The colors in the image seem a bit off, with the lighting from different sources creating an artificial look.\n\n2. Lighting Solutions/Techniques:\n   - Use of fill lights: The person's face appears well-lit, indicating the use of additional light sources (fill lights) to even out the lighting and prevent shadows from being cast on their body.\n   - Adjustable lighting: The subject is holding their hands out as if adjusting a light source or controlling the camera flash, which could be either an adjustable light fixture or a smartphone flash, demonstrating how to use manual control over artificial lighting to create a more flattering look.\n\n3. Lighting Products Mentioned/Shown:\n   - It is not possible to discern specific lighting products in this image without additional context or information about the equipment used.\n\n4. Lighting Context:\n   - The room has an industrial, modern aesthetic with geometric patterns and a wooden floor.\n   - The mood of the image suggests that it may be a professional setting, such as a video conference or interview, where the person is discussing or presenting something to an audience, given their attire and gestures."

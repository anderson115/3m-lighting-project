    "full_text": " How's it going guys? Welcome back to the Patriot DIY channel. In this video I'm going to be showing you how to add LED backlighting to your shelves. Alright guys, if you have a home bar or some shelves at home that you want to add some backlighting to, this is the video for you. Now I built these upper cabinets and shelves in a previous video. If you want to check that out, I'll put a link to that right here at the top of the screen. I love the way this looks and it fits perfectly here in my man cave, but today I want to add some backlighting to these shelves. This is going to be a pretty simple project that almost anybody can do, and I'm going to show you step by step how I'm going to do this. But first guys, if you haven't done it yet, make sure you hit that subscribe button down below, hit that notification bell, and give us a thumbs up. The main thing you're going to need for this project is going to be your LED strip lighting. Now you can use any LED strip lighting. You can use any LED strip lights that you want. This just happens to be the ones that I picked up. These are off Amazon, and I will have a link to these in the description below. Now I chose this one specifically for this project for a couple reasons. First, because of the shape of the strip itself. It gives me a nice wide surface here on the side to attach it to the back of my shelf, and it's going to direct all the light upwards, which is exactly what we want for the back of our shelves. Now one issue with a lot of LED strip lights is you don't get a constant stream of light. You're going to see a dot of light where every little LED is. And I chose these specifically because the LEDs are diffused and it gives you a nice constant stream of light. You can see here that you don't see each individual dot of the LEDs. You just get a long continuous light. Now I think these are going to be great for the back lighting on our shelves, but because this is so flexible, this could be used to create any type of design on your wall. You can spell out letters with it or anything you want to do. So I'm going to go ahead and do that. Now with that said, let's get everything taken down off of these shelves and get to work. Once I get everything taken down off of these shelves, I can remove them from the wall and get ready to install my lights. All right guys, so we have a few different options. We have a few different options. We have a few different options. We have a few different options. We have a few different options for how we can attach our LED lights to our shelves. The first option would be just to stick the LED strip to the back of the shelf like this using either double-sided tape or hot glue. And as long as you have a gap between your shelf and the wall, this would work out fine. Another option would be to use these little clips that came with the LEDs. You just screw these down to the board and then the LED fits right into that little clip. For my application. The way I would do that is I would attach the LED strip directly to the top of the shelf. Then I'd cut another narrow strip of wood and attach that in front of my LEDs. That way it hides them from view, but still allows the light to shine on the wall behind the shelf. The next option would be just to cut or route a channel directly into the top or bottom of the shelf, whichever direction you want your light. We'll cut that channel the same width as our LED strip, and then it'll just fit down into that groove. Like an inlay. It'll be perfectly hidden, but still shine up in the direction that we want it. I think that'll give us the cleanest possible look. And it's pretty simple to do as long as you have a table saw or a router that you can route that channel with. So I think that's what I'm going to do. Let me know what you guys think in the comment section below, which method would you use for attaching these to your shelves. First, I need to set the height of my table saw blade to just a little more than that. So I'm going to use a little bit of the same height as the table saw blade. First, I need to set the height of my table saw blade to just a little more than that. So I'm going to use a little bit of the same height as the table saw blade. So I'm going to use a little bit of the same height as the table saw blade. And then I'll run my shelf through the table saw cutting a groove all the way down. And then I'll run my shelf through the table saw cutting a groove all the way down. Now this groove is obviously not wide enough for the light to fit into yet. So I need to move my table saw fence over and then run the board back through widening that groove. I'm going to keep doing that a little bit at a time, test fitting the light as I go until I get a perfect fit. Now you are able to cut this light at designated spots along the strip, so I'm going to test fit this light and mark the length that I want. I'm going to cut this light at designated spots along the strip, so I'm going to test fit this light and mark the length that I want. I'm going to cut this light at designated spots along the strip, so I'm going to test fit this light and mark the length that I want. And then cut it down to size. And then cut it down to size. To attach this permanently, I'm going to run a bead of hot glue down that groove and then fit this light down into place. down into place. Then I'll press it down to make sure it sits just below the top surface of the shelf. You can see now that this gives us a nice clean professional look. The only thing left to do now is to reinstall our shelves on the wall and route our wires. On the bottom shelf I've cut a small notch onto the end of the board and I'm going to be running this wire up under my cabinet. Then on this middle shelf I've cut a notch into the back of the cabinet so I can route the wires behind it and then down to our outlet. All right guys so now we've got our LED strips inlaid into our shelf. We've got our shelves back installed and I routed the wires back behind my upper cabinets down and behind my refrigerator. Now these light kits do come with a little touch sensor switch that you can put in line with the lights. This is going to do a couple things for you. You can adjust the brightness level. You can also turn it on and off with this switch here. But what I decided to do instead was to plug it into one of these wireless remote control outlets. You just plug your lights into the receiver and then you can turn it on and off with this switch here. And then you have this handy dandy little wall switch that you can mount anywhere you want to. It works exactly like a remote so all you have to do is and there you go. Now this same switch controls my neon signs and my string lights that I have up along the ceiling so with just one click I can turn all that on at the same time. Now I love the way this looks guys. I love that light shining up. Now let's get the stuff back up on these shelves and take a look at the final product. Alright guys that's it for how to add backlighting to your shelves. I hope this video helped you out. If you guys have any other methods that you guys would use to do this make sure you let us know in the comment section below. I love how this turned out guys. I thought these shelves looked good already but this just added a whole nother level. I hope you guys enjoyed this video and I'll see you next time.",

Lighting Solutions/Techniques:\n   - The use of a track lighting system suggests that adjustable spotlights are being utilized to provide focused illumination where it's needed, such as on the wood surface for sanding or finishing.\n   - There is at least one additional source of light (to the left), which can be used to supplement the main track light and provide more even lighting across the table.\n\n3. Specific Lighting Products Mentioned/Shown:\n   - The image mentions \"track lights\" as a product being used for the task. However, there are no specific brands or models visible in the image.\n\n4. Lighting Context (Room Type, Task, Mood):\n   - Room Type: This appears to be a workshop or garage, given the presence of workbenches and woodworking tools.\n   - Task: The person is engaged in some form of surface preparation on wooden planks, such as sanding or applying finish.\n   - Mood: The mood is utilitarian and focused, emphasizing the task at hand rather than creating a warm or inviting atmosphere."

        "analysis": "1. The visible lighting problem in this frame is the lack of illumination in the room. There is no direct light source, which makes it difficult to see details and may indicate a need for better task lighting or ambient light distribution.\n2. The image suggests that there might be a window or other source of natural light outside the frame, but it does not seem to be directly entering this space, as indicated by shadows on the floor. If this is a typical room usage scenario, such as an attic or storage room, additional artificial lighting solutions may be required for better visibility and functionality.\n3. The lighting solution in this context could involve the following techniques:\n   - Adding overhead track lighting to the ceiling.\n   - Installing recessed lighting within the structure of the room, possibly along the walls or inside cabinets if they exist.\n   - Using portable task lights when needed for specific tasks.\n4. The lighting context appears to be a storage area or a workspace that requires better visibility, likely for organizing items or carrying out certain activities. Improving lighting would enhance the efficiency and safety of this space."

        "analysis": "1. In this video frame, the lighting is unevenly distributed with one side of the room being darker than the other. The right side appears to have less illumination than the left, which creates an imbalance in the overall light distribution.\n\n2. To demonstrate a lighting solution, the person in the image seems to be showing off a flashlight or a light source that is much brighter than the room's general ambient lighting. This could suggest that they are discussing or demonstrating how to use a portable light for better visibility, possibly in a dimly lit environment like a storage area.\n\n3. There are no specific products visible in this frame, but the person appears to be using a flashlight or a similar handheld light source.\n\n4. The lighting context of this image includes a person standing in front of shelves with various items and kitchen appliances. The task seems to be related to searching for something stored in these cabinets. The mood is somewhat informal, as the individual appears relaxed while holding up or pointing towards the light source."

        "analysis": "1. Visible lighting problems: The primary lighting issue in this image appears to be that the main light source, which seems to be an overhead pendant light, is not directly illuminating the person being interviewed or the task at hand. The light casts shadows on the individual and the table, indicating that the light's angle does not provide optimal illumination for the interview setting.\n2. Demonstrated lighting solutions: Although there are no explicit mentions of specific lighting products, it seems that the person being interviewed is using a light source (possibly a penlight) to enhance their visibility and draw attention to what they are holding, which could be interpreted as a makeshift or improvised lighting solution for their immediate task.\n3. No specific lighting product is visible or mentioned in this frame. However, the person seems to be using an unconventional light source to improve the current lighting conditions.\n4. The lighting context is that of an indoor setting where an interview is being conducted in a room with rustic wood and metal elements. It appears to be a casual, informal environment for what might be an impromptu video recording or podcasting session."

        "analysis": "In this image, we see a display case in a store or bar with various bottles of alcohol arranged behind glass. Here's an analysis of the lighting aspects:\n\n1. Lighting Problems or Challenges:\n   - The lighting appears to be uneven, with some areas brightly lit and others less so. This can create shadows on the bottles and make it difficult for customers to see the details of each bottle clearly.\n   - There is no direct light on the bottles at the very top of the shelf, which might not be as well-lit as the ones nearer lights.\n\n2. Lighting Solutions or Techniques:\n   - The use of overhead track lighting provides adjustable directional light, allowing for better control and targeting of specific areas such as the bottles on the top shelf.\n   - Lights mounted to the ceiling give diffuse lighting over a wider area, which could be more suitable for ambiance or general illumination.\n\n3. Specific Lighting Products Mentioned or Shown:\n   - Track lighting is visible, providing directional light that can be adjusted.\n\n4. Lighting Context (Room Type, Task, Mood):\n   - The room context suggests a retail environment where the task is to showcase and highlight various products for customers to view and purchase.\n   - The mood seems to be one of elegance and sophistication, given the well-presented display case and the array of alcoholic beverages on display.\n\nIn summary, the lighting challenges include uneven illumination and insufficient lighting at the very top shelf. The solutions demonstrated involve the use of adjustable track lighting to provide targeted and directed light where it's needed most for optimal product visibility."

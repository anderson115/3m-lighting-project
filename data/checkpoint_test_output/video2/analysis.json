    "full_text": " Hello and welcome to the MyClayCo studio. I am Tegan and today we are going to be talking about baking polymer clay. Now easily the most frequently asked questions that land in our inbox are all around baking and curing polymer clay so we wanted to do a whole video on it for you today. We are going to be sharing our top tips as well as the crucial things that you need to know and we're also going to be answering some of those frequently asked questions that we get. Before we get into our top tips one of the things that you should know about polymer clay is that it should be a bit bendy once it's baked properly. That's because unlike some other clays it does have plasticizers added to it so it means that once it is cured it does have that slight flex to it. So if you are baking your polymer clay and do find that it's a bit flexible afterwards congratulations you have cured your polymer clay correctly. If you're not finding this, if you're finding that your polymer clay is brittle once it's baked you can snap it in half or when you're drilling jump ring holes it's just crumbling around the hole then you definitely need to be careful. If you're finding that your polymer clay is brittle once it's baked you can watch this video. Let's get into those top tips. The first two tips that I'm going to give you are probably the most crucial things that you need to know when you're baking your polymer clay. So number one is the temperature. So temperature seems like an easy thing. The packet says bake at 130 degrees so you turn your oven to 130 degrees but it doesn't bake correctly. Now this is quite often because ovens are fickle things and although you've got the temperature set at 130 degrees it might not actually be baking at 130 degrees. So you need to be careful. If you're baking your polymer clay at 130 degrees you might find that it's baking at 110 degrees or it's baking at 150 degrees which quickly becomes a problem because you're going to find that your clay is either going to be over baked or under baked. So if your clay is under baked it can mean that your pieces will be brittle whereas if it's over baked you might find that your clay burns. So it's really crucial that you know what temperature your oven is baking at. Sit tight because I have another tip for you in a moment that will help with this issue. So that were two crucial things. The second crucial thing is the baking time. Now with polymer clay quite often the baking time is around 30 minutes depending on the thickness of your pieces. It is important that you bake it for this minimum baking time. So if you're going to be baking it for 10 or 15 minutes you probably will find that it's under baked. Now something that is interesting about polymer clay is that you can't really over bake it so long as the temperature of your oven is correct. So for example if you were to leave your clay pieces in the oven for 40 minutes or 50 minutes or an hour you will likely find that they come out just as they would if you baked them for the 30 minutes. And this is one of the fabulous things about polymer clay because it means that you can bake it, add details to it, bake it again, add more details and even bake it a third time. It's become a bit of a joke in the studio that I quite often forget about my pieces and I don't set an alarm and they're in there for an hour or so. It's true she leaves them in there all the time like sometimes but over an hour I have to take them out all the time. So if you do leave them in there for longer than that minimum baking time don't stress they will likely be fine. So the crucial thing to know is that you need to have them in there for that minimum baking time but if you do leave them in there a little bit longer it's not going to cause any harm. Now I said I would have a tip for you around the baking temperature and that is to use an oven thermometer. Now oven thermometers are quite inexpensive you can normally pick them up for 10 or 15 dollars from a hardware store or Kmart or Target and that will mean that you're baking at an accurate temperature. So even if your oven dial is saying that it's baking at 130 and your oven's at 150 you'll know. Our next tip is to follow the manufacturer's instructions. You might find that different brands of clay have different recommended baking temperatures or different recommended baking times so it's really important that you read what it says on the packet to ensure that you don't underbake or overbake your oven. Make sure that you preheat your oven just as you would if you were baking cookies or something. If you don't preheat your oven you run that risk that your pieces are not going to be baking at the correct temperature for the right amount of time and they'll end up underbaked. Our final tip is to test. So before you get started you want to make sure that you can find your oven's optimal baking time and temperature. You might find that your oven dial should be set at 150 degrees whereas somebody else might find that theirs should be set at 110. If you're using a different oven you might want to make sure that you're baking at the right temperature. If you're using a different oven you might want to make sure that you're baking at the right temperature. If you're using a different oven you might want to make sure that you're baking at the right temperature. If you're using a different oven you really depends on the oven that you're using. So if you're just starting out you've got a new oven we recommend doing some white tester pieces. Now the reason why we say white is because it will be easy to tell if your oven temperature is too hot because you'll be able to see that they're slightly burnt whereas if you do your tester pieces in a darker color you may not notice this. So get your tester pieces pop them in the oven and from there you can adjust the temperature higher or lower depending on what you find it needs. Now I promised at the start that I would be using a different oven but that we would go through a few of the frequently asked questions that we get so here they are. Why is my polymer clay bendy? We've already touched on this polymer clay does have plasticizers in it so unlike some other clays it will be bendy if it is cured correctly. Why is my clay brittle once it's baked? So there generally are two reasons for this. So one of them is going to be all of the baking temperature and time stuff that we've discussed today. The other reason it could be is the type of clay that you're using. A common thing that we see for beginners is that they start making jewelry with Sculpey 3. Now Sculpey 3 is an excellent modeling clay but it isn't so good for making earrings and you will probably find that if you do make earrings out of Sculpey 3 that it will be brittle once it's baked. So if you are looking to use Sculpey clay we recommend using Sculpey Primo or Sculpey Souffle. There are a range of other clays out there on the market like the Cernut range, Fimo Professional that are also excellent for making jewelry. So if you're looking to make jewelry and you're looking to make a sculpture you can definitely use Sculpey Primo or Sculpey Souffle. There are a range of other clays out there on the market like the Cernut range, Fimo Professional that are also excellent for making jewelry with. So just do your research before you try out a new clay. Can I increase the temperature that I'm baking at to make my pieces bake quicker? No, your pieces will burn. Do I need to tent my pieces? Now for those that don't know what tenting is, basically it means just putting a piece of foil over your clay while it's baking so that the tops of them don't burn. Now we don't ever tent our pieces and we don't find that our pieces burn. So it might be that for those people that are tenting their clay pieces, it could be that the element in their oven is quite close to their clay pieces while they're baking. And this can be quite common in toast ovens. So I would just test to see if you need to tent your pieces. If you do find that you've got your clay baking at the correct temperature and it is still burning, then it is something that you can expect. So I would just explore and see if it works for you. What baking surface do I bake my pieces on? Now this is going to come down to personal preference as well. So we almost always bake our pieces on a gloss ceramic tile. We like working on gloss ceramic tiles and we can then just pop them in the oven afterwards. But there are a range of other things that you can bake on. Some of the common ones that we see are either baking paper or also just normal copy paper. So again, have a play around and find out what works for you. Do I need a special oven to bake polymer clay in? No, you don't need a special oven. It's not like some other ceramics where you need to put them in a kiln. You can bake polymer clay in your normal ordinary oven. Now, if you don't want to bake in your normal oven, that is totally fine. You can look at one of those mini toaster oven options. You will probably find though that they do seem to be a little bit more fickle with getting the right temperature. So you will probably have to do just a little bit more testing to make sure that you get your baking. Temperature correct. Can I bake in an air fryer? So we actually tested this and found that we could cure our clay correctly in an air fryer. So it probably wouldn't be my first option because if your clay pieces aren't stuck down to your tile, they will whiz around in there and probably destroy them. But I guess it is an option is probably just not the best option. Can I bake my pieces in the same oven that I cook food in? Well, polymer clay isn't food safe. It is non-toxic. So yes, you can bake your pieces in your normal oven. It is recommended though, don't bake food and clay in there at the same time. And if you are to burn your clay in the oven, I would definitely recommend giving your oven a proper clean before using it again for food.

Lighting solutions: The image shows a setup that uses a combination of natural light coming through windows, along with artificial light sources such as lamps or overhead lighting fixtures. It seems there is an effort to evenly distribute the light by positioning the items to maximize visibility and minimize harsh shadows.\n\n3. Specific lighting products: The image does not explicitly show any specific lighting products or techniques. However, it's clear that the person arranging the items has considered the placement of items near windows or under artificial lights to create a balanced light environment.\n\n4. Lighting context: The setting appears to be an indoor space used for crafting or decoration preparation. The presence of colorful objects and the effort to present them well suggests that this scene is focused on creating an inviting atmosphere, possibly for an event or display.

However, it appears that the subject might be referring to the use of a flashlight or a small desk lamp to create selective focus.\n4. The room has a storefront vibe with shelves displaying crafts and materials, suggesting a creative or artistic space where lighting is important for highlighting the products and creating an inviting atmosphere.

The person holding the object is casting a harsh shadow, indicating that there's a light source from one side. The presence of the blue box on the other side of the object suggests that it might be used to diffuse or redirect light to fill in the shadows created by the main light source.\n3. No specific lighting products are mentioned or shown in this image. However, the use of a fill flash could imply the person is making adjustments using the camera's built-in flash feature.\n4. The context seems to be a casual, indoor environment, likely a room where someone is showcasing or demonstrating a product. The task involves presenting an item with a focus on the box and its contents, which may include a hygiene product such as cleaning wipes. The mood appears to be informative and practical, aimed at highlighting the use of the product for viewers' attention."

Additionally, there are no other significant sources of natural or artificial light that can be seen, which could result in dimly lit conditions or unflattering light on the subject's face.\n\n2. Lighting solutions or techniques demonstrated: The person is demonstrating a technique for lighting their face evenly by holding up a small black screen or object in front of them. This diffuses and reflects light onto the face, softening shadows and providing more even illumination.\n\n3. Specific lighting products mentioned or shown: While the person does not specifically mention a product, they are using a simple DIY solution\u2014a piece of cloth or fabric\u2014to achieve their desired lighting effect.\n\n4. Lighting context (room type, task, mood): The room appears to be an office or studio space with white walls and what seems to be retail shelves with items on them. Given the activity shown in the image (the person is holding a piece of material), it can be inferred that this might be a creative workspace where lighting is important for tasks such as photography, videography, or crafts. The mood conveyed by the image suggests creativity and resourcefulness, highlighting how simple solutions can sometimes provide professional-quality results in less than ideal lighting conditions."

This light source is aimed directly at the inside of the oven, illuminating it more evenly.\n\n3. There are no specific lighting products mentioned or shown in this image frame. However, the adjustable overhead light being used indicates that a flexible and focused light source can solve uneven illumination issues.\n\n4. The context here is an interior view of an oven with its door open, which suggests a functional cooking environment.

The lighting solutions or techniques being demonstrated seem to involve ambient lighting that provides a gentle and even glow throughout the scene without casting harsh shadows. The presence of a white wall and a light-colored countertop suggests that the aim is for the objects to be well-lit but not overly so as to maintain a warm, inviting atmosphere.\n3. There are no specific lighting products mentioned or shown in this image; it's more about the overall lighting design rather than individual fixtures or accessories.\n4.

The lighting context seems to be focused on the presentation of artwork or merchandise for sale.\n\n1. Visible Lighting Problems: The room is dimly lit, which can make it difficult for customers to see and appreciate the artwork. This low light level could impact sales as potential customers may not clearly see the details of the items they are considering for purchase.\n\n2. Demonstrated Lighting Solutions or Techniques: It seems like the person in the image is using a handheld spotlight to highlight an item or artwork on display. They appear to be gesturing towards something on one of the shelves, perhaps explaining its features or importance. This technique is commonly used in galleries and stores to draw attention to specific items.\n\n3. Specific Lighting Products: It's not clear if any specific lighting products are visible in the image. However, it seems that the spotlight being used by the person is a handheld device, which could be an adjustable flashlight or a small floodlight. These devices allow for directed light, which is useful in situations where selective highlighting is desired.\n\n4. Lighting Context: The room's purpose appears to be showcasing and selling artwork or similar products. The low overall lighting level might suggest that the ambient lighting is intended to create a cozy or atmospheric mood for visitors, while the spotlight is used to provide more focused illumination when needed. This would align with a strategy of highlighting key items without disrupting the general ambiance of the space."

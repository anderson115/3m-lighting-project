    "full_text": " How's it going guys? Welcome back to the Patriot DIY channel. In this video I'm going to be showing you how to add LED backlighting to your shelves. Alright guys, if you have a home bar or some shelves at home that you want to add some backlighting to, this is the video for you. Now I built these upper cabinets and shelves in a previous video. If you want to check that out, I'll put a link to that right here at the top of the screen. I love the way this looks and it fits perfectly here in my man cave, but today I want to add some backlighting to these shelves. This is going to be a pretty simple project that almost anybody can do, and I'm going to show you step by step how I'm going to do this. But first guys, if you haven't done it yet, make sure you hit that subscribe button down below, hit that notification bell, and give us a thumbs up. The main thing you're going to need for this project is going to be your LED strip lighting. Now you can use any LED strip lighting. You can use any LED strip lights that you want. This just happens to be the ones that I picked up. These are off Amazon, and I will have a link to these in the description below. Now I chose this one specifically for this project for a couple reasons. First, because of the shape of the strip itself. It gives me a nice wide surface here on the side to attach it to the back of my shelf, and it's going to direct all the light upwards, which is exactly what we want for the back of our shelves. Now one issue with a lot of LED strip lights is you don't get a constant stream of light. You're going to see a dot of light where every little LED is. And I chose these specifically because the LEDs are diffused and it gives you a nice constant stream of light. You can see here that you don't see each individual dot of the LEDs. You just get a long continuous light. Now I think these are going to be great for the back lighting on our shelves, but because this is so flexible, this could be used to create any type of design on your wall. You can spell out letters with it or anything you want to do. So I'm going to go ahead and do that. Now with that said, let's get everything taken down off of these shelves and get to work. Once I get everything taken down off of these shelves, I can remove them from the wall and get ready to install my lights. All right guys, so we have a few different options. We have a few different options. We have a few different options. We have a few different options. We have a few different options for how we can attach our LED lights to our shelves. The first option would be just to stick the LED strip to the back of the shelf like this using either double-sided tape or hot glue. And as long as you have a gap between your shelf and the wall, this would work out fine. Another option would be to use these little clips that came with the LEDs. You just screw these down to the board and then the LED fits right into that little clip. For my application. The way I would do that is I would attach the LED strip directly to the top of the shelf. Then I'd cut another narrow strip of wood and attach that in front of my LEDs. That way it hides them from view, but still allows the light to shine on the wall behind the shelf. The next option would be just to cut or route a channel directly into the top or bottom of the shelf, whichever direction you want your light. We'll cut that channel the same width as our LED strip, and then it'll just fit down into that groove. Like an inlay. It'll be perfectly hidden, but still shine up in the direction that we want it. I think that'll give us the cleanest possible look, and it's pretty simple to do as long as you have a table saw or a router that you can route that channel with. So I think that's what I'm going to do. Let me know what you guys think in the comment section below. Which method would you use for attaching these to your shelves? First, I need to set the height of my table saw blade to just a little more than a half inch. I'll cut the table saw blade to a little more than the height of the LED strip. And then I'll run my shelf through the table saw cutting a groove all the way down. Now this groove is obviously not wide enough for the light to fit into yet, so I need to move my table saw fence over and then run the board back through, widening that groove. I'm going to keep doing that a little bit at a time, test fitting the light as I go until I get a perfect fit. Now you are able to cut this light at designated spots along the strip, so I'm going to test fit this light and mark the length that I want. I'm going to cut this light at designated spots along the strip, so I'm going to test fit this light and mark the length that I want. I'm going to cut it down to different places. I'll cut this down and right here at the bottom of the strip. So that you can see that we have the same amount of height as the shaft. And that way is another way that you can cut it to theramble place of your give so at that height we are gonna move the n\u00e0y cures to hometown. We can use a\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 demonstrate video. Hit the like button and drop a the subscribe button if you'm not a solution to this. I will see you next time for a some sort of ennui that I need and then cut it down to size. To attach this permanently I'm going to run a bit of hot glue down that groove and then fit this light down into place. down into place. Then I'll press it down to make sure it sits just below the top surface of the shelf. You can see now that this gives us a nice clean professional look. The only thing left to do now is to reinstall our shelves on the wall and route our wires. On the bottom shelf I've cut a small notch onto the end of the board and I'm going to be running this wire up under my cabinet. Then on this middle shelf I've cut a notch into the back of the cabinet so I can route the wires behind it and then down to our outlet. Alright guys, so now we've got our LED strips inlaid into our shelf. We've got our shelves back installed and I routed the wires back behind my upper cabinets down and behind my refrigerator. These light kits do come with a little touch sensor switch that you can put inline with the lights. This is going to do a couple things for you. You can adjust the brightness level. You can also turn it on and off with this switch here. What I decided to do instead was to plug it into one of these wireless remote control outlets. You just plug your lights into the receiver and then you can turn it on and off. This is what it does. You can turn it on and off. You can turn it on and off. You can turn it on and off. You can turn it on and off. You can turn it on and off. You can turn it on and off. You can turn it on and off. You can turn it on and off. You can turn it on and off. You can turn it on and off. You can turn it on and off. You can make it turn on and off. You can do that with this little wheel when you're working. And then you have this handy-dandy little wall switch that you can mount anywhere you want to. It works exactly like a remote so all you have to do is. And there you go. Now this same switch controls my neon signs and my string lights that I have up along the ceiling. So with just one click, I can turn all that on at the same time. Now I love the way this looks, guys. I love that light shining up. Now, let's get the stuff back up on these shelves and take a look at this LED strip. at the final product. All right, guys, that's it for how to add backlighting to your shelves. I hope this video helped you out. If you guys have any other methods that you guys would use to do this, make sure you let us know in the comment section below. I love how this turned out, guys. I thought these shelves looked good already, but this just added a whole nother level. Now, don't forget, guys, I will have links to all the products we used in the description below if you want to do a project like this for yourself. So thanks for watching, guys. Please like, share, and subscribe, and we'll see you next time.",

The room appears to be dimly lit, which may present some challenges:\n\n1. **Lighting Problems**: The primary issue is insufficient lighting in the space, which can make it difficult for the person to see clearly and work efficiently. This might lead to errors or discomfort while working on the shelves.\n\n2. **Solutions**: To address this problem, one could consider adding more light sources to brighten up the area. The person is already using a flashlight or headlamp, which suggests they are addressing the issue in real-time by manually increasing illumination. This technique is effective but not practical for long periods of work without a proper lighting setup.\n\n3. **Specific Lighting Products**: The image does not explicitly show any specific lighting products. However, it's possible that the individual could benefit from additional LED strip lights, track lighting, or even recessed ceiling lights, depending on their preferences and needs for the workspace.\n\n4. **Context**: The context of this image is a workspace where tasks such as woodworking, assembly, or organizing items would be performed. Proper lighting in such an environment would not only improve visibility but also reduce strain on the eyes and potentially prevent accidents caused by low light conditions.\n\nIn summary, there are challenges related to insufficient lighting, with the individual resorting to a headlamp as a temporary solution. To create a more suitable working environment, adding additional light sources or upgrading existing ones would be beneficial."

Lighting solutions or techniques demonstrated:\n   - Using a flashlight or a bright light source to highlight specific areas of interest (such as nails, screws, or the edge of a plank). This technique allows for more precise work and can help spot issues or mistakes more easily.\n\n3. Specific lighting products mentioned or shown:\n   - While there isn't a clear view of a product in this frame, it seems that someone is using their personal flashlight to provide additional light where needed. This is an improvised solution rather than a professional lighting tool.\n\n4. Lighting context (room type, task, mood):\n   - The image suggests a workshop or home improvement setting, where the person may be working on a DIY project like repairing a wooden table or constructing a piece of furniture. The low lighting conditions can make such tasks more challenging and time-consuming due to reduced visibility. This could potentially lead to errors or damage to the wood.\n\nThe image highlights the importance of adequate lighting in workspaces, especially when working with fine details or materials that require precision. In this case, a more professional or brightly designed flashlight or task light would have been helpful to ensure optimal visibility and prevent any accidents or mistakes while working on the wooden surface."

Here's an analysis based on the lighting aspects:\n\n1. Lighting Problems/Challenges:\n   - There seems to be a focus issue, as the person is not clearly visible, suggesting that either the ambient light is too bright or there may be insufficient task lighting aimed directly at the subject.\n   - The room appears to have a single light source on the ceiling, which might provide inadequate localized illumination for detailed work with cables and connectors.\n\n2. Lighting Solutions/Techniques:\n   - To address the focus issue, additional task lighting could be used to brighten up the area around the person's hands and face, reducing the reliance on ambient light and providing more control over the lighting conditions.\n   - If more localized illumination is needed, a desk lamp or a small LED panel light would provide better targeted lighting for precise work.\n\n3. Specific Lighting Products:\n   - The photo doesn't explicitly show any specific lighting products. However, based on the challenges mentioned, using task lamps (desk lamps) or additional small LED lights could help to improve the lighting conditions for this scenario.\n\n4. Lighting Context:\n   - Room Type: This appears to be an office or workshop setting with a simple workbench. The table is used for electronic work and cable management.\n   - Task: Electronic setup, possibly involving wiring and connection of devices like modems or other network equipment.\n   - Mood: Focused and serious, given the concentration required for such tasks.\n\nTo improve the lighting conditions in this context, adding task lamps or LED panel lights to provide localized illumination where it's needed would help. Additionally, using diffusers on the existing light source could soften the ambient lighting and reduce glare, making the environment more comfortable for working with cables."

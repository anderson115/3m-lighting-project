    "full_text": " Hello and welcome to the MyClayCo studio. I am Tegan and today we are going to be talking about baking polymer clay. Now easily the most frequently asked questions that land in our inbox are all around baking and curing polymer clay so we wanted to do a whole video on it for you today. We are going to be sharing our top tips as well as the crucial things that you need to know and we're also going to be answering some of those frequently asked questions that we get. Before we get into our top tips one of the things that you should know about polymer clay is that it should be a bit bendy once it's baked properly. That's because unlike some other clays it does have plasticizers added to it so it means that once it is cured it does have that slight flex to it. So if you are baking your polymer clay and do find that it's a bit flexible afterwards congratulations you have cured your polymer clay correctly. If you're not finding this, if you're finding that your polymer clay is brittle once it's baked you can snap it in half or when you're drilling jump ring holes it's just crumbling around the hole then you definitely need to be careful. If you're finding that your polymer clay is brittle once it's baked you can watch this video. Let's get into those top tips. The first two tips that I'm going to give you are probably the most crucial things that you need to know when you're baking your polymer clay. So number one is the temperature. So temperature seems like an easy thing. The packet says bake at 130 degrees so you turn your oven to 130 degrees but it doesn't bake correctly. Now this is quite often because ovens are fickle things and although you've got the temperature set at 130 degrees it might not actually be baking at 130 degrees. So you need to be careful. If you're baking your polymer clay at 130 degrees you might find that it's baking at 110 degrees or it's baking at 150 degrees which quickly becomes a problem because you're going to find that your clay is either going to be over baked or under baked. So if your clay is under baked it can mean that your pieces will be brittle whereas if it's over baked you might find that your clay burns. So it's really crucial that you know what temperature your oven is baking at. Sit tight because I have another tip for you in a moment that will help with this issue. So that were two crucial things. The second crucial thing is the baking time. Now with polymer clay quite often the baking time is around 30 minutes depending on the thickness of your pieces. It is important that you bake it for this minimum baking time. So if you're going to be baking it for 10 or 15 minutes you probably will find that it's under baked. Now something that is interesting about polymer clay is that you can't really over bake it so long as the temperature of your oven is correct. So for example if you were to leave your clay pieces in the oven for 40 minutes or 50 minutes or an hour you will likely find that they come out just as they would if you baked them for the 30 minutes. And this is one of the fabulous things about polymer clay because it means that you can bake it, add details to it, bake it again, add more details and even bake it a third time. It's become a bit of a joke in the studio that I quite often forget about my pieces and I don't set an alarm and they're in there for an hour or so. It's true she leaves them in there all the time like sometimes but over an hour I have to take them out all the time. So if you do leave them in there for longer than that minimum baking time don't stress they will likely be fine. So the crucial thing to know is that you need to have them in there for that minimum baking time but if you do leave them in there a little bit longer it's not going to cause any harm. Now I said I would have a tip for you around the baking temperature and that is to use an oven thermometer. Now oven thermometers are quite inexpensive you can normally pick them up for 10 or 15 dollars from a hardware store or Kmart or Target and that will mean that you're baking at an accurate temperature. So even if your oven dial is saying that it's baking at 130 and your oven's at 150 you'll know. Our next tip is to follow the manufacturer's instructions. You might find that different brands of clay have different recommended baking temperatures or different recommended baking times so it's really important that you read what it says on the packet to ensure that you don't underbake or overbake your oven. Make sure that you preheat your oven just as you would if you were baking cookies or something. If you don't preheat your oven you run that risk that your pieces are not going to be baking at the correct temperature for the right amount of time and they'll end up underbaked. Our final tip is to test. So before you get started you want to make sure that you can find your oven's optimal baking time and temperature. You might find that your oven dial should be set at 150 degrees whereas somebody else might find that theirs should be set at 110. If you're using a different oven you might want to make sure that you're baking at the right temperature. If you're using a different oven you might want to add a different temperature so that you can keep that temperature in mind as you're baking. It really depends on the oven that you're using. So if you're just starting out you've got a new oven we recommend doing some white tester pieces. Now the reason why we say white is because it will be easy to tell if your oven temperature is too hot because you'll be able to see that they're slightly burnt. Whereas if you do your tester pieces in a darker colour you may not notice this. So get your tester pieces, pop them in the oven and from there you can adjust the temperature higher or lower depending on what you find it needs. Now I promised at the start that I'd just be doing some white tester pieces and then I'll be doing some white tester pieces. You might that we would go through a few of the frequently asked questions that we get so here they are why is my polymer clay bendy we've already touched on this polymer clay it does have plasticizers in it so unlike some other clays it will be bendy if it is cured correctly why is my clay brittle once it's baked so there generally are two reasons for this so one of them is going to be all of the baking temperature and time stuff that we've discussed today the other reason it could be though is the type of clay that you're using a common thing that we see for beginners is that they start making jewelry with Sculpey 3. now Sculpey 3 is an excellent modeling clay but it isn't so good for making earrings and you will probably find that if you do make earrings out of Sculpey 3 that it will be brittle once it's baked so if you are looking to use Sculpey clay we recommend using Sculpey primo or Sculpey souffle there are a range of other clays out there on the market like the cernut range fimo perineum and the other clays that we've talked about in this video so if you're looking for a professional that are also excellent for making jewelry with so just do your research before you try out a new clay can i increase the temperature that i'm baking at to make my pieces bake quicker no your pieces will burn do i need to tent my pieces now for those that don't know what tenting is basically it means just putting a piece of foil over your clay while it's baking so that the tops of them don't burn now we don't ever tent our pieces and we don't find that our pieces burn so it might be that for those people that are tenting their clay pieces it could be that the element in their oven is quite close to their clay pieces while they're baking and this can be quite common in toast ovens so i would just test to see if you need to tent your pieces if you do find that you've got your clay baking at the correct temperature and it is still burning then it is something that you can explore and see if it works for you what baking surface do i bake my pieces on now this is going to come down to personal preference as well so we almost always bake our pieces on a gloss ceramic tile we like working on gloss ceramic tiles and we can then just pop them in the oven afterwards but there are a range of other things that you can bake on some of the common ones that we see are either baking paper or also just normal copy paper so again have a play around and find out what works for you do i need a special oven to bake polymer clay can i bake my clay at the correct temperature and i can't bake my clay at the correct temperature and i can't bake my clay in no you don't need a special oven it's not like some other ceramics where you need to put them in a kiln you can bake polymer clay in your normal ordinary oven now if you don't want to bake in your normal oven that is totally fine you can look at one of those mini toaster oven options you will probably find though that they do seem to be a little bit more fickle with getting the right temperature so you will probably have to do just a little bit more testing to make sure that you get your baking temperature correct can i bake in an airfryer so we actually tested this and found that we could cure our clay correctly in an airfryer so it probably wouldn't be my first option because if your clay pieces aren't stuck down to your tile they will whiz around in there and probably destroy them but i guess it is an option is probably just not the best option can i bake my pieces in the same oven that i cook food in while polymer clay isn't food safe it is non-toxic so this is definitely not the right answer can i bake my pieces in the same oven that i cook food in while polymer clay isn't food safe it is non-toxic so i'll just put in the recipe if you have more questions on polymer clay so i will just explain this a little bit later. So yes, you can bake your pieces in your normal oven. It is recommended though, don't bake food and clay in there at the same time. And if you are to burn your clay in the oven, I would definitely recommend giving your oven a proper clean before using it again for food.

There are some areas that appear to be in shadow while others have bright, direct light hitting the surfaces.\n2.

This light source provides a localized and directed illumination to brighten up the area where the crafting is taking place.\n3. There are no specific lighting products visible in the image; however, the use of a phone's flash can be considered an impromptu or makeshift lighting solution for the task at hand.\n4.

She appears to be presenting or showcasing products, possibly at a booth or a sales counter. The lighting in the room seems natural and not overly harsh, suggesting it may be well-lit due to the presence of windows or other sources of ambient light.\n\n1. Lighting Problems/Challenges: There are no apparent lighting problems or challenges visible from this image. The lighting appears to be balanced and suitable for a craft shop, where displaying colors and textures is important.\n\n2. Lighting Solutions/Techniques: Based on the image, it's difficult to determine specific techniques or solutions being demonstrated without additional context. However, we can assume that the lighting is designed to create a welcoming atmosphere for customers, highlight the products, and provide enough light for the woman to present her items clearly.\n\n3. Lighting Products/Shown: Without more detail, it's hard to name specific products or solutions used. However, the presence of well-lit displays suggests that the shop has taken care to ensure proper illumination for their goods.\n\n4. Lighting Context: The context here is a retail space designed to showcase craft items such as fabric. The lighting seems adequate for display purposes and for the woman's presentation, indicating that there may be task-specific lighting solutions in place (e.g., focused spotlights, diffused overhead lighting).\n\nThe overall impression from this image is that of a well-lit retail space where the lighting is thoughtfully designed to enhance the appearance of the products and provide an inviting atmosphere for customers."

Visible lighting problem: There appears to be uneven illumination in the frame with one hand being fully lit by an artificial light source while the other is partially shaded or less brightly. This could suggest a single light source positioned at a shallow angle from the subjects, creating shadows on the right side of the image.\n\n2. Lighting solutions demonstrated: The image shows that someone is using a blue tape to secure another piece of blue tape over the existing tape. This action is likely done to fix or adjust the lighting setup, potentially by adding a layer of reflective material (like double-sided tape) to enhance light reflections, fill in shadows, or create more even lighting on both hands and the object being held.\n\n3. Specific lighting product mentioned: The person is using blue tape, which can be used for a variety of purposes but does not have a direct impact on lighting itself. However, it suggests a do-it-yourself approach to solving the lighting problem at hand.\n\n4. Lighting context: The image seems to depict an indoor setting where someone is holding up a product (a razor blade in this case) and appears to be showcasing its usage or demonstrating a technique related to personal grooming. The mood of the image is casual, and it looks like a snapshot taken during a routine activity."

Lighting Problems:\n   - The room appears dimly lit.\n   - The ambient light is soft and diffuse, which may not be suitable for specific tasks like reading or working on a laptop.\n\n2. Lighting Solutions:\n   - The woman is holding up a black light filter, suggesting that she is using it to either block out certain wavelengths of light (possibly to eliminate glare or control the color balance) or to create an effect for a photograph. This indicates that she is actively adjusting the lighting conditions in this frame.\n\n3. Specific Lighting Products:\n   - The black light filter being used by the woman is the only product mentioned, but it's clear from her actions that other lighting solutions may be employed depending on the context and task at hand.\n\n4. Lighting Context:\n   - Room Type: It looks like a room with low ceiling height, possibly a store or an office, given the presence of products on shelves in the background.\n   - Task: The woman is gesturing towards the items in the background, suggesting she might be discussing or demonstrating a product related to lighting, such as window treatments that could control natural light entering the room.\n   - Mood: The overall mood appears to be casual and friendly, with the woman engaging with the viewer through a video call or presentation."

The image demonstrates a need for better interior lighting within the oven to allow users to monitor the cooking process clearly. It could also indicate that additional ambient or task lighting might be required outside the oven, especially if cooking requires precise temperature monitoring or when the oven door is open.\n\n3. No specific lighting products are mentioned or shown in this image. The focus is on the baking sheet and the oven's interior as a whole.\n\n4. The lighting context here is focused on culinary tasks, particularly baking or roasting items in the oven. Proper visibility inside the oven would be essential for monitoring cooking progress accurately."

Demonstrated Lighting Solutions:\n   - Soft diffused lighting from above, creating a more even and flattering light effect on the objects below.\n   - Use of light boxes to provide additional fill light, reducing shadows and improving overall brightness.\n\n3. Specific Lighting Products Mentioned or Shown:\n   - Light boxes, which help distribute light evenly across the subject area, reducing harsh shadows and providing soft, diffused lighting.\n\n4. Lighting Context:\n   - The scene appears to be a still life arrangement with animal-shaped items that are likely meant for decoration or as part of a larger event or setup.\n   - The purpose of the lighting is to showcase these items clearly and attractively, which suggests the need for a gentle, even light to emphasize their shapes, colors, and textures without creating harsh shadows."

    "full_text": " How's it going guys? Welcome back to the Patriot DIY channel. In this video I'm going to be showing you how to add LED backlighting to your shelves. Alright guys, if you have a home bar or some shelves at home that you want to add some backlighting to, this is the video for you. Now I built these upper cabinets and shelves in a previous video. If you want to check that out, I'll put a link to that right here at the top of the screen. I love the way this looks and it fits perfectly here in my man cave, but today I want to add some backlighting to these shelves. This is going to be a pretty simple project that almost anybody can do, and I'm going to show you step by step how I'm going to do this. But first guys, if you haven't done it yet, make sure you hit that subscribe button down below, hit that notification bell, and give us a thumbs up. The main thing you're going to need for this project is going to be your LED strip lighting. Now you can use any LED strip lighting. You can use any LED strip lights that you want. This just happens to be the ones that I picked up. These are off Amazon, and I will have a link to these in the description below. Now I chose this one specifically for this project for a couple reasons. First, because of the shape of the strip itself. It gives me a nice wide surface here on the side to attach it to the back of my shelf, and it's going to direct all the light upwards, which is exactly what we want for the back of our shelves. Now one issue with a lot of LED strip lights is you don't get a constant stream of light. You're going to see a dot of light where every little LED is. And I chose these specifically because the LEDs are diffused and it gives you a nice constant stream of light. You can see here that you don't see each individual dot of the LEDs. You just get a long continuous light. Now I think these are going to be great for the back lighting on our shelves, but because this is so flexible, this could be used to create any type of design on your wall. You can spell out letters with it or anything you want to do. So I'm going to go ahead and do that. Now with that said, let's get everything taken down off of these shelves and get to work. Once I get everything taken down off of these shelves, I can remove them from the wall and get ready to install my lights. All right guys, so we have a few different options. We have a few different options. We have a few different options. We have a few different options. We have a few different options for how we can attach our LED lights to our shelves. The first option would be just to stick the LED strip to the back of the shelf like this using either double-sided tape or hot glue. And as long as you have a gap between your shelf and the wall, this would work out fine. Another option would be to use these little clips that came with the LEDs. You just screw these down to the board and then the LED fits right into that little clip. For my application. The way I would do that is I would attach the LED strip directly to the top of the shelf. Then I'd cut another narrow strip of wood and attach that in front of my LEDs. That way it hides them from view, but still allows the light to shine on the wall behind the shelf. The next option would be just to cut or route a channel directly into the top or bottom of the shelf, whichever direction you want your light. We'll cut that channel the same width as our LED strip, and then it'll just fit down into that groove. Like an inlay. It'll be perfectly hidden, but still shine up in the direction that we want it. I think that'll give us the cleanest possible look. And it's pretty simple to do as long as you have a table saw or a router that you can route that channel with. So I think that's what I'm going to do. Let me know what you guys think in the comment section below. Which method would you use for attaching these to your shelves? First, I need to set the height of my table saw blade to just a little more than the width of the table saw blade. I'm going to use a table saw blade that's a little more than the height of the LED strip. And then I'll run my shelf through the table saw cutting a groove all the way down. Now this groove is obviously not wide enough for the light to fit into yet. So I need to move my table saw fence over and then run the board back through, widening that groove. I'm going to keep doing that a little bit at a time, test fitting the light as I go until I get a perfect fit. Now you are able to cut this light at designated spots along the strip, so I'm going to test fit this light. And mark the length. I'm going to cut it down to the length that I need and then cut it down to size. To attach this permanently, I'm going to run a bead of hot glue down that groove and then fit this light down into place. Now I'm going to take my table saw and I'm going to cut this down to the length that I need and then cut it down to size. Then I'll press it down to make sure it sits just below the top surface of the shelf. You can see now that this gives us a nice clean professional look. I'm going to cut this down to size. I'm going to cut this down to size. The only thing left to do now is to reinstall our shelves on the wall and route our wires. I'm going to cut this down to size. On the bottom shelf, I've cut a small notch onto the end of the board and I'm going to be running this wire up under my cabinet. I'm going to cut this down to size. Then on this middle shelf, I've cut a notch into the back of the cabinet so I can route the wires behind it and then down to our outlet. I'm going to cut this down to size. Alright guys, so now we've got our LED strips inlaid into our shelf. I'm going to cut this down to size. Alright guys, so now we've got our LED strips inlaid into our shelf. I'm going to cut this down to size. Alright guys, so now we've got our LED strips inlaid into our shelf. We've got our shelves back installed and I routed the wires back behind my upper cabinets down and behind my refrigerator. These light kits do come with a little touch sensor switch that you can put in line with the lights. This is going to do a couple things for you. You can adjust the brightness level. You can also turn it on and off with this switch here. What I decided to do instead was to plug it into one of these wireless remote control outlets. You just plug your lights into the receiver. You can also turn it on and off with this switch here. You can also turn it on and off with this switch here. You can also turn it on and off with this switch here. And then you have this handy dandy little wall switch that you can mount anywhere you want to and it works exactly like a remote. So all you have to do is. And there you go. Now this same switch controls my neon signs and my string lights that I have up along the ceiling. So with just one click I can turn all that on at the same time. Now I love the way this looks. Guys I love that light shining up. Now let's get the stuff back up on the shelf. these shelves and take a look at the final product. All right guys that's it for how to add backlighting to your shelves. I hope this video helped you out. If you guys have any other methods that you guys would use to do this make sure you let us know in the comment section below. I love how this turned out guys. I thought these shelves looked good already but this just added a little bit of a difference. So I'm going to go ahead and show you a whole nother level. Now don't forget guys I will have links to all the products we used in the description below if you want to do a project like this for yourself. So thanks for watching guys. Please like, share, and subscribe and we'll see you next time. you",

There are areas that are overly lit, creating harsh shadows, while others remain dimly lit. This inconsistency can make it difficult to see certain details clearly.\n\n2. The solution being demonstrated appears to be the use of a reflector or diffuser, which is designed to distribute light more evenly and reduce the formation of harsh shadows. The tools are placed in front of this reflective material, suggesting that it's being used to soften and diffuse the light source.\n\n3. While specific lighting products aren't mentioned or shown directly in the image, the use of a reflector or diffuser is implied by the context. This technique can help achieve a more balanced and even illumination, which would be beneficial for tasks such as working on tools and other DIY activities.\n\n4. The lighting context appears to be a work area or a space dedicated to DIY projects. The presence of tools suggests that this might be a place where people work on hands-on tasks requiring clear visibility of their work. The mood created by the lighting setup is one that seems conducive to concentration and productivity, which is appropriate for such an environment."

The room has an artificial light source, possibly from overhead fixtures or lamps, but it is not providing uniform illumination throughout the space. There are darker areas where shadows are more pronounced, such as on the back wall of the room where bottles are displayed.\n\n2. The lighting solutions being demonstrated involve adjusting the position and angle of the available light sources to create a more even distribution of light. This could be achieved by moving or repositioning the lamps to better illuminate areas that are currently underlit, like the corner where the man is standing.\n\n3. There are no specific lighting products visible in this image. The lighting seems to rely on traditional ceiling lights and possibly natural light coming from outside of the frame.\n\n4. The lighting context suggests a casual indoor environment, likely a home bar or a similar space. The mood appears relaxed and conversational as the man gestures towards the camera. However, due to the low ambient lighting, tasks that require clear vision might be challenging in this setting. Improving the overall light levels could enhance the visibility of items on display, such as bottles and glassware, and make the space more inviting for socializing."

The light is evenly distributed across the subject, but it doesn't seem to have a strong direction or intensity, resulting in somewhat flat and even illumination. This type of lighting might not provide enough contrast or dramatic effect that could enhance the visual interest of the scene.\n2. The lighting solution demonstrated here is a person using a handheld LED light panel to enhance the lighting on the subject's face. The LED panel provides directional light, which helps create shadows and highlights, contributing to a more dynamic and engaging image.\n3. The specific LED light panel being used in this scenario is not visible in the image provided. However, it can be inferred that the use of an LED panel over the existing FPL is improving the overall lighting quality by adding directionality and intensity.\n4. The context of this image is a workspace or room where someone is engaged in some sort of manual activity or task, possibly crafting or assembling something, given the presence of a workbench. The mood appears to be focused and concentrated due to the close-up shot of the person handling the LED light panel."

Additionally, there are no visible artificial lights within the cabinetry that might be used during tasks requiring more focused illumination.\n3. There are no specific lighting products mentioned or shown in this image. The individual is simply working with the available natural light.\n4. The lighting context here appears to be related to a storage room, possibly a kitchen pantry or a workroom for woodworking or cabinetry installation and maintenance. Natural light is often preferable in such tasks because it allows for accurate color perception, which can be important when selecting items from shelves or working with materials. However, this lack of proper artificial lighting could make certain tasks challenging due to the low light conditions inside the cabinetry."

It appears that there is not enough light, making it difficult to see small details or perform precise work.\n\n2. Lighting Solutions or Techniques Demonstrated:\n   - The person is using a flashlight to focus on specific areas and provide additional illumination. This shows a common solution for supplemental lighting in situations where the main light source is not sufficient or appropriately directed.\n\n3. Specific Lighting Products Mentioned or Shown:\n   - A cable can be seen, suggesting that this person may be working with electronics or wiring. It does not directly relate to lighting solutions but indicates a task that requires attention to detail in areas of low light.\n\n4. Context (room type, task, mood):\n   - The context appears to be a workspace or DIY area where someone is performing some form of repair, assembly, or troubleshooting. The person is closely examining something on a wooden surface, and the use of the flashlight implies that precise work or inspection is required. There isn't enough natural or artificial light in this setting, making it challenging to complete tasks effectively.\n\nOverall, the image highlights the importance of adequate lighting for various tasks, particularly when working with small parts or electronic components where precision is key. The use of a flashlight in this situation serves as a quick and portable solution but may not be ideal for extended periods of work. Proper task lighting or adjustable desk lamps would be more effective and comfortable solutions for such situations."

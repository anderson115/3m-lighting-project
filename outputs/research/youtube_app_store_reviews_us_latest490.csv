It’s not just convenient — it’s empowering. It helps people like me learn smarter, stay engaged, and actually finish what we start. I truly hope YouTube keeps this feature free and accessible to everyone who needs it, not only those who can afford it.

But this is completely undermined by the fact that the platform punishes them for things they are completely in their rights to do (fair use). Meanwhile the platform has no standard when it comes to the advertisers they allow! I have seen medical scams, financial scams, gambling ads, political extremism, and even hardcore pornography (with AI filters) advertised over and over. I report it for clearly violating the “standards” youtube claims to have but it is ignored and nothing is done. It feels like this company is asleep at the wheel and allows abuse of every system they have. This isn’t even mentioning some of the UX problems that exist, but at this point that is secondary. If Youtube didn’t already dominate the market it wouldn’t make sense to continue using the platform.

On YouTube you can buy or rent content. The one thing I wish would happen is buying TV shows as a single purchase for those like me who want to buy them all at one time. Offer a discount for a total show purchase to entice frequent buying. Offer discounts for those who buy a lot, especially at one time,Like Smallville. Right now there are seasons, if I bought it right now, I believe 2 or 3 of the later seasons I would have to purchase individually each episode. That’s not cool at all especially 10 seasons. I have two more shows of Star Trek, and I’ll have them all on my phone. 

Loads of options on YouTube too. Fast play, slow play. Video upload. Share with everyone in an instant. Disney doesn’t have that. They just lube you up, bend you over and stick it to you just to get a few more bucks.

Please establish in-app controls, age limits and restrictions even on YouTube web versions.

Greedy and blame everything on rates skyrocketing on anything but that they’re greedy. Idc about your trade wars. We are the casualties. Dumbest move is that they don’t know people will get used to not having their services. We are human beings. We always find a way.

Now it’s riddled with AI slop, pornography disguised as kids content, and low effort green screen kids stealing content. It’s almost as if there is no you in youtube anymore and the platform clearly caters towards large creators such as Mr Beast. The recent introduction of AI powered age verification further sinks the platform as it requires biometrics to verify my age in order for me to be able to watch firearms content. Google now has access to my biometrics and can easily sell my data to Flock or Palantir which means that I can be surveilled even more by big tech. What happened to parenting and why do I have to pay for it. Short form content made the platform way worse and it feels like youtube is trying to cater towards kids addicted to quick dopamine hits. Get Odyssee if you want a video and file sharing platform. It’s run by good people trying to bring back the internet of the 2010s and actively promotes small creators that contribute to the platform.",1

It can get confused and wait forever to load a video even when the Internet has come back, so you have to refresh the app sometimes. YouTube policies are a blight for many reasons. For example the algorithm necessitates that creators to use all caps click bait headlines with provocative words to get any chance of an audience. So you will be embarrassed if you open your YouTube app around your parents and they think you will be wasting your time on slop. The policies are horrible to creators, for example music teachers will get their videos taken down and demonetized if they teach music that is copyrighted. In that way it partly is causing all the good old music to disappear. Even if a car drives by with its radio on the entire video could be taken down and all of the creator’s work gone. YouTube elevates videos with salacious or meaningless drivel, and carefully selects out videos with deep or difficult subjects. Somehow people still make meaningful content that is not taken down— or through their great effort they get it put back up. This is at a loss to themselves since demonetizing a new video ruins its chance to make money for the creator. Overall, YouTube on Premium is good enough to be my primary source of media, as I get all news, independent news, podcasts, entertainment, comedy, music, and science on the app.",0

You use to not care if YouTubers posted videos of games with music and sounds that is already part of the game. That being said you used to allow users to upload anything they wanted regardless of what was played or used. When people stream games on YouTube people who watch want to hear the game music and sounds and not something in the background drowning it out especially kids. I was trying to become one and then you just go and start flagging my videos as copyright just because I had music playing that was already part of/in the game I was playing. Do you really honestly think all the people that have posted videos and played games the way they are got permission from all the creators and gaming companies? I seriously doubt that.🤦🏼,0

Ça coupe le rythme, ça fatigue, et ça donne juste envie d’aller ailleurs.

Although, after reading other people’s comments, I definitely agree theirs more ads than their needs to be just to watch a small video. Another that I’ve been noticing lately is the “members only” videos, I notice some YouTubers are doing it but it feels very limited to watch other videos and shouldn’t have to pay to watch them.

They take your money and raise the fees and decrease what you get for it and they never ever ever bothered to improve it or make it even run correctly on your device.

Hundreds of videos pop up in the “Recommend” each week and they are clearly AI generated and often full of errors, wrong information, and annoying content. 

Is there anyway YouTube can spot or tag videos that are AI generated so we can choose better quality content?

Suddenly, now, Nov 2025, they age-gate my acct (and millions of others) into mandatory kids mode — claiming their AI has determined that my acct use and I appear to match the pattern of someone under 18.
…Two things:
(1) I watch news, politics, philosophy, science, college lectures, and technical instructional vids. Stuff that would bore a child to tears.
(2) If I were under 18, my account age itself would mean that I —more than 17 years ago— would’ve signed up for Gmail, linked that to my YT user profile, and begin using it all AS A 9-MONTH OLD INFANT.
In order to unlock my account from gated kids-mode, they demand photo ID and/or credit card info.

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: VALIDATED JOBS TO BE DONE
## Consumer Lighting Installation - Comprehensive JTBD Validation & Strategic Synthesis
### 82 Video Analysis with Framework Compliance Review

---

## I. ANALYSIS SCOPE & METHODOLOGY VALIDATION

### Dataset Integrity
- **77 videos fully analyzed** (5 missing from dataset: 28, 29, 30, 37, 47)
- **Zero sampling or automation** - every video read individually
- **Full data reviewed**: Transcripts, emotional audio analysis, visual frames
- **200+ JTBD signals** initially extracted
- **Rigorous validation** against JTBD framework standards applied

### JTBD Framework Standards Applied

**Legitimate JTBD Must Be:**
1. **Stable over time** - Not tied to current technology/solutions
2. **Solution-agnostic** - Describes the job, not the solution
3. **Progress-oriented** - About achieving desired progress/outcome
4. **Measurable** - Has clear success criteria
5. **Contextual** - Includes circumstances triggering the job

**Three Job Dimensions:**
- **Functional Jobs**: What consumers are trying to accomplish (task/outcome)
- **Social Jobs**: How consumers want to be perceived by others
- **Emotional Jobs**: How consumers want to feel during/after

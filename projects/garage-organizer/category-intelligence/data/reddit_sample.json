Even if he wants to tinker with the positioning and storage of some stuff, I can tell you put a lot of thought into the design and layout. It's really easy to get caught up into constantly keeping up with projects and work and not ever getting around to the meta aspects of tool storage, garage design, whatever. All the hooks and hangars to get stuff off the floor, the organization, the extra surface space, the LIGHTING! Dudes LOVE to spend time in the darkest shit-lighting garages. \n\nYou really did something. Great job!",

I've been completely happy with Gearwall for the big wall of my garage. It's great for hanging the ladders, shovels, brooms, large tools, kids bikes, etc... But try to find a good screwdriver or wrench holder for Gearwall and it's a real struggle. You have to look at aftermarket solutions or make your own.

I didn\u2019t want to just hammer in a nail either, cuz I tried that once and my skateboard nearly fell on my foot. For strollers, I\u2019ve used these heavy-duty utility hooks from the hardware store. Just screw them into a beam in your garage and hang the stroller by the handle\u2014super sturdy and no fancy tools needed. IIRC, they only cost me about $5 each, which was pretty price-efficient for my wallet. As for skateboards, I rigged up a DIY wall mount using an L-shaped shelf bracket. Just mount the bracket to the wall and you can rest the skateboard on it. Keeps it nice and snug and looks kinda cool too. I cut a couple pieces of rubber from an old bike tire tube and wrapped them around the ends so the board doesn't scratch or slide off. \n\nAlso, have you checked out those pegboard wall setups? They\u2019re pretty cool for organizing stuff without taking up much floor space. You can customize it with different hooks and pegs to hold everything just right. I found a friend getting rid of theirs, so I got it for cheap, but even new ones aren\u2019t too crazy expensive. It might be overkill for just a stroller and some skateboards now, but they\u2019re super handy once your kid gets bigger and picks up more hobbies. Anyway, hope this helps or gives ya some ideas to play around with. Kinda fun to MacGyver your own little garage system, ya know?",

It tends to better utilize space high in the cabinets.\n\nSome walls are good for nooks. Basically cut out the drywall between two studs and re-finish. There are a lot of YouTube videos.\n\nDepending on your layout, voids underneath or above staircases. Sometimes open shelves, sometimes drawers.\n\nSome rooms look great with a ceiling-level wrap-around shelving.\n\nWall mount TVs. It's easy and opens up more functional space. There are also recessed boxes for flush mounting TVs.\n\nIf you have a washer+dryer, there are some pretty good all-in-one units now that have heat pump and minimal venting requirements. That could free spaces beside or above for shelving or cabinets.\n\nWall-mount everything. Wall-mounted hooks for coats, bags, etc. In your bathroom, wall mount storage above the toilet for supplies. Use tall toilet paper holders.\n\nIf you have a garage, wall mount and ceiling mount everything. There are ceiling hanging metal storage shelves that are easy to add. Wall mounted bike holders. \n\nFinally, simply decluttering and pitching the things you haven't used in X years can go a long way. I cleaned out our pantry recently and it's like a magical amount of space now.\n\nAs for renting, I have always had pretty good luck mounting stuff to walls anyways. I don't cut into drywall, but wall mounting a TV was always fine. Double check your lease about move out conditions, e.g. if all holes need to be filled. Spackling holes is very easy.",

Most of my house looks like people's silverware drawer. My garage is floor to ceiling french cleat with custom hangers, racks, and cubbies for gloves, pest supply chemicals, car chemicals,  power tools, I made a FC cabinet for all my abrasives, a horizontal FC shelf for anything that looks like a screw driver, etc. I know where everything in my garage goes, and it takes up much less real estate. \n\nIn my kitchen, I've converted most of the lower cabinets into full slide drawers. I hate getting low and digging around, so I cut out the shelves,  made drawer boxes, added full length slides, and screwed the door fronts to the drawers. I like making bread, so I have a huge cabinet that stores 5 gallon buckets of fresh wheat and flour. I can move the boxes up and down if I buy a different size container in the future. \n\nIn the bathrooms (Some of these are in small bathroom / linen closets), there's small racks and drawers mounted for makeup, hooks for blow dryers and curling/ flat irons, shelf and bin for razors and attachments, a rack for jewelry, etc. I also have laundry hampers in the bottom of each of those little closets. First aid and medicines are in adjustable hardware boxes, \n\nI have a 4'X8' piece of 3/4\" plywood integrated into the drywall (2X5/8\" with green glue- Plywood textured and painted to match) covered with a ton of hooks (at varying heights) that generally just get used for my pants I wore for a 2 hour meeting that I don't want to wash until I've worn them longer, Sometimes my hats or jackets end up on them. Hat organizer on the back of the hall closet door, robe hooks on the back of all the bathroom doors, Specific spots for TV remotes, I have hoops on my lamps and side tables for my glasses, etc.\n\nEssentially, if it goes in a box / junk drawer, I don't want to use more than once a year. Otherwise, it should have a spot where it lives that fits the item, and how I use or a family member use it. For the record, it also keeps me from buying stuff.",

I wouldn't trust them if they were plastic (I'd be worry about them failing and me falling 10-14' feet.  Just a personal paranoia.  \nSame concern I have with collapsing ladders.",

There is going to come some time in the future when you want to be in your garage for an extended period of time and not deal with the heat or cold outside.  In the meantime, you are going to want to put things on the walls of your garage--shelving, hooks, cabinets, etc.\n\nI 100% vote for insulating the walls even if you don't have immediate plans to expand out there because you will someday.  Changing an overhead door from a standard to insulated isn't a huge deal and can be done over a weekend whenever you're ready for that.  Adding a split system for heating and cooling isn't difficult later on when you want it.  But adding wall insulation later is a huge pain in the ass.  If there are options for you to do it now, go for it.  It may be years before you thank yourself, but you will eventually thank yourself for having done that.",

    "body": "I did exactly this.  But I built a 3/4 wall separating it from most of the other side and drywalled it.  There was already a post there so I just extended it through; it covers most of the open side.  It gave me more space to hang stuff (and hung my bikes and shelves on the other side), a much better dust barrier, and I ran electrical through it.  Unfortunately my laundry is on that side as well as an access door, so I put up eye hooks in the ceiling and got translucent tarps that I hang from the door around to where the wall is.\n\nDust still gets through, but it's much better.  I'd eventually like to attach the entire thing to the ceiling and have it roll down like curtains when I need it.  I also think that if I use a little duct fan and pipe the air out that it'd create negative pressure to help keep dust out of the rest of the garage.  And, I have dust control - a Wen air scrubber on the ceiling, and a dust extractor with a Dust Deputy, that runs to my table saw, router, and chop saw.",

That\u2019s somewhere around $650 for 1/2\u201d at my local Home Depot and there\u2019s a discount for buying that many so it\u2019d actually be less I just don\u2019t know how much less. \n\nI\u2019d estimate 2 boxes of drywall screws would be enough. Probably $50? \n\nDrywall bit for your drill - they come in 4 packs. Around $10. \n\nIf you don\u2019t have a cordless drill, for something like this the Milwaukee M12 driver would do nicely. $200. Worth getting an extra battery or two. Call it $300. \n\nBox cutter + a long straight edge are all you really need to trim it, but if you really want professional looking cut edges, you could snag the Milwaukee M12 oscillating saw for another $200. Or their little cutoff wheel tool for the same. Either would be great. Both would be even better. Let\u2019s ball out and say both. So there\u2019s another $400 or so. \n\nWhat are we up to, $650+$50+$10+$300+$400? So about $1500 (rounded up for tax) in tools and materials. \n\nYou going to do insulation too? Add another few hundred depending on what you get. Rewiring things while you\u2019ve got it down to bare studs isn\u2019t a bad idea either. $140 for 250 ft of 12ga romex at Home Depot should be more than enough. Maybe another $150 for new breakers and a bigger panel box if you need it. \n\nWe\u2019re still not even to $2k yet. Let\u2019s see\u2026\n\nI have no idea how much that lift rental is for the ceiling but probably not much. \n\nBiggest thing is going to be time / labor to DIY. For reference, my garage is about 20x20, and it took me a bit over a week and a half to rip all the old walls and wood shelving out, install some new studs and reinforce old ones as needed, rewire everything including adding new outlets and runs for lighting, foam insulate the studs, install insulation, then drywall, then slatwall over it. It was a fun project and I used exactly the tools I just recommended it came out really nice and clean. \n\nYou\u2019ll also need a level, and either some wood scraps or something like [these air bags](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Winbag-Original-Patented-Air-Wedge-and-Leveling-ToolLifts-up-to-300-lb-2-Pack-E157302/303480393) to level things out as you mount them. \n\nBut yeah. I\u2019d definitely do it myself, buy the tools to have for future projects, and save $8k in the process.",

The builder completely finished the garage with sanded plaster, wood trim, and paint in a plain white color (Benjamin Moore Decorator's White). The original white color is still there above the slatwall. But that plaster just grabbed spider webs, bike wheel dirt, etc. And the cement floor was cold, had some cracks, and was annoying to clean. So I put a plain 1x5 board at chair-rail height, painted the bottom half with a commercial-grade Benjamin Moore paint (Scuff-X Matte, Oxford Gray), and swapped out the cheap Big Box Store pegboard panels for white slatwall from Diamond Life Gear.

Use many wood screws that are as long as possible without poking out the back side of that wall.\n\nI'm confident in the ability of those 2 items to provide ample strength, assuming the wall material hasn't been weakened. But without looking at how that wall structure is anchored at the top &amp; bottom I can't say that the cabinet won't cause the whole wall to fall over.",

We've frequently done this for clients, but it's really expensive at $111 per 16ftx1ft.\n\nMaybe look at what you'd spend drywalling and count that towards the slatwall.",

Based on the thickness and the additional images that you provided, that is highly likely to be a *slatwall* type of panel...\n\n*Slatwall* has been around for decades in one form or another.  A lot of us have likely seen it in stores with different types of adjustable shelving components mounted within those horizontal plows, displaying mostly shoes and such for resale - but sometimes lots of bigger, heavier items, too...\n\nTypically, it IS a sturdy product that \"sits\" on the floor, is anchored to wall structure, and can subsequently hold a decent amount of weight...\n\nIn this instance, though, without knowing how the REST of that decorative fireplace surround and structure are assembled, I couldn't reliably state that the build will hold up...\n\nHOWEVER, and for what it's worth, if this were me doing this work for myself, I would:\n\n[1]  Make sure that the decorative panel is NOT \"hanging\" - that it is firmly resting upon a solid build of *whatever* it is that is constructed beneath it!\n\n[2]  Open up a workable area of that panel approximately \"central to the flatscreen mount\"*** and \"frame\" or \"block\" out an extension that ties the TV mount directly to the actual wall structure behind everything...\n\n[3]  THEN I would mount that flatscreen through the panel and into the added bolstering, which would then fully cover that mod work from all eyes at every angle...\n\n*** \"Flatscreen mounts\" are NOT centralized to the flatscreens, themselves!\n\nAlthough NOT the same thing precisely, I've built similar structures before and currently have an unfinished work of my own - because I always wind up with \"reasons\" to not fully finish these things for myself on a timely basis.

Now my garage is the most insulated, air-tight room in the entire house.  it cost me about 2.5\" of inner space on all 4 sides.\n\nYou can buy electrical outlet extenders that sit on top of the box, with the existing outlets sitting on top.   like $2 at your local bigbox\n\n\n**edit**:  also if you did this, you could have put the rigid foam+drywall over the bottom brickwork, improving the aesthetics plus insulation.",

If you are able to go this route, also put heavy duty adhesive on the shelf cleat for extra holding power.\n\nYour idea has merit as well.

 So I picked up a ton of these Harbor Freight little organizer things. They were on sale last week for six bucks. So I decided to buy a bunch of them and make a rack for it. And this rack's really cool because I can put them wherever I want. Just mix and match and it even fits the double one. It just takes up two slots. But you can mix them more wherever you want. I want to show you how I made it. So it's just a square box. It's 16.5 inches wide. And then these are one inch wide strips 13.5 inches long. And they're 1.5 inches apart. And it's really easy. Let me show you how I made these. Now you can make a wood spacer or I actually have this ruler. They're exactly an inch and a half apart. And this ruler is an inch and a half wide. So I do is line it up with the one underneath and then give it a little mark. And now I have the top of where my next one's going to go. So I do it. Take a angle there or a square. And I slide it to where it lines up. Clamp it. And we'll glue it real quick. Now we're going to throw some glue on it and make sure you do the right side because obviously this is directional. I just use the little acid brush here just to spread the glue around. I don't know if this is really necessary, but I always like to do it. All right, back over to the box. Line it up with my square. Kind of line it up at the top and bottom where my point's pretty close to the edge but not sticking out. And throw a bread down in it. And there we go. Something satisfying about using a bread now. That's it. Throw it down one by one and now I'm up. And I've got a perfect little store track for all the little electrical connectors and things like that. Super easy to make by yourself and pretty cheap too. Just sheet of plywood and these $6 bins. Definitely better than Sorta-mo for the price they are.

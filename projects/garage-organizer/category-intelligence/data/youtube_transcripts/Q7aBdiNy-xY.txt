 I showed RIP style ones. The good thing about these ones is if you get crap underneath it or anything like that, you simply just get the hose in here and wash it out outside your garage. And you can get rid of any dust or grime from inside that. So it's quite easy to get rid of all the oil stains and stuff like that.

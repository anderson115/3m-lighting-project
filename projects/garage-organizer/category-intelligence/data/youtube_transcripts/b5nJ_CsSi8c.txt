 I'm so embarrassed to show this, but this is what my garage had looked like for a while, and I was so tired of it. Once I saw this super cute cobalt workbench at Lowe's, I knew it was time for a garage makeover. So first thing we needed to do was obviously take all of this junk, and I mean it, there was a lot of junk. Off the existing shelves in make room for the new setup. I also secretly love that this forced me to declutter so much of the stuff that had just piled up over the years. So once we got the workbench put into place, I then started going through everything to organize it into sections and put them into drawers. Then it was time to tackle this other shelving unit. I knew I wanted everything behind closed doors, so we found this 48-inch cobalt steel metal cabinet to put in its place. Assembly and installation of this cabinet was a lot easier than we thought, so once we got it into place and we got the doors back on it, I was able to start organizing things to put back in. We soon realized that one cabinet was not going to be enough though. So we went to the other side and started taking apart this one so that we could get one more cabinet in its place. Let's take a look back at the before and now the after. I'm so obsessed with this space. I love that everything is neat and tidy. It's in the workbench, it's in the cabinets, it's so much more functional for what I need, and it's just an amazing transformation. Comment below for the links.

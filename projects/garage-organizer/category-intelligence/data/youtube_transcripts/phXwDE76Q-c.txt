 The Harbor Freight Storage bin rack. This is a project that I built on the channel eight years ago. And since I have built it, I get asked the same two questions over and over again. The first one is, why did I make these shelves go all the way across? Why are they open in the middle? That was to save material and to save on the cost of building this. The second question I get asked all the time is, since these aren't supported in the middle, do these bins tend to warp or sag over time? And the answer to that question is no. This is the heaviest one out of the bunch. And it weighs right at 10 and a half pounds. And you can see it is still straight as an arrow. Now I have outgrown this one. You can see that I've got more stacked up here on top. So there are plans to upgrade this in the near future. But until then, I hope you have enjoyed my little update on...

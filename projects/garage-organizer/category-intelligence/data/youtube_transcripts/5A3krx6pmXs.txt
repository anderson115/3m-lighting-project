 You can build this tote rack in just 15 minutes. Basically, I'm going to have two frames and then connect those frames with runners. So all I have to do is measure out exactly where I want the underside of the lip of the bin to rest. Then we can just build the frames and screw everything together and it's going to give super fast. I'm going to flip it over and repeat the same thing on the other side. Push this in place and fill it up with some totes. You're going to attach it with a couple screws up top and then down on the floor. They should just slide right in. Perfect.

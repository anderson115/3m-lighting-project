 I recently found mouse poop in my garage and that sent me into a full blown disgusted panic. I ended up panicked buying every type of mouse chop I could find. If you want to know what mouse chop worked the best, let me know in the comments. After this situation, I decided what better time to make over the garage. I don't know about you, but the garage has always been out of sight out of mind, but I also want some function in here and as a DIYer, I really want my own workshop. After everything was cleared out of the garage and pressure washed and bleached, I started painting. I used an 18 inch roller which is a game changer for large spaces. Also, I'm only 5'2", so having a pull I could extend was necessary for me. Originally, I was only going to paint the walls, but then I decided to paint the ceiling too. Moving everything out of the garage was probably the biggest pain and also painting wasn't that great either. It really all wasn't that great. Even though I DIY a lot of things, I decided to hire out the epoxy floors. Mostly because we have a lot going on in our life right now and it's already starting to get cold here. They did a great job on our floors and my kids love being able to help. Now that the walls are painted and the floors are done, I can move on to the fun stuff. Here's what it looks like before and here's what it looks like now. Next up, I'm going to be building shelving for storage and building a different deck here. I can't wait all along to see the rest of the process.

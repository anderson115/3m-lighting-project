 Welcome back to Garage Day, where I'm on a mission to clean declutter and organize this space. Today I'm tackling the bits and pieces bin, which is my go-to spot for all those tiny random items that don't quite deserve their own container. Right now I have two bins full of miscellaneous small items. Most of them can probably be tossed, but there are a few that need to be sorted and saved. As you might already know, my favorite way to organize small items is by reusing gum containers. They're perfect for keeping things tidy while taking advantage of vertical space. I corralled all the shelf supports that usually end up rolling around at the bottom of the drawer. I collected all the cabinet bumpers that I could find as you can tell by how many I have. I've repurchased these over and over simply because I couldn't find them. I trimmed the sheets to fit the container better and now they're all together in one spot. Staples, the original packaging, disappeared long ago so into a gum container they go. These carabiners belong to the awning on our patio, yet another small item that always seems to vanish when I'm looking for them. And lastly, this exacto knife and replacement blades, I like to keep these all together. All of these are now neatly stored in the clear bin ready to be labeled for easy identification from above. I'm using my favorite label maker, the BrotherPTouch Q Plus, with white text on clear tape. It's the perfect finishing touch and adds that little bit of satisfaction to any organizing project. And there you have it. Five more additions to my bits and pieces bin. Each with a proper home, one more step toward a clutter-free garage.

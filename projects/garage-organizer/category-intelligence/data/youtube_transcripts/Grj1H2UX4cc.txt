 We took over this two car garage and let's be honest, it needed a lot of love. By the end of this video, our mission is to turn it into the ultimate two car garage. Step 1 was a planning and that wouldn't have been possible without the obsessed garage design team. We started by asking, what do I really need from this space? We're just 18 feet wide and 19 feet deep every inch mattered. After tons of brainstorming and back and forth, we designed what I believe to be the ultimate setup for my needs. The best part? I can see exactly how it would look before buying a single product, making sure we got it right the first time. Stick around because the way you see these 3D renders right now is exactly how this garage is going to look by the end of this video. Now that we have the plan, it's time to build. First up, paint and installing a proper Jack Shaft garage door opener. Once that was done, it was time for the floors. I chose Swiss tracks flooring and believe it or not, I knocked this out in just a couple of hours. Next, let's fix one of the biggest problems in the garage, the lighting. To free up space for the cabinets, I decided to relocate the water heater inside the house, because let's be honest, for us car enthusiasts, every inch of the garage space counts. And then, my dream cabinets arrived. Sonic MSS Plus cabinets. With the cabinets in place, it was time to tackle the wall mounted pressure washer setup for the washing station. I've never done anything like this, so I was terrified. It's also confident I could handle the plumbing and electrical myself. And just like that, we did it. Next up was organizing the walls and adding insulation to the garage, since I'd also install a mini split to keep the temperatures down here in super hot Florida. Last but definitely not least, I still can't believe this. I installed a hidden vacuum right inside my wall. I wanted to add a personal touch to finish it off. Well, welcome to the ultimate two car evolved garage.

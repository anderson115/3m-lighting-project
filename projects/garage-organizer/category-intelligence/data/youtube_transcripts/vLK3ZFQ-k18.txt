 Let's declutter and organize this kitchen using my four step declutter core method. I'm a professional organizer specializing in chronic clutter and ADHD, so I'm going to walk you through it step by step. Using my method, we work one room at a time, so step one is collect. We identify and collect anything that does not belong in a kitchen and set it aside to be re-homed later. Then we begin step two, categorize. We focus on one category at a time and collect likes with likes. Here we started with cups and glasses. Once they're all gathered, we're ready for step three, cut out. This is where you make your decluttering decisions and make a decision on each item. It's either a yes, you keep it or no, it goes. Once you're done, you move on to your next category. So here we're targeting all of the food storage containers. We're pulling them from every area that we find them and collecting them all together, so the client can see exactly what she has and can make informed choices. So we're repeating step two, categorize and step three, cut out over and over until all the categories in the kitchen have been addressed. We are getting paid to do an entire kitchen in one day, but when you're doing this on your own, just take it one category at a time. We finished all of the rounds of decluttering and these were all of the donations that she has and that she's ready to let go of. And it made so much space, so we are ready for step four, contain. We now figure out the layout and give every category a home, working with the storage we have and figuring out what fits where. And if you don't remember the before, this is where we started and this is our after.

 Welcome back to Garage Day. I'm on a mission to clean declutter and organize this space and today marks my final garage update for this summer. I'm hitting pause on this project for now and playing to pick it back up next spring. Organizing a large space like a garage can get expensive fast, so I wanted to share exactly how much I spent on organizing product for this side of the garage. Let's start with the biggest investment, the wall mounted cabinets. These were $344 each on sale, and I purchased three for a total of 1,032. To mount them, I needed three sets of brackets, costing 126 and 12 gear tracks that came to $192. I also added two shelves which were also on sale for $120 and a multi-purpose hook to hold the hose, which was $20. Inside the cabinets, I used a mix of storage solutions, extra large multi-purpose bins, accessory boxes, shoe boxes, tall shoe boxes, sweater boxes, deep sweater boxes, and boot boxes, all of which totaled $270. I had also previously organized my tool wall and wanted to include that in the total. I used two sets of white metal pegboards for 90 and added accessories that came to another $194. All in, the grand total for everything came to $2044. Was this more or less than you expected? And because I love the analytics behind everything, I shared 21 videos regarding this project with generated about $360 in income from views. Thanks to your likes, comments, and shares. So thank you so very much. I am always very appreciative of that.

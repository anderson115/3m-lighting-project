 Yes, it got cluttered again and no, it's nobody's fault. Let's talk about it. We're back two years later to declutter and refresh this garage in Bel Air, California. Like so many people, life gets in the way and in this case our client had another baby and the garage unfortunately became a dumping ground for so many things and our client reached out to us to get it back into shape. We were so happy to see that the systems that we had previously set up for our client were largely working and so it was really just a matter of clearing out the center of the garage and making a home for anything else that she did need to keep. A lot of the items that she needed to keep from the center were actually clothes from one of her older children for her youngest child to eventually grow into and some of the items really just needed to go back into her home and when I went inside of the home I found her two cute dogs. I mean, are you kidding me? We're two and a half hours in approximately to this garage refresh project and it's over here doing some sweeping because we're going to be putting some stuff away over there and I'm going to be working on that back closet. If your space gets re-cluttered don't get discourage just get back to decluttering. I know you can do it and it's a reminder of why routine decluttering is essential to long-term success and why it's so important for you to be mindful of everything that enters your home and if you need some extra support and motivation I'm here to help. Let's take a look at the incredible before and after that we were able to achieve in only four hours that day.

 So one of my favorite things to do on this channel is to take common workspace or storage issues and try to come up with a unique solution. This is a no space wasted vertical lumber storage system that will fit in just about any garage. So this rack is not only designed to fit in a 7.5 foot garage, but because of its angled structure, it will allow you to organize and store 8 foot lumber or plywood vertically. It's not only saves you a ton of room, but it also protects your material. So as you can see, we have several different storage compartments, eliminating any waste, and then we have 2 foot, 4 foot and 8 foot bays made for storing plywood or water planks. And then on the front, we have our dimensional lumber storage that can be organized in any way that you should like.

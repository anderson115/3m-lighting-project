 Look at this freaking guy right here. This guy makes $15,000 a month by building custom garage shelves and selling them exclusively on Facebook marketplace. And I know exactly how you can copy him. I have all the details. Here they are. He was making five grand a month while working a full-time job, borrowing his neighbor's truck and delivering these on the weekend. And to one day he said, babe, I'm going to quit my job. I think I could support myself. He did. And he tripled his income. He sells these for $770. He pays $200 in materials. And all he needs is a chop saw from Home Depot. How do I know this? Because I just spend an hour talking to him on my podcast. Where does he get his other customers? Where does he find materials for cheaper? How can he scale this? How can people copy him? Because guess what? These things are way too big to ship. So anyone in any little market could build these same shelves at the same plan and sell them for the same prices.

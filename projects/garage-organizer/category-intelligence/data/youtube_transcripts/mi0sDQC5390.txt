 My plan was to epoxy the entire garage floor, although here in Florida the hot tires can definitely do a number two epoxy. So when you commented short coatings, they actually reached right out to me. So of course I started to do my research and they actually had their own tent at TPC and invited Vinnie and I. The weather was definitely not on our side, so we only had limited time. But I did get to see their finished product in person, and let me tell you, it is absolutely gorgeous. I love the amount of flakes that they use in it. Sometimes with epoxy does not look like this. And they had so many different color choices to choose from. I'm thinking of something that's kind of tying in to our driveway and then also will look really good against the black cabinet in my East Coast DIY workshop. So I'm thinking of bringing in like the sand color, the beige and maybe some black specks. And then they also have these larger samples as well. And one of the big things to me is all of their installers work directly for the company, so they don't subcontract out anything. And because they stand behind they work, they actually offer a 15 year warranty. And I love how they do all the prep works. Right now we just have bare concrete, but if you had epoxy already, they'd actually just come and take that up for you. And another huge thing for me is that it's UV rated. Usually with epoxy, I'll end up seeing like a yellow line right across where the garage door is, but their product actually like seeps into the concrete. So you're not having to worry about any cracking. As you can see, some people even do their entire driveway. And when we're only there for about 10 minutes, such a bummer, they then actually got canceled because of the weather. But at least I got to see their product in person. So now it's just time to choose a color and get the garage ready for install. And of course right away, who they got to work and moved all of the boxes out of here. So stay tuned for the transformation of start coding.

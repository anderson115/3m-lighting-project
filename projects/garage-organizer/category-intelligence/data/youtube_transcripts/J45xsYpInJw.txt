 I am not looking forward to this. This garage is a total disaster and it's the last room that we really have to tackle in the house and because it's so big I thought it would be easy to organize and to keep tidy but I'm actually finding the office it is true there's just a lot of spots to just drop stuff and put it down and we have a busy family three kids we're coming in and because nothing's easy to put away we're just dropping it in a giant pile so the goal is to declutter zone and create real organizations so that this garage stays tidy all the time. Here's what's working in this garage it's big it's three times bigger than our last garage and I think like um that's part of the problem I want to park it here so bad friends I also want to place for our many many bikes and many many sporting equipment but I don't want to have to climb over things in order to get there so what we have to do first is zone some things are great we have access to garbage bins so like right off our kitchen we can throw out the trash and then wheel it out so that actually is great too Joe has a shop down the stairs totally working and that's about it my vision is to have this whole side zone for sports and play which means hockey bags all of our bikes all of our sporting equipment in one area and over here is zone for my vehicle and all like our vehicle type stuff let's get real man we don't need vehicle type stuff don't want to be in the video you're on what so I have to do every single week this is a longer this goes out there here this side it this trip over this yeah that's great yeah yeah I don't want to do that so this is gonna go which means that this needs a little somewhere and this needs a little somewhere yeah because right now Joe gets done playing hockey in the place it belongs is the floor but also the kids come home and just chuck their hockey stuff and get her here is it in yeah I in it's just now I got firefighter gear okay so step one Joe man yes let's clear this out my I might I pop my bike tire can that bike just go in the trash most people would just fix the tire let's do put it I'm not sure we're doing I'm not sure you there they put your stuff stuff like us what are we doing we're clearing yeah but where is it going because that's gonna go in there so we're stuff shopping we are but we're not gonna just do a lot of the bike in a circle I just girl it's so heavy firefighter you're right and we'll be doing this in 70 pounds a year wow the burning building huh okay cool oh see me oh my god this is heavy this is burning all through the ground speaking of things we've never ever used but seem like a good thing when did we get when did you get these casinos here's a go like where were we do remember we're in London we're we're in London that was like they're so cool four years ago we went to this we went to this toy store where they demonstrated the toys and I'm a sucker for a good salesman they also light up though it turns any shoes into roller blades once this garage is cleared out I am putting these on and I'm doing laughs okay in my light up cool things that they made look effort we're gonna hold you to this and do it to the end story happening I hope we don't break a bone apparently that's the midlife crisis for men right now and I'm feeling like you could do a pink skateboard gone are they yellow convertibles do it hey hey do a kick flip do a kick flip say what yeah all do a kick flip in here you can't do a kill when you what way you use a release it's on my donkey cove seeing anyone first it's the battle of the cooler people I'm gonna win you excited yeah no we moved in all the new organizing pieces from the container shorts the garage plus stuff so it's like heavy duty so we'll put it on this wall so Joe's gonna remove the we're gonna take the siding off the side in just out of it not all the walls but that we will they did they didn't go all the way up you're taking this down with top right office gonna go all the way to the ceiling all the way to the ceiling right so I either have to put more siding up or I have to take that siding down and you've said I wanted to look pretty like exposed brick and they make like sheets of wood that looks like exposed brick but we're gonna start thinking all that off yeah and that shelf commutes down down and then I have some work to do I'm excited I don't know all a lot you can make it all look good yeah I'm gonna come back when it's organizing time happy demo thank you so Joe finished this wall it looks absolutely amazing finished texture it has a little bit of texture I like it looks like exposed brick it's gonna be like bougie up in here so now you're gonna install the Elf and Good Archive the racks up yeah yeah you said you it you realized you made some errors I did do some errors I measured slightly wrong I didn't count for these things here that's okay we'll make it work we're making it work we're gonna cover them up we don't really need to and we're just adjusting but I'm excited this is gonna be amazing because garages are big like they like just don't come with enough storage which is why they are organizing light mirrors so this is gonna change this face order ceiling storage order ceiling let's go let's grab the start-in starter pulley sure yeah let's do that okay so the first thing I notice is how heavy this is it's so beefy so this is our first time using the Elf the garage plus system we've installed lots of outfits tons of outfits our favorite hands down system but this obviously can hold a ton of weights what's perfect for garage where you're storing really heavy things and just like a regular Elf you start with the track at the top and then you hang the standards off of it and the great thing is you can actually get these extended pieces so you can take it a full 12 feet I think it's 12 feet yeah this plus that which is amazing all of this it goes up in minutes it goes up very fast so we're gonna do that right now race to the top she's attended one one weekend training session and now if she's the safety police let's go let's race to the top race to the top I don't think you're supposed to have two people on one it's fine race you to the top it's one story we're going to get hurt if we fall on your mark come on feel free go sit go you're not all in top up buzzer buzzer me now that the top track is in place and it's level so simple we just grab the rails with the standards and hang them off and slide them into place where you want them and then we get to start adding all the components you have these brackets they're totally adjustable you just like drop them in and you can use them to put on shelving or drawers or like a workbench top anything you need and you can move these around anytime you want so I know it seems weird but what I think we're gonna do is we're gonna put a bracket at the very bottom you're like why am I putting it at the very bottom well I know why you're putting it on so we can go up this way because it's easier starting at the bottom so for measuring distance let me just make me sound smart yeah you're kind of right if we do start at the bottom we have to go she's she's right but I'm gonna put it to the very bottom and put a shelf right here yeah and you're like why am I putting a shelf on the floor it's because it's a garage so I need a can so we get ice and snow and water and I plan on putting a hockey bag right here so just by getting it off the ground it will be wet so it seems like a kind of a waste of a show but it's it's strategic and then it's going to keep everything dry which is honestly why we want with the alpha system in the first place over just like traditional shelving because nothing's on the floor not even brackets nothing's on the floor so everything's protected even if you get water it's just it's the perfect solution for a garage it's so excited right it's needed the drawers right nice love them how are you feeling pretty we always organize for the space not the stuff so you can probably see we're trying to optimize the storage with these components and we honestly have no idea what is actually good to go in it except I knew I wanted ball bags maybe some hockey sticks badminton rackets things like that on here which is why we got a pegboard but this is one of the biggest mistakes I see when it comes to organization is people worry too much about the stuff they have and they try to make their home fit their stuff but stuff is always changing you're gonna live in your home for 20 30 40 years and your things are always going to be rotating so always maximize the storage for the space you have and then make your stuff fit your organizing system because this whole wall is really for sporting equipment I love this bag this is going to just clip on here to this rail it's just like the top rack and then locks into place and then we can fill it with balls and there's a lot of hooks to choose from I have like lacrosse sticks and a bunch of things so I got this big hook here I love pegboards especially in garages for those quick access items so this is what we're gonna do we're gonna hang all our sporting equipment that we just forget we own or we need to grab fast starting with the badminton rackets that we literally love so much but because they were hidden we never play tons of balls we need to see all those balls really fast and are lacrosse sticks I'm also gonna use these little trays that you can get for pegboards for those quick access items like the laces in case we break them and extra mouth guards and of course you've got to have hockey tape we're getting stil shelves in here now because we are turning this into our like golf cabinet yeah we don't have culture going because we don't want them to get dusty so Joe is going to install some shelves do you want to put in the golf clubs to see the height sure these would mine they're purple we'll put yours in there too they look brand new I've used them two times my entire life yeah you'll have all those firefighting golf tournaments now yours also don't look that used friend so hot here it's okay you know what I'm just gonna do the bikes it is 87 degrees isn't that's like a million and I've been working I've been moving look at this garage single handedly all by yourself there was no team after right Emily Emily's back there going she looks pretty smart 96.8 degrees oh it's not 96 it feels like 36 degrees Celsius it's hot I don't know you're falling to my truck disagree oh it's hot it's hot you think you're meeting your truck it feels like it's like armpit hot it's 87 but it feels like a million it feels like the crush of the devil it's moist up in here it's moist it says the person this Spencer weekends literally crawling around and burning I do I do in bunker gear I've never slept so much I've lost some weight though it's all water it's all water but this is hot compared to this one now this alpha garage plus unit is done it looks fantastic and I have so much storage which is good because this side of the garage is a total hot mess I'd call this the messy middle it's like we shoved everything over here while we put this together and now I have to organize and go through and sort this disaster and I'm tired but that's okay hopefully it won't take long zoning all the sports over here gonna find spots for car stuff gonna donate things we're not using on your mark get set let's go to make my life a lot easier I'm gonna grab all the totes that I'm gonna use to organize over here and I'm gonna lay them out on the garage floor so as I'm picking things up I can immediately like toss it in the tote it's not gonna be where it's gonna live forever but this is like the fastest way to organize a big mess grab all your containers lay them all out and as you're bringing things over dedicate each toe for a different category of home like this is gonna be for life jackets one of another one for hockey cucks you get the idea this makes organizing and tidying a huge mess super fast I feel it had a breath and hot it's so it's so hot but the progress is giving you momentum it always feels like this is a huge job Joseph and this is gonna be a week to clear this side of the garage and I was like I can do it in less than a day and I really believe that because it's all about just picking something up and not stuff shuffling it putting it in a home a good enough home and if you don't have a perfect home put it in the place you look for it first and that's exactly what I'm doing this garage isn't gonna be perfect but it's gonna be so much better let's keep going it's time for some truth time uh this is all my husband's stuff he has a workshop down here but he likes these quick access tools here in the garage so that if he's fixing something he can just quickly grab it and it looks like this because he waits till later I'm gonna take a few minutes and just macro organize it put things where I think it should go and I'm gonna put a cabinet up here so instead of putting it down he can put stuff away and then he can go back and tweak it and make it perfect later but if you also have a spouse who tends to dump and pile this is a really fast thing that you could do to tidy it make sure you label it so they know where things are but that can really prevent the piling till later and if you come across something and you literally don't know where it should go it's okay to have a random I don't know where this goes been just trust your guy make a quick decision and put things in a good nap home this is gonna be what you disliked it's a good idea it's just not working for us to the long spot so it's got it it's got it's not this right so it's okay so I'm gonna grab a screwdriver and a drill where I can't I know for a first lash but we're gonna take it I want to smash it with an axe I learned to do some axe work this weekend at firefighter school and I want to put my you know but it will make less of a mess in the long run and I think it'll be quicker if I just this something to do now that all the sporting equipment has a place to go this wall is free so I'm gonna move in the new heavy duty bike racks from the container store and put all our bikes along in this wall we are in the home stretch and I'm hot and tired but this is the most exciting part we finally have a proper home for our many many many hockey bags this is exciting so one for Joe one for Milo one for Abby and for Joe's coaching bag everything has a home this is amazing all the stuff that was in the big pile got moved either into a cabinet or into these great white bins I love white bins it looks like simplicity I'm gonna slap a label on them throw them up and it's gonna look fantastic now that I've a ton of room I'm gonna give this full garage a really quick clean I definitely need to invest in a much bigger mop it looks really good in here I want you don't remember what it looked like before it wasn't terrible but it was cluttered it was like our family's dumping ground and I never wanted to spend any time in the year I was in Barris every time the door opened it was like my dirty secret and now it's super organized I'm so happy that this is done it was a lot faster than I thought you can do the same thing in one weekend it really comes down to roll it up your sleeve sprens decluttering zoning creating different spots for all of your things and getting a great system to get your stuff off the floor and like put somewhere big thanks to the container store for helping out with this video and giving us this incredible alpha garage plus system it just transformed this garage and I'm so

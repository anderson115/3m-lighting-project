 Here's a brand new day, ayy Wake up every morning and say here's a brand new day, ayy Take a good day, make it great, okay Cause it ain't got some limits, make some lemonade Yeah, take those clouds away, here's a brand new day, ayy Here's a brand new day, here's a brand new day, okay, okay My whole life got them hit me down, but what that man was, I had my family run Welcome or welcome back Here we have a judgment free zone, please, it's ridiculous We have jet skis right here obviously that need to be pulled out Once the jet skis are out, there's still so much stuff in here A lot of it needs to be sold or donated or even just put away But today we are going to be decluttering a ton, a ton I'm gonna try to do my best to really be ruthless Really realize like things that I actually will come in and here and grab before Because I actually do come like sort through some of this stuff randomly Like, oh I need this, oh I need that But it's clearly a mess to do We have like bikes from the boys and all these things But it's like a lot of the things don't even actually work anymore Or something happened to them and so we need to go through all that too So there's just a lot, it's gonna keep me busy all day long Possibly going into tomorrow If I don't stay completely on task We're gonna head inside real quick, I have some boxes that I'm gonna go ahead and just tape up So that I can put like all the decluttering items and things that maybe want to store away or something And then we'll come back out and get to work Also, I'm gonna show you one of my like favorite little quick meals That I've been having, it's like one of my hyper fixations right now And it's very very quick and easy to do So I'm also gonna show you that and then just because otherwise if I don't eat now I will not eat the entire day that I'm working And it's very hot, it's like almost a hundred So let's get into it No struggle cuz I'm coming up Yeah, I came to get loud Won't keep my head down There's no stopping now Watch out here I come I am strong I am resilient I go hard I need a million Oh I am strong I am the greatest Alright, so before we jump into the kitchen to make my lunch which I am so starving right now And before we get into the garage and all the hot heavy lifting I am not looking forward to it It'll be worth it, I'm just, I'm not there yet But before we get into all of that, I did wanna say a huge thank you to Loomie for teaming up with me in today's video You may have seen their products in stores or online I know for me, I was already familiar with their products before even got the opportunity to try them out After the last several years, I have tried so many deodorants like natural deodorants The natural ones, honestly just a lot of them don't work that great And then the non-natural ones always irritate my skin like I will get rashes and I'll break out So when I got the opportunity to try out Loomie, I was a little bit apprehensive because of that I was incredibly blown away like this stuff has been incredible, I love it But Loomie is a whole body deodorant It can be used anywhere on your body like pits, privates and beyond It works anywhere that tends to get a little smelly, it works great during hot outdoor work days, during Pilates Like workouts, things like that And I'm even woken up the next day and everything still smells amazing Which makes sense because it's clinically proven to block body odor all day and continues controlling bio for 72 hours It was actually invented by an OBGYN Shannon Kingman And what's so unique about Loomie is that it stops odor before it happens A lot of deodorants just try to combat the scent or the stench or smell whatever you want to call it Whereas Loomie actually works to prevent it They come in eight different scents This one is by far my favorite, this is the toasted coconut They have lavender, they have fresh scents, they have really natural scents, they have all different options for you And it's also super nice that they have so many different options for application This invisible cream, they of course have a traditional stick deodorant They have this super convenient spray and they even have a body wash and these deodorant wipes are super nice for on the go I feel like my personal favorites are the traditional stick and then actually the body spray Now you can find these in the store which is super convenient But you can also get the Loomie starter pack which is a great way to save over 40% off And it comes with free shipping, that includes a full-size deodorant, either the cream deodorant tube or the spray deodorant And then two free gifts like the mini body wash or the little wipes And Loomie gave me a great deal to share with you guys Which will give you an extra $5 off when you use my link down below in the description box And then just use the code tcl at checkout Make sure you get the advantage of that deal, this is just going to be a great time to try them off for the first time Or stack up if you're already familiar with them You guys are going to love them, but now that's head into the kitchen makes me a wee food and then get to work in Okay, so we're not going to do like a whole bunch of recipe stuff I just want to show you like my super quick done in 10 minute lunch and it doesn't actually take me that long So if you have an air fryer, it's like my best friend right now Do yourself a favor, get some liners, they're very affordable And then you don't have to clean your air fryer constantly So basically, I've been on and off, but I'm on to doing like clean keto like low carb So basically you just get pepperonis, you just want to make sure they are like a thicker cut I lay out six of these and these pepperonis are going to serve as your crust Because they'll get very crisp in the air fryer So then we're just going to sprinkle some cheese on top of each pepperoni And you can put as many of these as you want, I just can only fit six So that's what I do, but actually that's like very filling You can leave it as is, I've done it just like this before, it's almost just taste like a pepperoni and cheese pizza Or you can go the extra mile and add some little olives or whatever your favorite toppings are for pizza I love green olives, so I'm just going to add a little amount to each And kind of just customize this to whatever you want Now I'm going to pop this in my air fryer for 10 minutes at 400 degrees So while that's cooking, I'm just going to slice up some cucumber I love to add extra veggies into my meals You'll have to kind of play around with it because the spice that I have to share is actually just something local to us It's horis, habit, and it's basically like habanero sea salt with garlic I don't know if you can find this online, but it's here just local in Arizona I found it at like a farmer's market Slice your cucumbers up and then all you're going to do is like season them with that And it's so good, like you don't need any diff, you don't need to do anything else to them And it's adicting honestly I just crave this right now Little salt flakes, kind of chunky salts And I like these because they give it just a little bit of heat but not much And then like some garlic flavor I love cucumbers anyway, but it feels just a little extra And then all I have to do is just wait for the air fryer to finish cooking And once we've done, very, very quick, very easy and very flavorful It's super yummy Wanna shape the new Do you wanna, do you wanna come along with me Come along with me, do you wanna And we ain't got nothing, gotta do something again Alright, we're finally ready to get going out here I'm like dreading this, I feel like starting is always the worst Like where do you start exactly? I think I might actually just start with like all the bikes that we have Arizona has been really hard on our bikes I don't know if it's just the heat, I know cactus have been an issue here So I don't know what the deal is but like so many of the bikes we've gotten and like these stop working Or I don't know, anyway so I'm gonna go ahead and start pulling out bikes I'll pull out the ones that I know work really good And then I'll put the others in like a different section Making this site if we're gonna try to fix them to sell them or what we'll do with that But I'm actually just gonna go for like big bulky areas that are easy You know I take out like six bikes or five bikes or whatever it is And that's a huge spot cleared out and that's going to boost my motivation feeling like Hey, I'm getting some work done like it's we're feeling motivated now And then we'll be able to get into like all the nitty-gritty It's a lot of work so let's do this Something that's gonna save you a ton of time is Instead of like every time I find a piece of trash like going to the trash Or every time I find a tool in this big pile where there's a ton of tools Is to get like buckets or whatever And put like items with like items and then once you're done clearing out Then I could take this and like you know put this in the drawer This goes put the other things where they go But it's gonna save you a lot of time and a lot of effort So definitely go for that I really wish you could sing out loud with your pods in And not sound like an idiot to all your neighbors I just think to music because it just helps me like totally zone out And I want to like bust out singing but I know already we'd be like What is she saying over there? So I'll sing in my head as we keep going Or making some progress See how like I haven't even done that much and it looks like progress And you guys ever get ridden around on this as a kid that's like the best And the way that I'm doing this is everything that I touch gets sorted into these buckets And it goes into either trash tools or bike items And then anything else either goes into a declutter pile in the driveway Or some items just get pulled out to the driveway to create more room and space That way I can organize them back into the garage later Okay, I think all of these are for like the scooters And then these ones are for the bikes that they like use all the time So I'm gonna heat these out, put these away for now And at least organize them here or like in a bundle in here So it'll be good Just to like temporarily organize these bike chargers I'm just gonna use command hooks right on to here That way they're organized on the ground But then like when they're done charging they can just kind of like hook them up here And be able to find exactly which one they need It's not perfect but it's better All right, these are all over here testing like which ones the chargers work on And then I'm gonna use these ones I'll hold the charge cause I feel like at least two of them maybe three are like something strong with them And working on that over here and then Obviously all this but good news is this side is like looking pretty nice All right, once again I'm kind of feeling overwhelmed and stuck Because although that is done, now we have all this And this is a bunch of like random stuff Now like the kayak, we'll sit with the jet skis There are a few things where I know where they go But everything else, it's like a lot of things don't have a home So I'm gonna have to decide are we getting rid of them because they don't have a home Or are they worth making a home for I feel like those are the two big questions When you're going through spots like this Do they have a home then put them there If you don't have a home for them, do they deserve a home in your home? You know what I mean? We'll see I can't believe someone like me is here with somebody like you Just ask him about you and I know why I'm gonna tell you why it is It's saying you're smart and you're feet That's gonna be for free Whoever wants to come get it Alright, I think it's time to tackle some of these things They are sitting in the sun so they are literally so hot and baking But I gotta go put them away Where they belong Make sure these are always closed If you have things like this, they've definitely lifted them up And then had to play like 200s free pickup That's not fun Woo-hoo, I know that you're worth it Woo-hoo, cause got your perfect amazing That I can see you It's never due expect from someone so perfect Organization makes such a big difference Also this little caddy I got years ago is so nice because it's sturdy And you can take a bunch of your tools with you The only caveat you have to put them back when you get home Or when you finish your project So just a little thing So I found this video later in the same week that I filmed Last week's video which was my Spring Clean and Decorate I'll link that one up here if you guys haven't seen it yet But I was definitely feeling a lot more positive And this week has been rough It's been so emotional I've just been struggling again Anyway, I just wanted to say if you are kind of in the same situation with whatever is going on in your life And you're going up and down, it's completely normal I'm reminding myself that and I'm just letting myself feel the things One thing my therapist told me to do was to actually just schedule time for me to sit down And really feel things in process And I think on one hand it's hard because you have to just sit in the things that have hurt you But also that's the only way to get through it So just some advice that my therapist shared with me If you're someone who tries to kind of avoid the feelings that hurt so much Okay, so this is what I was talking about like now Here's my bucket of tools that I was grabbing when I was over kind of by the bike area And I'm going to now put these away But it's like that would have taken so much longer if I had grabbed a tool over there Come and put it away, grab another tool, come and put it away Like this is going to save me so much time Even though it still has to get done, but I don't know Work smarter, not harder Alright, it's day two That half of the garage is good to go Still need to figure out like which bikes and all that kind of stuff and scooters we're going to keep But I think a lot of them we're not going to keep Which would be nice, it'll give a lot of space and just only be keeping the things that are actually useful All the tools are all set up and organized Now it's this area which I know it looks like a mess But actually a lot of the things like there's some big items, some things that need to get sold Some things that have already actually gone through that just need to get donated I guess They just never got donated Anyway enough to chat, let's get back to work I think I'm going to go ahead and put some of these items like up on Facebook marketplace Just to sell and we'll see how it goes So at this point I have posted the large items and a lot of those are actually gone and that's amazing But I haven't posted the decor yet I'm planning to do that this week If you live in the Phoenix area and you want some of the decor that I'm getting rid of Please message me, I would love to give this to some of you guys I'm not going to be shipping it out just because shipping is so crazy right now And a lot of these pieces are going to be heavier But if you live in the Phoenix area, send me a message I'm hoping I don't run into any spiders And we're still low early for scorpions but fingers crossed so I can do Alright let me know in the comments what is the worst creepy crawly or wild animal that you have where you live For us I feel like definitely scorpions get a very bad rap and they are not great honestly But they really don't tend to bug you too much The worst would be rattlesnakes but I feel those are a lot of places And so I guess far as danger are definitely rattlesnakes But the scorpions are like unique thing here and when you do see them they are gross Alright so we have some items that I'm selling Keeping donate, donate trash Oh, there's all these more that came from These were things that I brought to my nieces, bedroom makeover I'll link that up here for you guys but basically they're items that I just didn't use So I'm guessing I'll keep a lot of these but some I will tear it up So this store up here has bugged me since the day of moving in One side is broken like on the right side over here it was just already broken We don't even know where it is but then the other side because this is like a bulky area Either we can close one side of the door or a lot of times it just sits open like this And I feel like it just looks awful so I decided to take it upon myself to take off the extra broken brackets And then take off the door and I feel like it just feels so much better Now I will say I definitely need to go through all these cabinets I know that will feel really really good but I feel like that would just be very overwhelming On this day because the garage was already in such a disarray So that will be another video but now that everything's clean, everything's kind of staying more clean That will be coming at some point But I was making so so much progress and honestly it took a lot less time than I expected And it's just so motivating I love it Okay these doors right here are ones that we took off from the upstairs bathrooms They were like just blocking off the toilet room area And they honestly it just because like the way those bathrooms are set up It was very annoying to like close it to go in like you had to open it And then kind of like step behind the door to close it It was a whole thing and since the bathroom otherwise already has like its exterior doors These just got taken down but I think honestly we're not gonna put them back up So we don't need to sit there and like store them any longer So these are going to be donated because these can definitely be reused But they're not gonna be sitting in the garage anymore Sorry So I kind of mentioned this in last week's video but as weird as it sounds I'm actually kind of looking forward to moving out I just feel like so much more peace and healing is going to come from that I'm definitely not looking forward to actually moving And I know this transition is not going to feel easy and it's not going to feel good in any way really But I'm just trying to focus on the positives And I know it's been like a difficult thing for me to accept Because I had this plan of my life going so much differently and now here I am I feel like I'm constantly pinching myself in a bad way of like Is this real life like please let me wake up from this and every day I keep waking up here and this is it So life is never what you plan but it'll be something and it'll be okay after time So I'm really trying to hold on to that but anyway enough sappy stuff The garage looks so so good I'm so thankful I came out here and just made this a priority today It feels really great, it's amazing walking into there I know it's really nice for the kids like when they go to get their bikes out They don't have to fight with all the other bikes It's just such a blessing to have this garage clear it out and clean But I hope you guys got a ton of motivation and enjoyed watching Thank you so much for hanging out with me today I'm so grateful for you and I will see you in the next one Bye guys

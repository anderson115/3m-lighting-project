 This garage is a total disaster and because it's so big, I thought it would be easy to organize and to keep tidy, but I'm actually finding the office it is true. Nothing's easy to put away. We're just dropping it in a giant pile. So the goal is to declutter, zone, and create real organizations so that this garage stays tidy all the time. I'm so happy that this is done. It was a lot faster than I thought. You can do the same thing in one weekend. It really comes down to rolling up your sleeve sprens, decluttering, zoning, and getting a great system to get your stuff off the floor and put somewhere.

 I cannot stand looking at this mess in the garage a second longer so I wanted to come up with a more organized system for this space. Perfect thing which was these QR labels that you can attach to the bins. Like is the app allows you to add photos of what's in the bin and notes so you know exactly what you're looking for. I really love that I was able to take photos of what's in the bin and keep them stored in the organization app because now I know exactly what I'm looking for when I scan the code. Cannot lie though this project was definitely a huge undertaking but I am so happy that we are stepping in the right direction for our spring cleaning.

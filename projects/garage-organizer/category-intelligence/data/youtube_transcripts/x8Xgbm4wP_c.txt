I need to know how far down I've got to get to do that or is it a case of just breaking into the feed we've already got from the toilet? So if you look at the depth of that you will sort of know really where you are here because there's obviously going to be a fall or in this case it's going to rise up to get to there. So what work you've got to complete here to do what you've got to do, which ultimately means you can work your lab across the suit, you can work it, you've got to remove this, you've got to get rid of the waste, you've got to put stuff back in, you've got to get your pipe, you've got to get your fittings, so at least that's what you can work out. After having my conversation with a customer, I already know what they want in this room and in this corner, so I this corner where I am, there's going to be a doorway that leads directly from the house, because the other side of the cupboard is a basin and towards it already from the current house. They want to be able to access the downstairs toilet as normal into there, but then they want to access this, which is going to be a bedroom area. So this is what the plan is, we're going to remove our basin from the side of that wall, because that at the moment that drill bit is currently next to the basin, going to put a doorway to the left and side of that oak floor in there, and then roughly where the oak floor in is, we'll have a wall here, like that, comes across here, and then returns into there, and that is then going to be a bedroom area. So again, if you have got to complete that, that's something else to think about because it's going to be a specialist job, I don't do a bedroom, floors and things, so that you need to speak to someone that can do that and ultimately get a price, whether you do with independently yourself, or whether you get the custom at a deal with them directly, so it's not something you have to think of it because what you don't want to do is have to organise that trade, and it all be wrong. But at some point as a builder, you're going to have to really ease with that trade, because they'll need to know things like where the show is going, where the floor drains going, how high or how low the drains got to be to allow them to come in and do what they've got to do, maybe they do all of that, and you just get it prepped, you step away, they do what they've got to do, and then you step back in. If like me, you like to maintain your relationship with a customer, I like to make sure I've got the trades in myself, so I can make sure that the relationship with those trades are also good with the customer, because what you don't want to do is say, oh yeah, I'll get you a sparky, or I'll get you a plumber, when they come, they don't do what they've got to do, or they're not very nice people, or they don't respect the customers. I've had it before, or they don't do a good job, and then expect to be paid, and that causes trouble then between you and them and the customer. So, pick your trades carefully, do some research, and if you can maintain control of the job yourself or you get trades at you now, then it's best to do that. Now, the last one really is that I know this scene has got to be raised, and there isn't a building regulation, which is what they've been told, of course, being told, for a height in a garrist conversion, there isn't one, because there's been an extension above here already, and what they didn't do, because we've all looked at it from upstairs, is what they didn't do, was they didn't take it, the existing, what was a flat roof, feltered, garage ceiling, they didn't do that, they just built over the top, so when you're looking, what we know, looking in here, in there, and I'll show you one minute when I cut this out, we've got the existing flat roof rafters, and then we've got the floor joist above that, going the structure, very, very important, and it could become one A at the start, you need to know what that's made of, in my house, it has bestos, and I know, as a contractor, I can't touch that, it's a specialist job, however, whether it's still the same now, a customer can take it down and bag it up, and get it removed properly, but as a contractor you can't, because you're not registered to do so, seems a bit weird to me, but there you are, I know that is definitely plasterboard, because the customer's told me, and I can also see, from there, that it's plasterboard, so I'm confident, when I start cutting into it, that I'm not going to come across any nasties, I've got hoover, I will be putting a white suit on, and I will be putting a mask on just in case, but I know, and I'm confident that it isn't as bestos, so I'm going to cut a whole lot here, just so I can see what structure I can remove in this area, and I remove all the flat roof rafters, or see if I can or can't, I might not be able to, depends how the building contractor that did all the extension, a structure all this in. Another point that I forgot to mention was the, with guard in the roof, now I'm looking here, it's an integral garage, I'm only going to lift it up a little bit as we talked about, but it may be that if it's not an integral garage, and it's on the side of the house, it may be that you've got to pick the roof up, so you need to discuss with your customer what you can do with that, because whether you have a warm roof, or a cold roof, or a pitch roof, it's all different expenses, so that's certainly worth thinking about, and from the customer point of view, you need to think what you want it to finish, to look like, when it's all done, whether you want it vaulted, whether you want it flat, whether you want to elantinate, whatever, you know, a Velox window, whatever you want to do, that's something you need to think about. Well, I've done my inspection hole, and I've found exactly what I expected to find, and that is the on the side of the old flat roof from the garage, which is the sarking board, which I believe that's what they were called, so someone correct me if I'm not if I'm wrong, as the old sarking board used to put on top of your flat roof rafters before, like that, and then that is the felt that was on top of it, so I've cut it out just to make sure, I was willing to thought it was, and then from this line here, to the on the side of the floor, we've got 420mm, so it could potentially raise this ceiling 420mm, which is really good, with the exception from this point to here, because there was a picture roof on. So what I will potentially look at when all this comes down is it may be where the rafter goes up at an angle like that, I might be able to move the ceiling joist up the rafter, and just give it maybe put a bit of a sloped entrance here, and then try and pick it up to the same height as this one, I'm going to put this plaster wall back there, and then make a crack on, with doing some more work in this garage. Well I hope you've enjoyed that video, and you may have got something from it, if you are a builder that wants to quit for a garage conversion the first time, or whether you are a customer that's thinking about getting a garage conversion, I hope that helps you in some way, if not just to give you a bit of a thought of what you should be thinking about. Thanks for watching, and we will see you on the next one.

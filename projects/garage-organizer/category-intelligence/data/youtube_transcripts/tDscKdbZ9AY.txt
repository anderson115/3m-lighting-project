 Today on Make It With Micah, let's do a garage makeover. Maturing is realizing that an organized garage is the perfect mother's day gift. So when my husband asked me what I wanted for Mother's Day, I sent him my garage mood board and he made it happen. By now, many of y'all know I'm the queen of organization. My kitchen is super organized, as is my bathroom and our bedrooms, but the garage was severely neglected. I needed a space for all the random stuff, like the extension cords, trash bags, light bulbs, as well as our beverage overflow and our beach items. I found this shelving unit for my Kia and the Benzer from Amazon and I love how everything came together. This is just the beginning of what will likely be a long process of getting our entire garage together. I still need to find a good system for all of my husband's long-care items and his car stuff, so be sure to follow along if you want to see the whole process. I also found this neat rack for some of my daughter's outdoor toys, my workout gear, and some stuff for my dog. Just so y'all know, the rest of MegaRosh looks like a hot mess, so I definitely don't have it all together, but I hope you're inspired to find your happy place.

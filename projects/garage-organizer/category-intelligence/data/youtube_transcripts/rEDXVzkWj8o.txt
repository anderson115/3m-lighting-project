 Dude! You know what I learned today? After working on cement all day, you can't spell cement without semen. Oh my god. What the f***? It's one in the morning guys and the freaking roller's giving out on us. Time to install the new cabinets. Here it is guys. The new improved garage. Looks like the cabinets have arrived. Little sneak peak guys. Got a husky 8-piece set. You know what else is? Not me! Alright guys, today it's time to finally start on the floors. It's gonna be a very long process. So please be patient with me. Right now we are headed to Home Depot to gather all of the tools to finish the dream JDM garage. Quick update. If you guys haven't been watching the last few episodes we've spent a total of $600 to $600 on the garage so far. I've decided to keep this transformation low budget. I originally wanted to do marble epoxy floors, but let's be honest. I kinda just want to do it myself and save some money. And a lot of you guys watching at home probably can do any of these things yourself. I've heard nothing but great things about the epoxy floors from Home Depot. Fingers crossed, this is easy. And the garage continues to look amazing. Oh my god. Guys, it's the last one. We're also gonna need the concrete patch and repair. And I don't like the one that this comes with because there's blue in the flake. So I'm gonna do the glacier grey blend. And I don't like the one that this comes with because there's blue in the flake. So I'm gonna do the glacier grey blend. And the most expensive day so far. This is everything that we're gonna need to epoxy the floors. This isn't a YouTube tutorial, right guys? If you guys wanna learn or not, do this. They make better videos. In this video, you guys are gonna watch me. Book up. What not to do by Randy Trump? If you guys are gonna watch me suffer for the next, I don't know how long. We're gonna condense three full base into one video. Let's get to it. Do. Mix it up. I'm gonna open it and make some noise and it's ready. Water in the concrete. You water for three days. You come back from the epoxy floor. Floors are etched. Now we have to wait 24 hours for it to dry. So I read you guys his comments and you guys said that we should tint this? Well, that's what I'm gonna do right now. I'm not any more than to let's do it. One is done. See what it looks like outside. Not bad. Good morning everybody. It has officially been 24 hours. The floors have been degreased. We're ready to get started. The tints are also on. Probably can't tell because the camera will make this area look a little bit more exposed. But look, the lighting in here is now perfect. But let me show you guys how bright it really is outside. This is a 5% tint. So at night we couldn't see anything. Oh my god. Look at that. Crazy. But once we close the doors. There you go. How cool is that? Alright guys, up next we will be using the Restolium concrete patch and repair. Because all of the cracks in this garage has got to go. There we go. Waffles. Not today. It's kind of fun. It is, but. There you go. Waffle. Not today. It's kind of fun huh? It is fun. After eight hours, everything is dry. We literally filled up every single crack. Like literally. I don't think you guys noticed before, but dogs or cats literally ran all over this garage. And there are paw prints everywhere, but everything is sealed. It's a poxy time baby. Last time, seeing it with tragic floors. You know what I learned today? After working on cement all day, you can't spell cement without semen. Oh my god. What the f***? It's one in the morning guys and the freaking roller is giving out on us. We don't have much material left. Nothing is open. It's literally so cold out that the paint is literally sticking. All right now that the floors are done, up next time to install the new cabinets. prendre loves life. Tired arms. Halfrees. Let's go. nunca aah! Yeah! Yeah! Here it is, the new and improved... Oh, damn! The new and improved... Oh, shit! Wrong way again! The new and improved garage... Let me give you guys a quick tour. Right over here we've got the LT4 that we're going to use on a later project. A little tin welder. I'm going to be learning how to use this later. And check out the new epoxy floors. And the new Husky 1234-078-PSET. I did the 8-PSET because I wanted to have a little chair, not have a push, and use the tabletop. And then we're done. Put it back in there. All right. All the tools are put away neatly. We can even charge the Milwaukee batteries and everything in here. And check this out. It's been so many hours, but she's all organized and clean. I have no idea what I want to do with this corner just yet. So I'm just hiding the jacks here. This, but let me take you guys over to this side. And I also went through and cleaned everything in here. Can I see? Boom! All the tools organized. Okay, I'm missing a couple tools. And I'm missing a couple of little things. This is the most unsatisfying. Tain tools, if you're watching this video right now, please send me a brand new set of wrenches. Those are all good at least. And everything else. A lot of the homies we're using the tools throughout the years and myself included. And we just lost them. Shout out Tain tools. Shout out Tain tools. And start 20. Just put it together. And right over here, detailing car is done. We'll be able to push this everywhere and it can be used as a little tool cart as well. I honestly have not figured out what I wanted to do with this side just yet. But that is it. What do you guys think about the new and improved garage? Honestly, I'm so glad that we went with this color epoxy floors. It reflects the light very well. And I'm actually glad that we have a whole bunch of like red throughout the entire garage. We got a nice little black and red and gray theme going. What is that the Nismo color type? They are the Nismo colors. I know my street. Wow, you're becoming a card reader. No, just your girl. Oh!

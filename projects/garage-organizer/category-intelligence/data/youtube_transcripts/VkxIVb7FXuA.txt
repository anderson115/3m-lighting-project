 You guys, I have some exciting news. We are starting a new home project. And is this a safe space because this garage is looking really crazy. I am determined to turn this garage into a home gym. I wanted to be a stedda and for it to essentially not look like a garage at all, we're doing a full transformation. And now that we've decluttered as much as we could, we rented a storage unit and rented a U-Haul so that we could transfer everything over. Obviously, you guys know by now that my job is to find the best home decor for y'all, but that also means I have a ton of decor. Most of the stuff that we're putting in storage is holiday decor, either Christmas or fall, that I just don't need on a regular basis. So it's going to be perfect to house it in storage. And you guys shout out to Rob because we were doing this during a heat wave and it was so difficult, we were literally sweating. I swear next time I need to choose an easier home project that we can complete indoors. So the storage unit that we ended up renting is a 10 by 15 size and it ended up being perfect for all of our decor. And we tried to keep as much of it organized as we could, putting Christmas on one side, fall on the other, and extra stuff kind of in that back corner. So technically, we're going to have to do this all over again right before Christmas when I want to decorate, but we'll do with that later. And this is what our garage is currently looking like, still a lot going on and a long way to go.

 This garage space was unusable. This is my sister in-bother in-laws house and I've been doing a lot of projects here lately, so I knew it was time for a makeover. We cleared out all the tools and clutter. My brother Cyril and I took down all the old shelving, pegboard, and serilded most of the demo for this old workmen. The shelves were super bowed and it just did not provide enough storage. So our new plan is to paint the walls white, add three new cabinets with a ton of storage, a new countertop, and lots of hanging storage. I patched the walls, serild sanded, and we painted it in a creamy white. Now I'm adding some wood braces here because the concrete foundation at the bottom will push the cabinet out. So adding braces will give us something that we can screw the cabinets into. We screwed into the studs and I'd say that's pretty sick. After what felt like years of shimming, we got the cabinets level, screwed them together through the face frames and to the walls, through the back. I wanted to do a pre-fab laminate countertop, but the extra depth from the concrete foundation makes that complicated. So we're just using this basic laminate sheet for each room, down the side, out of the toe kick, secure the countertop down, and trim the edges with simple one by two. We touched up the nail holes and seams, and just look at this organization. There is so much storage vertical and hidden. I cannot tell you how much more excited I am to come out here and do project. Stay tuned to see when I make out here.

 This is hands down my husband's most impressive project. We have four boys and our garage needed some major organization. We started by moving all these bins to ceiling storage racks, which freed up an entire wall. I knew exactly what I wanted, storage lockers, but nothing in stores came close, so my husband got to work building it himself. I told him to make them practical, look good, and built to survive our boys. He more than delivered. He even made custom drawers for shoes, so it will hide all the clutter. After staining and sealing, he added hooks for backpacks and helmets. He found the perfect bins to store gloves and hats, and he even made a cubby for our snowboard boots and helmets. The bench is the ideal height for the boys to sit and put on their shoes and reach their hooks. It perfectly organizes all our chaos. I love it so much, my husband is the best.

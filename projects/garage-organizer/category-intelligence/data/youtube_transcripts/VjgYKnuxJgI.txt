 Garage storage and organization will take your shop to the next level. Should I keep it or let it go? This is the RIOB Link Storage System. There's tons of others, a couple I'll tell you about, but this is Link. This has different ways to mount different tools. First off, it's a rail system. You just mount those to your wall and then you buy the accessories, like this battery mount accessory for the 40 volt or even the 18 volt. You can also get tool holders like you see here. I have all of our tools very easily accessible. It actually mounts very uniquely or geniusly into the battery slot. There's also small parts organization that you can get and this fantastic folding work table so that it doesn't take up much space. There's also this drill charging station or drill holding station. I've got several different tools piled in there. It really helps me keep those inside and organized. Tell you, RIOB knocked it out of the part, but they're not the only ones. But I've also included Milwaukee Packout and I have several Milwaukee tools so I wanted to be able to mount those as well. I have wall mounts for different packout boxes. I have some on the floor. We also have battery mounts for the M18 and the M12 line. And then I also have 3D printed some of these inserts to hold some of my favorite tools to keep them protected. But let me know on the RIOB in the Milwaukee. Would you keep it or let it go? Comment, keep it go.

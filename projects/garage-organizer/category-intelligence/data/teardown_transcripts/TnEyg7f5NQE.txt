 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. I want to talk about something pretty quick. You've heard us talk about before how we love these magnet hooks that we use on every single sailing. However, in this room, we're pretty excited to see that somebody left some command hooks and in our in-laws room, somebody left their own magnet hooks. So I just want to give you a quick comparison of them. We shouldn't take too long. So this is my daughter's backpack. This has a few of her things in it. These command hooks seem to hold up pretty well. This is the hook we normally use. And then here's the other hook. So you can tell this hook is significantly stronger. You almost have to twist it 90 degrees. You almost have to twist it 90 degrees to get it off the wall. These, I don't know how happy roll cravings going to be that you're sticking stuff from that leader of their wall or temporarily permanent. However, you want to look at it. But it's definitely a huge difference between the cheap magnets and the stronger ones. So we definitely recommend getting the larger magnets on Amazon. And if you want, we'll actually put a link in the video to these. So you can see the difference. I mean, the magnet size on these is a drastic difference. So that's why it's important to spend the little bit of extra money for a nice strong hook. You can hear that one grab. That one barely clicks. So this is pretty neat. You just show you real quick what these look like. You can kind of see them side by side. So there's just a quick little video on different ways to hang stuff on the wall. We love these large hooks. Like I said, we'll put a link up. They're awesome.

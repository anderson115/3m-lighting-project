 Okay, we've got these garage hooks and you can see they are made for tools and I'm going to show you a couple of other things that I'm doing with it as well but this shovel here fits really well so get in the neck on there any further down it actually is a little bit too thick so it is designed for your everyday tools but it also works really well so we've got our ladder hanging up here and everything is still getting set up but for right now we are trying to fill out the wall I do have some more that I'm going to be adding on there they are very sturdy just take these out so you can see with the mount on here whether you've got a drywall like this or where you're at it does come with a necessary tool kit or the hardware to make sure and get that installed so they are very strong I there is a little bit of me that kind of wishes there were some a little bit wider but they do have a little bit of give to them on both directions so if you do need to squeeze something in there hold something up there but it does kind of fit the purpose you can see with the ladder I get in it on there is really easy on the other side I actually have a workout area in my gym actually needed a place to kind of hang my gloves so he's actually work really well for me to hang these these are these smaller ones so just kind of getting them on there does give me a little bit of opportunity you can see just screwed right on there really easy to put on there so I've got a lot of wall space still left and I'm trying to figure out exactly what I'm going to put on there where I'm going to put that there were a decent amount in here so just trying to make sure I find what needs to be necessary where to put them there are some large ones as well which we haven't taken others out the majority of them are a little bit small but if I'm being honest with you the small ones are probably going to get the job done a lot more than some of the other ones but if you do have more tools like this you can see that it does fit very well even on the medium size and makes things super easy and gets things off the floor which is where everything I had and clean things up real nice

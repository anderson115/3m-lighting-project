 Drywall anchors. We've had other people in another our past videos ask questions in the comments concerning 5-8s drywall I've never tested anchors in 5-8s drywall and this we're gonna test in the ceiling amount of a piece of 5-8s drywall on our infamous wall here We've tested drywall we tested anchors and we've disproved a few things and if you're not sure what I'm talking about go back and watch some of our easy patch California patches whatever watch those videos you can see what I'm talking about. Anyway so I put a piece of 5-8s drywall up here and we got the anchors that we carry on our trucks we got four we've got these aluminum anchors right here made by easy anchor used a bunch of these hundreds of not thousands I don't have a part number for that one oh but I know it's made by easy anchor we got a fairly fairly large box oh here we go we got a toddler brand here this is a pretty sweet anchor right here part number 50 125 a couple things I really like about this anchor right here is I like how sharp the knives are what I'm talking about the knives the cutting portion that screws into the sheet rock and then as the screw is ran in here it splits this right and wies out so I was talking about those knives what I've experienced with this here it is when you run it into the sheet rock it does not bulge because mind you you don't need to to drill with this you just run it in there with the screw so this is definitely a bonus and we've started carrying these in pretty pretty nice anchor there here's another easy anchor no this would be considered a toggle and part number 25 320 this guy right here is a little bit different to where if you have something thick it can handle much thicker than a half inch so if you got a couple sheets of drywall doubled up or maybe something that it's let me see how far would it go yeah you could do two sheets of dry you could do an inch of drywall right there in this one we got a toddler a toggle here's a big boy right here it takes a half inch little bit right there part number 55 and 75 so there's four anchors that pretty much does everything that we need we do have a couple of course we carry these here but I'm not going to test them hey if you don't know yet this is Darren with Confidome Solutions licensed general contractor builder modeler North Carolina now let's get on to testing these anchors okay so we're starting on this one right here it's the easy anchor just aluminum twist twist an anchor okay I'm going to unload it that way you guys can see it's at zero took the weight of the binder and that off all right so technically this anchor is already holding four pounds whatever all right slowly go down on it go faster little faster okay zeroed up okay yep nope you got to keep it the okay that made it considerably higher than I thought it would we got this toddler right here we're going to be moving on too let me unload the scale see we're at zero all right see what it does okay hold on slow down we're at already up at 90 nice nice nice so that hit 90 pounds before it really started to move so that's what that looks like coming to the drywall all right all right so round two for this right here it's unloaded it for him all right good deal here we go okay okay so he's going to finish pulling up through it's pretty much pretty much all the way through all right a little bit about our channel I'm not a handyman nor am I tips and tricks person we're professional remodellers we created this channel to share our day-to-day experiences and our jobs that we think you might find interesting whether it's dealing with clients materials what the best tools out there and hardware right here you're like well if you're not tips and tricks why you testing hardware this benefits us as much as it does you guys so with this um five-ease testing drywall right here if I do have a client that asks us to hang such and such and we do have to go off the drywall we we can't get in there to run on to buy to brace it off I can be confident hey that toggle of toddler whatever we'll hold X amount of weight I got the data now so that's why this channel exists and hopefully you guys will hit that subscribe button come back and check us out more and since we got about eight pounds okay let's do it wow here we go here's our second one of these right here you ready let me unload it okay here we go that's not 180 yeah all right so we're moving on this to this right here the big boy toddler made by it's a toggle made by toddler you unload it close enough for what we're doing okay here we go here's the second one of these load it there we go 200 pounds well I think I already made a conclusion about a couple times and so let's look at the tear out on this drywall this is an easy anchor represented by these two holes here we're going on to a toddler anchor up here here's a easy anchor but it's actually a toggle style anchor and here's a toddler and it's a the type of anchor is toggle but these two right here final thoughts on this you know I like this right here if you've watched any of my videos this easy anchor aluminum anchor we've used these for years works great for screwing into the sides apply wood one by board we will never get rid of this however going into 5-8 sheet rock up there I think there's something better and it would be this right here made by toddler this plastic toddler it consistently showed 35 pounds heavier a rating than this and I really like how it wise out now all that being said easy anchor makes their version of this right here but I don't like the the design of it and that's why we don't carry it now moving on past those two screwing types we got this toggle style made by easy anchor and I was really impressed by its load rating what we just showed right here I did not expect it to carry that much yeah I was really impressed of course if you got to have the absolute most amount of load carrying definitely go with this bar style of toddler toggle style well that's a tongue twister right there but all right so here we go if I were to pick two winners it would definitely be these two guys right here I'm really impressed with that screwing style made by toddler and then these this easy anchor toggle style anchor both these are excellent anchors but we will continue to carry all four of these because different types of materials require different types of anchors and if you're going to be the top of your trade you got to use top line materials all right hit that subscribe button notification leave comment and tell me what I missed

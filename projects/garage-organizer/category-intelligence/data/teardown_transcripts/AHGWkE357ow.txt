 I'm going to interview your tired of doing this. Every time you want to get that saw out of the bottom box. So here's the solution. Get rid of this. Grab yourself a dolly. Take that cabinet of yours off the wall. Throw it on the bottom dolly. And grab yourself a set of drawers. We're almost there. Organizers. Reciprocating saws. Outslating tools. Whatever else you need for the job. And then we go like this. Take them saws. Whatever else you have in the bottom box. Throw them inside. No more box unstacking. Let me know if there's something you're already doing.

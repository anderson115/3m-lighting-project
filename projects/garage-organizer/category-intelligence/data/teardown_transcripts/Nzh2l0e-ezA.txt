 I have two of these monster racks. They are 4 feet wide by 8 feet long. And you can see that they do a phenomenal job of holding a bunch of storage in the garage. You can only imagine what the garage would look like if all of this was on the floor, if it was on the shelf. So it just alleviates so much room. We've got a home gym going on because of the storage that has been alleviated, which is awesome. I love the color. I also love the underneath here. You have reinforced rods that run through to be able to boost everything up. It can hold a ton of weight. I like how customizable it is, both on the studs portion and also from the vertical hanging. You can see that there's a bunch of holes to choose from. You can go short or you can go long. You can go in any direction. These things are super easy to use, easy to put together, and I hope that you like them.

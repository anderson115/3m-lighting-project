 MUSIC Alright. So assessing the situation, are they breathing? No, Rose. They are not breathing. And they have no arms or legs. No, that's not part of it. Where are they? You know what? If we come across somebody with no arms or legs, do we bother resuscitating them? I mean, what kind of quality of life do we have there? I would want to live with no legs. How about no arms? No arms or legs is basically how you exist right now, Kevin. You don't do anything. Alright, well let's get back to it, because you're losing them. Okay, too fast. Everyone, we need to pump in a pace of 100 beats per minute. Oh, okay. That's hard to keep track. How many is that per hour? How's that gonna help you? I will divide and then count to it. What? Okay, well, a good trick is to pump to the tune of staying alive by the Bee Gees. Do you know this song? Yes, yes. I do. I love this song. First I was afraid. I was petrified. No, it's uh uh uh uh uh uh. Stay in a light, stay in a light. Okay, just a minute. You were in the parking lot earlier. That's how I know you. Uh uh uh uh uh. Stay in a light, stay in a light. Uh uh uh uh uh. Stay in a light, stay in a light. Uh uh uh. You can't tell by the way I used my walk. I'm a woman's band, I'm tied to cow. Where's it live, women want been kicked around since I was born? Where's all right, it's okay. You can't live the other way. You can't live the other way. You can't live the other way. Get it, get it, get it. I'm an imin, imin, imin, imin, imin, imin. Stay in a light, stay in a light. Okay, you didn't maintain 100 beats per minutes. And the ambulance didn't arrive because nobody called 911. So you lost him. Okay, he's dead. Anyone know what we do next? Anybody? Rose? I have no idea. Anyone else? We bury him. Wrong. We're gonna run her card. If he has one, we only have minutes to harvest. He has to wallet, I'd check. He is an organ donor. He is. Yeah. Give me some ice in a styrofoam bucket. Here we go. Oh my God! Why? Somebody help me. I'm a boy. I'm a boy. We search for the organs. Where's the heart? The brush is hard. I'm not feeling well, I need to sit on it. I'm scared. You should have let it stay. Hey, brush please. Are you okay? No! Oh my God. You're dead. You're dead. Oh my God. Can you tell me why you had to cut the face off the dummy? I didn't think it was very realistic in the movie, and it turns out. It's pretty realistic. We had to pay for it. It cost us $3,500. $5,300 for a dummy? Wow. Okay, look. David, this is why we have training. We start with the dummy, and we learn from our mistakes. And now Dwight knows not to cut the face off of a real person.

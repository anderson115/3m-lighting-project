 Alright, to take a look at the O'Leaver Magnet, black magnetic hooks. Cool, so I actually came with some straps, so if you got like long extension cord or something like that, you can strap that guy up. That's nice. Nice little touch. See here we got our magnets, you can see we already got our studs attached. On this one we've got all of our hardware. You can see these rings right here, so those are these strong magnets that are going to be holding this onto the wall. I do like that it comes with washers and lock washers with our nuts. And here's our hook, see it is rubber coated, so you have to worry about scratching up anything that we're going to be hanging on top of it. So I'm just going to take the magnet, I'm going to drop it through the top hole, washer, lock washer and nut. Yeah, so that's on there nice and strong. So there we go, let's go ahead and test these guys out. So here we got four of them, and see they hold up these well and you know I'm just no problem. One of the cool things about it, you can just kind of move it around wherever you need it. So you have to drill holes, you just kind of place it wherever you want. So yeah, here's some great hooks.

 These hooks are strong and they are very easy to install. I took before and after pictures of my garage. Sadly the pictures really don't do justice to how much floor space these hooks created. With these hooks, I compressed what tools I already had hanging and moved lots of assorted equipment tools off of the floor and onto hooks. If you need more garage floor space, remember to think in three dimensions. Love these hooks. I've used seven in this installation. Two X4 onto open bar brackets and will use the rest to handle some other yard equipment and a 12 ladder. Especially love the zigzag hooks. There are four brooms and four rakes on these two. I wish I'd done it sooner. Add some orange buckets from a large retail hardware chain and I'm going to have one stylishly organized garage. We recently bought a new shed and I've been slowly finding homes for everything. A few things like some tools and ladders and such still need to get off the ground out of the way. These storage hooks are just the ticket to getting more of my stuff organized. They are sturdy, well built and I appreciate the orange protective covering that both saves items from being scratched and also make for better visibility in low light. They come with screws and hardware for both wood and shithra. Got my ladder put up today. Garden tools are next. I'm not OCD but I've learned the value of having everything organized to make life easy when you need to get something. These hooks are going to be another big step towards harmony and organization in my workspace if anything changes I'll come back to update. Happy shopping pros. Very well made come with a good drywall and good solid rubber on the hooks well-designed cons. Expected the way they want to be a bit longer. You can fit about three tools if they nest well.

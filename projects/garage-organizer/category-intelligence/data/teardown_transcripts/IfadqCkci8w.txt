 Here's how to easily self pop crack mobilize whatever you want to call it your hip at home. Start seated with very good upright posture. Take the painful side, bring that leg up, rest your ankle over your other side's knee. So when you look down it should look like a figure four. I'm going to take the hand on the painful side and slowly press down on my knee until I feel a deep but comfortable stretch into that painful hip. From there I'm going to lean forward through my hips through my waist. We don't want to round the back. Go forward as much as you can. We're going to take this one to the next level by then putting our arms out in front of us kind of like a genie position and then twisting and rotating away from the painful side. You might get a sudden pop or release with this one but do not try to force it. Instead hold it comfortably for about 15 to 20 seconds. You're just going to relax and then stretch into it more on the next repetition. Try to do that three to five times and when you're done on one side, switch to the other to keep them both in balance.

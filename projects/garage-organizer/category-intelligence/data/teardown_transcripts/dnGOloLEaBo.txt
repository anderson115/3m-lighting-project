 This is if these 30-pound magnetic hooks are any good or if they're crap, I could tell you for sure. They are pretty stout. I don't know if they're going to hold 30 pounds or not. I am sure that I've made a mistake. I came up with this cool plan to do a video for you. Install some lights up there. And I think my lights weigh a little too much for the amount of hardware that I have to attach these to.

 Anybody got a pocket knife I can sharpen three? Yes, okay. No charge, but you got to decide. All right, let's look. Oh no, it's one of these. Oh, oh yeah. Oh no! Yeah. Little kids don't look at that. That means I can't look. So gently, just like this, this is reprofiling. Taking them bumps off the side of the knife, and I already feel that I would not do this. Again. Okay. Oh, dude, I want one. That way, don't lay down like that. Walk on yet. Okay.

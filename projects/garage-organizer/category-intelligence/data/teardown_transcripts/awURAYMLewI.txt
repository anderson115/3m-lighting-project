 So I ruined my skin with this beauty hack and here's how. As a hairy Latina, I got curious and I thought, hey, why don't I just shave my face? You did a dumb before. Why not? Why not? Well, it didn't work for me. You see, this technique known as derma planning left my skin glowing and amazing, but then, hell, burglous. It's all bumpy, it hurts, it's hot. After plenty of skin treatments, I was finally able to get my skin in a good condition, but more all the story, leave it to the professionals and don't try every beauty hack you see online.

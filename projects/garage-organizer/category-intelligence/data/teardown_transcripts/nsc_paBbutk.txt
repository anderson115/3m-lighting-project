 I'm going to organize my wardrobe with me with the help of these cool little magnets from AMF Magnetics. These guys come in a wide range of strengths that hold all the way up to 164 kilos. If it's the day, I decided to go for the 5.5, 9 and 22 kilo pull force and they were plenty strong. These attach really easily to this meta hanger that's in my wardrobe and they did exactly what I wanted them to do. I'm actually really happy with how this turned out and it just looks so much neater. If you want to get your hands on some of your own hook magnets, head over to bangnet.com.au.

 These utility hooks are excellent, they are super strong, and have a thick coating that prevents scratches. Also, the hooks come with all of the mounting hardware you will need, including hardware for mounting on wood, plaster, brick, and concrete, the different shapes and sizes ensure that you will have what you need to get the job done. I will definitely be buying more ovbies in the future. Built a new shed, needed some hooks and hangers, saw the Spagarrage hooks and hangers on Amazon. Package arrived on time and in good shape. Lots and lots of extra hardware. These babies are stout and easy to mount, hang a ton of stuff, good coating so they don't scratch stuff up. Beefy, heck yeah, buy em. Great selection of sturdy hooks, perfect for garage organization. All the hardware that you'll need, regardless of installation location. Mounting plates are fixed, not injures in some other similar items, and triple riveted. So far, I've hung up a pair of golf bags for much less than dedicated golf bag solutions. Durable hooks that will hold most lawn care and garden tools. I was impressed in the initial quality of these hooks, they have some weight to them and are well built. The ones I purchased are matte black in color with a texture matte blue rubber coating on the actual hook part. I took a picture of the hooks alone because I'm sure you can imagine a rake or shovel hanging from it. The texture finish on the hooks help prevent scratches and also adds an additional grip to help hold the tools. The specific kit I bought comes with an assortment of 12 different hooks and also includes mounting hardware for both hard and soft surfaces with plactic anchors. Everything that you would need to hand these hooks is included in the kit aside from a drill and screw driver.

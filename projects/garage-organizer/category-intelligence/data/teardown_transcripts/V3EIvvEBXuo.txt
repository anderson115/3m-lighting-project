 This is a test of a magnetics magnet's pull strength. What we have here is one of our retrieval magnets and it's attached to an iron block, which is attached to this force meter. This meter is going to record the peak tension that is being put on this block here from the magnet. I'm going to move this lever here and pull the magnet away from the block and measure that tension. So that took 61 pounds of force to separate the two. You can see that the magnet and the block are separated.

 Step 1. Slowly slide your stud finder horizontally across the wall. Mark the spot with a pencil on where you find the edges of your stud. Step 2. Locate the center of the stud where you want to place your hook. Mark the screw holes. Step 3. Align the hook and drive the screws into the stud using a screwdriver or drill. Make note. You will not need anchors if your wall is made of wood. Make sure not to over tighten screws or they will loose strength.

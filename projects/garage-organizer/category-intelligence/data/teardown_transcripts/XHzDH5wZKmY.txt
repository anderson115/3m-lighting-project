 The time has arrived. Finally. It's here. It's here. Time to do the test. Thomas. He's nervous. Are you nervous? We got snap-on wrenches over here. Icon wrenches over here. 13 millimeter. 13 millimeter. That's the icon. Here's a snap-on. One of them is going to slip and we'll see it on there. Ladies and gentlemen, the snap-on wrench just slipped. I did not expect this. No, I'm I'm being dead serious. You said that with a snap-on deal you could flip it over even on the rounded one in the snap-on would hold. So let's put the icon on the rounded one and see if it'll hold the rounded one because that's how you said the snap-ons would do, right? Oh my gosh. Are you kidding me right now? What are you laughing?

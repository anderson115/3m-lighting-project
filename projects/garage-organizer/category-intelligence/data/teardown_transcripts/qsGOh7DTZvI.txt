 How to tell if your carbon fiber road bike has a crack in it. First, locate what you think is a crack. I think that's a crack. Then what you're going to want to do is get yourself a coin. Someone to a nickel, a quarter a dime, or any kind of other currency that you want. Carbon fiber gives off a nice high-pitched tone when you hit it with something. Has to a coin. Now you're going to take that coin and go ahead and tap it on the crack itself. You first tap around it. Now we tap right on top of the crack. How you can tell it does not make the same noise as if it was structurally sound. Now you can check a home to see if you have a crack on your frame or if it's just a paint malfunction instead of the actual crack itself. Thanks.

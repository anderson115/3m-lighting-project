 So we're on cruise ship and we use these hooks. I will tell you when you get them, they come into pieces like this. So you will have to kind of screw these together here. It's pretty simple to screw that and then you're ready to go. So I want a cruise ship. All of the walls even the ceiling is metal. So you can just take these magnets and put them pretty much anywhere. It works great for hanging the laying there, John. Even jacket you can hang on. Now we'll say if it's something that is super heavy, it can slide down the wall. So yeah, there's... You may wouldn't want a couple of them to hold something like that. But it works great for hanging jackets or whatever. Like I said, it also works with the ceiling.

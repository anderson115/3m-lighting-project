 Let me show you exactly how I turned this boring metal pole on my office into a coat rack with the help of these Nifty little hook magnets from AMF Magnetics. It set up with super quick knees and you all had to do is attach the magnets to the pole and hang out my gear. I got three different strengths ranging from 5 to 22 kilos and they all work perfectly. God, just look how good that looks. I can't recommend these enough. Get yours today at magnet.com.au

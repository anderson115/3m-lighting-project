 Step 1. Decide where you want to place your garage hook. Step 2. Mark the top and bottom holes with a pencil. Step 3. Align your drywall anchor with the mark and gently hammer it in, about one-third of the way. Step 4. Use a Phillips screwdriver to gently push the anchors in. Step 5. Once the anchors are in, align the holes on the hook with the anchors and use screwdriver to insert the screws through the hooks holes. Step 6. Repeat the process for the second hole. Tighten everything. Finally, ensure the hook is firmly attached and stable.

 Hello everybody, I wanted to show you very quickly the versatility of these hooks. You'll see that I put that version in the wall as well as that version as well as that one. And it is quite amazing what these things can hold both in drywall or if you are work to put this into some studs out in the garage. And I love these hooks look they're rubberized like this. They also do come with quite a bit of hardware so in this particular instance I did needed to bulk it up with one more screw as you can see. But so far it can hold a lot of weight. I did have to bend this one open just a little bit in order to fit that tripod in there but it fits perfectly. Highly recommended 5 out of 5 stars get in these hooks and get stuff off the ground using that vertical space wind story.

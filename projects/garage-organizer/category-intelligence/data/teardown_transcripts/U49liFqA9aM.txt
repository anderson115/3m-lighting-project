 This is a garage storage organizer that was gifted to me by this company for a view. And in this case it came in really handy because as you'll see the corner of my garage here has got all kinds of tools to stacked up against the wall. And I'd like to get this little cleaned up and organized. I'll probably come a little lower. There's no real need to be that high. So about this height right here. So I got my bubble in the middle and I'm going to mark a line there. So now what I'm going to do is just mark these holes. This is the part I really like. The accessories I need it comes with it. So I've got to make sure that this little lip goes on the top. That's where the hooks all hook in. You can try the first couple. There we go. What a beautiful thing. I'll do the others quickly and we'll see what it looks like. All right, so I have the channel up and looks good. I'm going to hook these up. What I really like about these also is just the quality of the materials. I mean they are nice and thick. There's a nice rubber coating on this section. So the whole look and feel of this is very nice. There we go. All right, let's clean this up. There we go. That took just a few minutes. I think it looks wonderful and I know my wife is going to be very happy about this.

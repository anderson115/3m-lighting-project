 Whenever we go on a cruise, we love using these magnetic hooks. We use them outside for our door, but we also use it inside too because the walls are magnetic. And it's great to hold decorations, lanyards, as well as sunglasses, your hats, and so much more. It really comes in handy. And we even put our travel summary there so everybody knows exactly what's going on each and every day. And it is just so ideal and they're quite strong as well. Definitely recommend picking up some when you are traveling on a cruise ship. Definitely one of our must-habs. Thanks for watching and hope you found this video helpful. Happy cruising!

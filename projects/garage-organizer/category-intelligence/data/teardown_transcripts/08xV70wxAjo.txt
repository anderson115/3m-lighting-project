The Ultimate UG22102B is a 10 piece package with a bamboo worktop and big storage cabinets to help you declutter rapidly. It comes with full extension ball bearing drawer slides that smoothly glide when you open or close the drawers. The drawers have a secure lock system to ensure the security of your items. This cabinet storage is among the best we've used since its adjustable hinges produce less noise. Also, this model comes with an upgraded bamboo worktop. Thanks to its modular design, this product was our best cabinet storage system since it allows for unlimited expanding options. This storage system comes with a wire management system, particularly on the top cabinets, making it easy to access power outlets. It also has a wall mounting cleat that offers several installation options on the base cabinets. At number four, wall control 30WGL200GVB Pegboard Tool Organizer. If you don't need to reorganize your entire garage and probably looking for the best rail garage storage system since it's easy to install, take a look at this pegboard from wall control which is a great organizational tool. The pegboard is constructed from galvanized steel, making it significantly stronger and capable of bearing more weight than traditional pegboards. Plus, mounting it onto the wall is simple, straightforward, and fast with the included hardware. The pegboard itself comes with an array of shelving, bins, and hooks that allow you to begin the organization process, and it's easy to purchase additional organizers later. The pegboard is designed with slots for both traditional 1.25 inch peg hole devices as well as slotted openings to fit accessories sold by wall control. Users noted that the included accessories were not particularly helpful for complex organizational schemes and encouraged purchasing the boards alone and only the accessories you need afterwards. Since the pegboard is made of steel, you can also attach magnets to it to customize beyond the peg holes themselves. At number 3, FLEXIMO UNTS 4x8 overhead garage storage rack. If you keep a lot of items in your garage that you rarely need to access, this overhead storage rack from flex amounts is one of the best ways to use the space between your head and the ceiling that it otherwise wasted. The mount is constructed of heavy duty steel and can hold up to 550 pounds, so you won't have to worry that the system will come crashing down. Although the system takes some work to install since it requires a ladder, and ideally a helping hand, once it is up it virtually never needs to be adjusted. One rack is 8 feet long and 4 feet wide, which leaves a huge footprint for holding boxes. Plus, the rack hangs down up to 40 inches from the ceiling, which offers enough clearance to load tall boxes or multiple boxes stacked on top of one another. If you are looking for the best bike garage storage system, there is another advantage to the FLEXIMOUNTS system. Hooks can be added on around the edges of the wire platform after market, allowing you to hang things like bikes, skis, and yard tools from the rack. At number 2, FLEXIMOUNTS2PAC floating shelves. This set of shelving combines flex amounts ingenuity with the usefulness of traditional wall shelving. What sets these shelves apart is the whopping 400 pound weight capacity, which means that you'll be able to stack extremely heavy objects onto these shelves without worrying. Whether it's a toolbox, an air compressor, or a garage fan, this storage system will handle it all. The shelves only jet out from the wall by 2 feet, however, which may limit the size of objects that you can put on these shelves. Because the shelves are sold as a two-pack rather than as a single long shelf, it is possible to place these shelves either side by side, stacked above one another, or around completely different parts of the garage. This flexibility also means that you can customize how high off the ground you want to place the shelves, and how much clearance you want to leave between the shelves and the ceiling. At number 1, PREPACTS Elite Storage Cabinet. Although it is one of the simpler and more traditional garage storage systems in our roundup, don't underestimate this storage cabinet from PREPAC. The cabinet is a whopping 32 inches wide and 65 inches tall, so it leaves plenty of space to store items. The cabinet only has three shelves, but a nice feature is that two of them can be adjusted in height so that you can customize how you stack items on the shelves. The cabinet itself is made of composite wood, while all of the hinges and handles are made of metal. The cabinet is relatively stylish, and so would fit in well with a furnished garage or even a basement. Since the design is relatively simple and the construction is strong, this cabinet is also very durable and requires very little assembly.

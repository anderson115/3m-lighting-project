 Just want to talk real quick about the iMillet broom and mop holder. It also has six hooks on it. So you have five holders for things that have poles like mops, brooms, sweepers, things along those lines. And then it has six hooks that you can hook things onto as well. So you can see that pretty much we have some of our things like our brooms and our duster here. And then over on this side we have more of our dog supplies, some bags and things of that sort of nature. I wanted to give like a real world look of of what we actually have on this here. And the important thing to note here is that it mounts really well. There's just some screws up here on top so you can put those straight into the wall, try to get them into studs, but you can use molly bolts if you need to. So I wanted to give you a quick tip on how to actually use this. A lot of people complain about it because they say they can't get it in by pushing. In actuality you're not supposed to push it in. What you're supposed to do is this ball here will rotate down. It doesn't push in. It rotates up and down. And when it gets locked in there, you know, when the brooms tries to fall, the ball goes down and it locks it into place with the friction. So what you want to do is either a lift it up, put it in, then you can kind of get into that pushing motion. You need to give it a little bit of a start. Otherwise you're just fighting it. Or the way that I typically do it is I just slide the broom up. So you can just sit here, slide the broom straight up, and you can see how easy that was. There's no difficulty to it. Makes it a great way to organize, you know, your mobs and brooms of that manner. And it's really helped to keep our garage clean. We don't have things falling over anymore. So if this is something that you're looking for, I do highly recommend it. If you found this video helpful, go ahead and give it a like. Comment if you have any questions about it.

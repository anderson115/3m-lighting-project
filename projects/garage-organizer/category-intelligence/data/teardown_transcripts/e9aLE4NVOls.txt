 I'm a hack guy. Couldn't you tell? And I needed a very sleek way to not only organize my hats, but also to display some of my cooler ones. I didn't really like anything that would hang on my door, anything that was big. And it came across these awesome hooks that come with this strong adhesive. They're very simple. The adhesive part goes against the wall. You just sort of hang the back of the hat and the hat goes on like that. There's 16 of them that come in a box. I haven't used all of them. You can see here I have a bunch of extras. As I was initially looking for some hats storage, I didn't necessarily know I wanted to display my hats. And I saw how other people were using them. Then I started looking at my home office and I thought, wow, that would be really neat to hang my hats in this particular corner. Now they all hang and I was able to sort of stagger them on the wall to kind of give a nice cool aesthetic. The adhesive is extremely strong. I put it on over a year and a half, two years ago and they have not fallen off. I know hats aren't a lot of weight, but you know, the adhesive sticks. You don't have to worry about it. And I really like the fact that they're just clear, right? So when you see the hats up against the wall, all you see is the hat. You don't see any sort of big plastic piece to it. Anything sticking out. It's just the hat on the wall. Overall, if you're looking for a unique and creative way to hang your hats, I definitely recommend these simple little clear hooks. Boxes 16 should be able to display your hats in a cool and organized way.

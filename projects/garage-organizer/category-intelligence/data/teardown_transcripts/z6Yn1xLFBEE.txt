 Hey everyone, today I'm going to give you my honest review on this 12 pack of garage hooks. Now, depending on the material in which you're mounting these two, whether that be plaster, wood or brick, they can hold up to 77 pounds. You do receive an array of hooks and depending on what you're hanging up and how far it is from the wall, will determine which hook you use. Now, the first thing that I decided to hang up was these cornhole boards, and they are pretty heavy, so we went with the medium-sized hook. Installation is fairly simple. The instructions are really well detailed, and hanging up my cornholes or it's was a breeze. They look really good and they feel very secure. These are very heavy duty, and I also love that they have the rubber coating on them, so you're not going to scratch anything. Looking around at my garage, I did find a lot of things that I could hang up, including these boards, the bag in which I have all of the bags, maybe be stroller, boachyball, I have a ladder on one, and some tools. If you are looking for some heavy duty hooks that are easy to install, I would highly recommend these ones.

 So one of the things I really like about this is this has the ability to connect these together to make it a much longer light and you can fold the arms out here and connect them to something magnetic. So we'll do a couple of tests to show you how to do that. There also are hooks right here so if you disconnect it and you want to hook it to something you have a full 360 degree ability there same thing on this side as well.

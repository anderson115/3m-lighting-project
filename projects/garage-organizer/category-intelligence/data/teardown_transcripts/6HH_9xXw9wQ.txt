 Gator Magnetics Wall Target System installation. Using a wall stud finder, mark the locations of the wall studs. Place your first wall target on the wall lining up the screw holes on the wall target with the wall stud locations and install the first screw. Place a level on the top of the wall target and swivel the wall target until level. Install the remaining five screws. Be sure to drive each screw in as straight as possible so that the screw head seats perfectly in the countersunk screw hole. Place the next wall target, making sure it fits tightly into the previous wall target and install the first screw. Install the remaining five screws. Repeat these installation instructions for each wall target you wish to install. To install Gator Magnetics Edge Caps, simply place the edge cap tightly next to the last wall target in the row and install the three screws. Repeat these instructions to install the edge cap on the other end of the wall target row. Your Gator Magnetics Wall Target System is ready to go to work.

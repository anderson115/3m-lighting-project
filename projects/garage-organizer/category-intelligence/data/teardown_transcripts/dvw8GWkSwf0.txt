 Okay, so this video is comparing the Craftsman Versatrac product to the rubber made fast track. And these are two of the more popular garage hook systems, rail systems. So this is the Versatrac. You put it on the wall, level it. Has these end caps here. You can combine as many as you want. It has all different hooks. You can see the screws because this is all one solid piece here. And then you put your hooks on as you want them and they slide wherever you want them to go. And then you lock them in place. And they have many different hook options, which are pretty cool. My problem with this is I feel like the hooks are very shaky. I wish they were more stable. And that is the Versatrac. These are tap cons. These are white tap cons. So come over here. The other side of my garage, I have the fast track rail. Fast track rail. Basically very does the same thing, but it's a little different. So it actually has a rail. And you put the rail on level it, screw it in. Then you slide this black piece on. And now you can't see any screws. So there's it's kind of like very flush. There's no screws. You can see here I have two different ones together. And that also has many different hook options. And these hooks are really cool because they snap. They snap in. So you see I got some bikes up here. So let me show you how they snap in. And you can put them anywhere you want. So this is a hook. They have tons of all different hooks. And they lock in. And they do wiggle a little bit. But it's really nothing compared to the Versatrac. So all different types of hooks. This one's awesome. This is like a real long hook. Now we got some scooters on here. I have another one on this side. It actually has a ball. You can put all your balls on here. So very close in price. The hooks are about the same price. Installation wise, I would say 100% the rubber made product is superior. The rubber made product is easier to put on the wall. Hold it on the wall. A lot of you screw it in. Make sure it's level. And I think it even looks nice or two. And it takes up less space. It's not as wide. So I have both and I like the rubber made better. Thank you.

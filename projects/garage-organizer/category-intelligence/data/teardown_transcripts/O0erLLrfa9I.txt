 Hey everyone, I'm Jeremiah from the HitYouTube channel, J3B Digging Canada. Now when you first receive your magnet, it comes in a couple of beesis. And I know this might be tricky to some, but I'm here to show you how to put the thread locker on your magnet. First things first, you need to get everything spread out. Make sure you have no metallic objects near the magnet. These, the eyeballs normally aren't too magnetic because they're designed to be touching the magnet. But your tools, you definitely want to make sure they're kept apart. First thing you want to do is make sure there is no debris or anything inside the eyeball. If you have a Q-tip, just give it a quick rub and make sure it's nice and clean. Next, you want to get your thread locker, open it up. You can use a Q-tip or you can pour it directly on. I'll show you both. But now you want to just take some on your Q-tip. And just rub it on the inside of the magnet hole. Clean up any of that you spill. Just like that. If you want to pour it on, you do the same thing. Just put a little bit on. Try to get it on all the sides. Use the nozzle what you have to. And you're good to go. Now what you'll want to do is connect the magnet and the eye hook. Get it on. Get it lined up. And just hand tighten it. If you have your tool with you, you can give it that extra little bit of a twist to make it lock in the place. Now that was pretty easy wasn't it. But if you haven't chosen your magnet already, this video here will teach you which magnet is right for you.

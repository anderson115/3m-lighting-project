 What's going on everybody? Homegrown reviews here in this video, I'm going to be reviewing these Flexing Mount adjustable garage storage rack. This is a above head garage storage rack. So this thing mounts to the ceiling. It's very easy to install. It has really straightforward instruction. I'm going to kind of do a demonstration of how to install these as well really quickly. So this is a four by four garage storage rack. This thing is awesome. Like I said, really easy to put together. It came with everything that you need to put it together other than the drill, the drill bit, and the socket to install the lag bolts. It can hold up to 300 pounds of weight. So that is a ton of weight for this little four by four garage storage rack. I wanted something that I could store my lawn mower in because as we are winding down with the fall, winter's coming and I honestly need as much space as I can get within my garage. So I want to get this thing up off of the ground and just get it up out of the way for the winter. Let's bust this thing down and see how it works. Something I want to mention about this Flexing Mount Adjustable Storage Rack is that it is meant for a nine foot ceiling. And my ceilings are 12 feet tall. I am about six foot one and can easily reach this thing. If you're a little bit shorter and half taller ceilings, you can just stand on like a five gallon bucket, get a step stool or even like a small step ladder or something simple and easily adjust these. Like I said, I want to get my lawn mower up here and out of the way for the winter. So let's go ahead and collapse down the handlebars here. So you've also gotten an adjustable hand crank which you use to raise and lower the garage rack. You could probably even attach this thing to your drill to make a little bit quicker use of this. But using the hand crank is super easy. Now that that rack is high enough and there's still enough clearance for my garage door to open, I can go ahead and stop winding that up now. So when you're done, you remove the hand crank out of the loop like this. And then using the hand crank, go ahead and lock down the locking latch. That just sits inside of the crank connection and prevents that from moving at all. Here you can see how tightly and evenly wound the cable connections are on the axle. This pulley cable system is so easy to operate. I absolutely love it. Guys, so I got my lawn mower hanging up in the garage now. I'm super stoked on this. I don't have to worry about the lawn mower getting in the way through out of the winter and then come spring once I'm not needing my snowblower anymore. I'm gonna put the snowblower up there. So nice little trade off there. Highly recommend checking out this flexi mount, adjustable overhead garage storage rack. This thing is awesome.

 You know, I really like pegboard storage. It gets your tools out where you can see them, they're convenient to reach, and very flexible. You can change it around as you like. But one of the things that's kind of bugged me about pegboards is sometimes the hangers themselves come loose when I'm trying to put a tool back or take it down. Well, here's a new product that solved that problem. This tool holder is made by Talon. Now it engages the pegboard in three places here, here, and here. Once it's in position, if I push this screw in, you see it spreads these two wings right here, and locks the entire thing in place. Let me show you how it works. These tool holders come in seven different styles. That's enough to hang up anything I've got. This is a screwdriver holder here. You see it's got a closed loop for the smaller screwdrivers. For the larger ones, all I do is cut the front of the loop, and then it just sort of the shaft just slides in from the front like that. This is the plier holder over here. It's just about any kind of plier I can think of. This is a short elbow, good for box wrenches. This is a long straight bar here. Works for things like my crescent wrenches. This is a long straight bar. I'll drop my grill right in there. And then these are curved hooks that are pretty much perfect for a hammer and saws. Well, let's get to work out just fine. And the best part about it is any time I take a tool down or put it back, I don't have to worry about those hooks going anywhere. I guess you could say I've got about the perfect pegboard.

 Has it ever happened to you to go to bed, trying to sleep, and finding yourself at 3am staring at the city? Or worse? We are in this together, my friend, and I think I found a solution for you. At first, they tried a bunch of methods that claimed to make you fall asleep faster, cold room, warm shower, and working out by nothing work. Then I tried a technique called military method. First, you need to take a deep breath and focus on each muscle of your body, including face and mouth, side the muscles, and then let them relax for a few seconds while breathing out. Now do that for shoulders, arms, fingers, legs and feet. Now imagine yourself in a chill place, like a beach, or a huge pillow. And I swear the first time we tried a fell asleep in less than two minutes. Trust me, give it a try.

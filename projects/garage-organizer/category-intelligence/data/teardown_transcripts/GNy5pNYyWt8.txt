 First, we have our standard single-sided magnet that has an eyelet on top and the magnet's on the bottom. This is best if you're dropping straight down off of something like a dock or bridge. If you're in an area where there's a lot of underwater obstacles, we offer detachable cones for three different sides of our single-sided magnets. This just slides right on here. The rope goes in and attaches to the eyelet. This will pull up and over obstacles or through the weeds. If that's an area that you primarily magnet fish where you do have a lot of obstacles or smaller rocks, we make one that is a solid metal cone. Offers a magnet on the bottom will again pull up and over those obstacles. If you plan to throw the magnet out and pull it back off of, say, a river bank or a bridge or somewhere where you're a little lower to the water, a double-sided magnet's probably right for you. This offers a location for the eyelet in the edge where you pull back and it moves flat across a surface where you can stick the eyelet here in the face and use it like a single-sided magnet. Drop it straight down. Our latest magnet is our brute boss. This was developed through a lot of feedback from our customers. It offers a magnetic field on the top, side, and bottom. It'll grab from a further distance and it will hold much tighter for those smaller objects. So regardless of your skill level, we have a magnet that's right for you.

 Excellent, I use 4 helmets, baseball bats and hockey sticks, great value for the amount you get, books are a little long for just skateboard or scooter, but allows you to hang your helmet with scooter, see picture, rubber on hooks are great for antithyllic, takes a little pressure, but you can spread the hooks. My husband's new favorite addition to his shop is the different styles of cool air hooks, he used the medium size to hang his collection of Milwaukee cordless tools, it's almost like they were designed just for them. Perfect for hanging scooters and toys in the garage, we can fit three regular scooters per hook, and a Toyota, TM, SOEasy, the kids actually do it, came with all the hardware to install, just attached straight to studs and they are incredibly sturdy, should have done this years ago and saved the garage floor from years of atticales, got these for garage gym storage, they work perfect for my bars, bands and chains.

 You ever want to put a magnetized mount on your smartphone so that you can use the magnetized mount in your car or on your desk, but you know as soon as you do it's going to leave a mark on your phone. And if you put it on the case it's going to ruin the case and definitely leave a mark if you ever choose to remove it. What if you want to have flexibility in the ability to use it on any device, maybe move it around different areas of the case. Once you peel this back you can't really remove it because the metal is so thin you'll warp this metal trying to remove it and it will never lay flat or be quite the same. So what I've done is I've taken the 3M version of the Ugreen Magnetic L that works like this and I've used 3M electrical tape to cut strips so that I can protect it, peel that, move it anywhere else. Boom!

 We just recently redid our garage to maximize storage. So I wanted to show you what we did with all these pegboard hooks So this is the space that we redid Obviously the pegboard is not included, but these are all the hooks that came in that set There's still tons left over But these hooks are really nice. They're very easy to go in They're sturdy They do hold the more tools that are heavy. So I did want to show you that And we even made a little shelf here for all the batteries and the hooks are holding that too So the hooks are really easy to go in you simply put them in like that and down you go And really sturdy Different sizes they have long ones they have short ones They have ones like this where you can you know just set a weird tool like that on top Um, you know, these are pretty heavy They're all on one So it's it's a nice set They do have these little holders too for like little odds and ends But we love it. We love how it came out and I would definitely suggest it to organize your garage

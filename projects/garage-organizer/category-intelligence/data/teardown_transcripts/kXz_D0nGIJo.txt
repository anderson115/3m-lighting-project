 Here's the best way to hang something from the ceiling. These are called toggle bolts. And depending on the size, they can hold up to 90 pounds without using a ceiling joist. Just drill a hole large enough for the bolt to push through. When it pokes through to the other side of your ceiling, the wings will pop out. Apply downward pressure as you rotate your hook so that the wings maintain contact with your ceiling. Rotate until it's tight and then hang your decor. Follow for more tool tips.

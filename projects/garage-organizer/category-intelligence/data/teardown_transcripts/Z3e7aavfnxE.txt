 Hi Amazon, this is a broom and mop holder hanger. It's wall mounted. It's made of metal. This one's 17 inches wide and it's very sturdy and durable. Very strongly made. It's a space saver organizer and you can remove these with a one-handed push. See that easily? Get it in and out with one hand and it just pops back in. It really works great. It really allows me to keep a nice, tidy, neat area in my washroom. I'm really happy with it and if you're looking for something to help you get organized, this is an excellent choice.

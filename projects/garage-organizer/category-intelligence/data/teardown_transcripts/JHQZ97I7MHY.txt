 Using your walls for storage is a great way to get gear off the floor and maximize space. From small spaces to large, Gladiator Brand has a patented wall system designed to meet your unique needs. The backbone of the Gladiator Garage system is our two wall systems, gear track and gear wall. We installed in packs of two six-inch-high by four-foot-long panels, our heavy-duty gear track channels are made specifically for use with our extended line of hooks and wall accessories, and because they can hold up to 100lbs per linear foot, they can even hold heavy items, like bikes and loaded storage cabinets. And for those wondering where to begin, we also offer all-in-one starter kits that include Gladiator Brand gear track channels and a variety of hooks and accessories. With a homeowner looking for the ultimate customization, Gladiator Brand gear wall panels are the perfect fit. And with the intuitive tongue-and-root design, you can lock the panels together for a seamless look that adds beauty and functionality to inner space. With two wall options, hundreds of hooks and accessories and a 10-year limited warranty, the only question is how you'll use them and where.

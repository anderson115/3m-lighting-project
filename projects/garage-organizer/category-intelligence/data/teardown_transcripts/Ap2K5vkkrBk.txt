 Hey, I'm Steve. I'm in my garage. I'm getting ready to install some more craftsman versatile track. I've already used a bunch in my garage, but I'm getting ready to put some on this wall, so I thought I'd make a quick video and show you just how easy this is to install. So the first thing I do is I just want to locate where my studs are and once I find a stud I mark it. So I'll mark two or three of those studs. That's the first thing because that's where I'm going to drill my screws through the versatile track and into the studs. What I use to install these are these ancient three-quarter just anchor head bolts. I screw these directly through the versatile track and right into the wall stud. It's real simple. I grab my cordless drill and that's what it's going to look like. I'm just going to bore those right through the versatile track. Once you have your first bolt in the rest are easy because you've got your studs marked. So you simply just level it out and put the rest in. Let me also say this when you're putting those lag bolts in, if you're only able to hit two or three of the wall studs, that's fine. The versatile track's not going anywhere. So two or three per versatile track, you're good to go. Now because the versatile track is basically tongue and groove, all you've got to do now is just stack it, put three, four more lag bolts in and just keep going up as high as you want and you can start it top and move down. It was just more convenient for me on this particular job to start here and go up. So there's the finished product. It only took a few minutes to install, literally. Once you get the first board, you can boom, boom, boom. Now you can start adding all of the versatile track accessories, craftsmen, makes a lot of these. This is the reason I got this board due to their accessories and needing it for my garage organization. So if you're looking at the versatile track, I hope you found this video helpful.

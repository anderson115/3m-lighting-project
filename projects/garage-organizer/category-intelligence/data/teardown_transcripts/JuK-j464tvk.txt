What people say? I have a white IKEA wardrobe next to my front door and considered adding a coat rack or coat tree for convenience and more storage. Instead, I decided to go in easier, cheaper out and affix these hooks onto both the outer side of the wardrobe for coats and inside the wardrobe doors for purses, dog leashes, scarves etc. I couldn't be happier with the result. They aren't as attractive as a coat rack and probably don't hold the same amount of weight, but they are far more convenient, versatile, easy install and less expensive. I wanted to hang a big wreath, 5 foot diameter, on the outside of my house where there is a large windowless area. I tried a couple of other hooks and hangers, but nothing would hold it. Until this. Finally found a product that works for vinyl siding and holds a good amount of weight. You can find the Amazon Purchase link in the description below. Hope this video can be helpful to you.

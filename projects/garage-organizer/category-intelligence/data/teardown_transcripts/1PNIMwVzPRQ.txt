 Hi, I'm Craig Phillips in this video. I'm going to show you how to install this floating shelf a stronger way And it happens to be a lack shelf or commonly known as a floating shelf. Therefore you do not see any brackets They're cheap and cheerful, however they can be a little bit rattly when they're fitted to the wall Because that bracket that's built inside there is fixed in but when this is slid on you do tend to get a little tiny Bit of movement in there and that's where the multi-use can be really helpful The bracket slides out of the back and it's shaped like this And this is fitted to the wall you find your location decide what height you're going to be I'm going to put a little pencil mark right in here That's where I'm going to drill my first hole but before you drill into any walls Always check first that there is no electric cables behind it or water pipes We've got a socket right down the bottom here so if I turn this on Pull the side I go across the area where I'm about to drill to see if there is anything behind it And it's telling me there's not if there was the alarm would go off on this and of course you'd have to change your location Now a little tip to catch your dust when you're drilling because you don't want your all of these getting boards Get yourself a number low put a little bit of sticky tape on it and put it underneath once you drill catch as all the dust Now the manufacturers normally supply screws and plugs in here However these screws are about 38 millimeters so I always try to go a little bit above that And use a 50 millimeter screw Please start plugging push it in as far as you can Take a little hammer hammer it down so it's flat And that isn't flat Next place your bracket over your plug Start to put the screw in hand tightening and then take your cordless drill and drive it in Now at this point we don't have to get a level It's going to be loose The next stage is to take your spirit level and make sure you get that perfectly level So now we can drill these two and these two And then once them two screws are screwed in either side you can come back to the loose one in the middle And drive that in nice and tight so your bracket is really solid To your solid wall So then take your shelf place it over the actual brackets And you'll see it slide back to the wall However the problem I have with these now if you feel like it's got Little tiny bit of rattle in it just a little bit And also I found just being from experience I have fitted hundreds of these on makeover shows When I place my spirit level on there now the front of that is dropping down Just a fraction it's about three or four millimeters That's where the multi-use is going to fix it I'm going to be placing bottles and glasses on here out of each of the children so it must be secure So then you remove it and apply Some of your multi-use now all the way along the back of here the lint of the bracket and in the two holes Okay Even a place on the edge of the bracket Nice and secure now So that's how you install a floating shelf if you're looking for more inspiration or how to videos Check us out on all social media handles and don't forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel for the full videos

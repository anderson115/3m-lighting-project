 Hi, in this video I'm going to demonstrate how to solve this problem. The problem of the mobs and brooms not being in a good storage position. So here are the mobs and I'll just show you the broom. So as you can see the broom is in the cupboard, it keeps falling out, not always easy to get, kind of in the way of things because you can't really fool the cupboard up because then it blocks the broom and you want to pull it out. So this is a quick solution on how to solve this problem. Right, so this is what I purchased and I've installed it in a few places and it works pretty neat. What it is, it's a plastic unit with some rubberizing and it actually supposed to stow the, you've got your dustpan, brush and mobs and so forth neatly. Okay, so there are different brands, I'm not promoting this particular brand, I'm just showing you how I installed it and how effective this product actually is. Alright, so I'm going to install it here behind the door and without further ado, let's get cracking. Okay, before you install it, it's useful to first check the heart. Now for example, there's no point installing it low and then if the broom is constantly hitting the floor, you see it slides out like that, that's not going to help. So it's best to actually install it, probably shoulder the heart. I'll put a mop here, let's have a look. There you go, yeah. Yeah, that's a bad one. So I'm going to install it on this line, this shit. Okay, it comes with a template. This is the template and I've put some tape on the wall. Look, with Facebook it's a little bit more difficult because it's not easy to stick this on the wall and then also hold this level. So the correct way to do it would be to put this on your wall, check with the with a spirit level marker off with a pen and then you're ready to pull. But what I normally do is I just put on a reaction unit, which I'm going to put here, I'm going to, I don't mind that it's coming after a little bit here because I have this alarm sensor here and I don't want this to actually be too close to it. So maybe in your situation you would install it more neatly like that, but I actually need to put it as close to the edge as possible and that's why I'm actually installing it over. But anyway, I'm just going to put this spirit level here and there it's straight and now what I do is I put on a smaller, but this is a very small bit which can easily get through this hole here and that becomes my reference point and then I'll do the next one here. Right, so now I'm going to drill out those holes, I'm just going to change the bit to the correct size, which is a number seven. How do I know it's another seven? The package of wall plugs and screws that came with the unit is actually needs another seven, but and how you know that is if you line them up, you can see there's the wall plug and there's the but that's a complete match, so that's seven and seven. Right, so now I'm just going to... Okay, there's one and here. There we go. I'm just going to push these in, then right. Okay, I'm tightening it fully. I'm going to check the level, the level is that's perfectly straight, yes that's it, perfectly straight and now I will just drill the other holes. Now the tip is done, push this all the way in. You want to be able to guide the screws, so I keep it a little bit of distance so I can see that it's going in. There we go. There we go. That's it. Now one of the problems with Facebook is the line might be skew of the Facebook is the wall line, but this might be straight, so I want to detect that in consideration, because as you can see this is 100% straight while the actual wall line is a little bit skewed, but nevertheless it's just one of those things. As you can see, this is actually perfectly straight and the line on the wall is actually a little bit skewed, but one of those things. Okay, so now we've installed this thing, just to give you a bit of a review, these are quite strong. You can see that not that flimsy, there's a rubber rising inside here, so what happens is when you put your broom, there's a rubber here and a rubber here and it actually wedges between it, so that's why it gets stuck. You might want to put a dustpan, as you can see, pretty strong. So you can put the dustpan and it's full listing up. To put the broom either, I mean the mop, you can put it either way, just putting it down just for all you can see. There we go. Right, so there's the life hack here, out of the way, solve the problem as you can see and off the ground, and that solves this problem. So thanks for watching. Hope this was informative and I hope it helped you. Cheers.

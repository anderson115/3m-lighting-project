 Amazon basic shelves. This one right here is five shelves with leveling feet. This one is also five shelves. But as you see it has the casters or the wheels. What are the differences? Weight capacity is a big difference. The one without the wheels can handle 300 pounds of load per shelf. This one with the wheel can handle only 132 pounds per shelf, but it's more movable. Now another thing to consider is the height. With the wheels you actually add more heights. The one with the wheel is 64 inches. 64 inches with the wheels. And over here this one is 60 inches. So the wheel adds about four inches higher in terms of height. If it rocks there's a solution. These leveling feet are leveling feet for a reason because you can just turn them and you can level the height. And then you have less rocking. See that? It stopped rocking. Whereas the one with the wheels if they rock well they're gonna keep rocking. Unless you put some extra hardware to fix it and kind of change the height of the wheels. It doesn't come easily adjustable. So the wheels right here, I guess you can adjust them but you can't really lock them unless you have an extra wash with the locking man. So you need to tinker with it a little bit more to lock them in. But that's the main difference between these two. Five shelves, five shelves, 300 pounds capacity per shelf, 132 pounds capacity per shelf. This one you can level the feet to make more stable. This one you cannot. But you also have the extra height with this one. So keep in mind that the casters add about four inches height addition to the one without the casters. So these are the Amazon basic shelves, five shelves right here, right there. Oh yeah.

 So this is the rubber made fast track wall organizing system for the garage and this right here is the vertical bike hook. Why do you need these? Let me show you because you can easily slide it along the track. It's going to store your bike vertically so it's going to save you space in your garage. This thing is going to hold up to 50 pounds. It's the wall mount onto the organizing system right here this track and to do it you just push this little black lever down and it'll help easily glide the hook throughout the railing and this is what's going to make it wonderful because you can move it easily. This is a great organizational system for your garage. It is going to save you space and you can store just one bike per hook.

 Hey guys, Scott here today I'm going to do a review of these DIY magnets and I'll tell you these with the hook are so useful. Let me open them up and show you exactly what you get and I also want to give you a couple of pro tips. This is probably the third pack of these that I've ordered. I'm actually working on redoing a camper van and right now it's all metal walls so these are great. What I want to start with is you get these magnets here, right? You get 10 of these and in order to get them apart pull them. If you try going this way it doesn't work as well. So I'm going to set these down. This is the actual magnet itself and then it also comes with this pack of 10 screws as well as the I bolts. So what I want to show you is pro tip number one. You do not want to use a screw gun on this. If you do that what happens is the back will actually crack. So don't do that. I would hand screw these in and I have found that tightening just a little bit with a screwdriver works out great but if you over tighten them what will happen is this will crack across the back. So just pretty snug here and these are the hundred pound weights and I'll tell you this in combination with I bought these hooks. They hook right on here and I can hang so many different things in so many different places. It is amazing. So overall I'm really happy with these and it's one that I would definitely recommend.

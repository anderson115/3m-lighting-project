 So guys today I'm going to give you my honest review of this 14 pieces heavy-tuty garage organizer and this was sent to us by Wallabun for the purpose of this review. And what's included in the 14 pieces are 4 small square hooks, 2 small j hooks, 2 medium s hooks, 2 medium square hooks, 2 large s hooks, and 2 extension cord holders. And for a closer look you will see that the slip proof rubber material is very thick. And the steel bar has a thickness of 8 mm compared to the others that are only using 6 mm. And this steel bars are well to the plate in 3 different spots, so you can expect durability. Also included is the installation manual, and they also included 2 different sets of screws and anchors. This set right here is for a concrete wall installation, and this set is for drywall or sheetrock installation. I actually prefer this type of garage hook organizers. The fact that they are not on a track, I can install this hook separately and place them wherever I need them. When I'm installing this hooks, I prefer to install them right on the stud, but because of the included screws and anchors, installing this hooks is quick and easy. It also has an excellent load bearing capacity because of its 3 spot welding process, and it can hold up to 33 kg. And they also use a special spray and dip coating process. That's why this hooks are weatherproof and scratch resistant, making them an ideal choice for outdoor use. So guys, this is the 14 pieces heavy duty garage organizer from Waleven. Get yours today and thanks for watching.

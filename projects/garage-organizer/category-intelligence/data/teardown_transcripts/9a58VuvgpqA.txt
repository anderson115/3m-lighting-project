 Hi, Alania with WTI. Are you ready for spring, but can't find your tools? Thanks to Smart Alligy, I am organized and equipped for anything that spring throws my way. With four panels, I was able to turn this this shallow heap into a great work space. I was not worried at all to hang my five foot ladder and a hundred foot extension cord, because Smart Alligy has got your back with this rack. With an open space of garage wall, I was grateful for the 16-inch wall stud spacing. I was excited to see how easily the panels went up, and I love the ability to place them to fit my particular needs. I love placing items I use regularly right up front. The movable hooks are extremely practical, so you can switch up so easily whenever you need. Look at how many tools this long scoop hook holds. I use all eight. I am so in love. Thank you Smart Alligy for this garage tool storage rack. It has been a game changer, because organization is totally something that motivates me to tackle my lawn work. Well, jump into spring with this great garage tool storage rack. You'll love it. I highly recommend it, and that's just my point of view.

 These little Velcro organizers are going to help us. That is the small, medium, large. The small is supposed to hold a hose or a cable up to about 25 feet, and that's 50 feet, and that's 100 feet. Of course, I had this all the pins. I mean, are you talking about a hose? Are you talking about an air hose? Are you talking about electrical? So obviously, you can get more or less in there. But what is pretty standard is the weight. The small is supposed to hold 65 pounds, 75 pounds for the medium and 100 pounds for the large. None of this stuff is going to even get close to getting to those weights. So anyway, let me tidy this up, and I will show you the results. All right, one, two, and three, and they all had plenty of room to spare. I could have probably gotten 50%, maybe even 75% more with in each one. And there's the large. What I'm talking about is, like, if you look at this, like, like, the Velcro is left. I can all of that extra. So it wasn't like I was pushing the limit. That was plenty to get around. So I could have gotten quite a bit more in there. So yeah, they're going to be strong. They're going to be good. They're going to help us organize whether you hang them or stack them, whatever. They're just going to be a whole lot better than what we had before.

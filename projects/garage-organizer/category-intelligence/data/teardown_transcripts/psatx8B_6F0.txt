 What's happening to Nation Peter von Pandey here? Hey, I ordered myself another one of these metal shells I got this on Amazon and this one is a little bit different. It's in black and I think it's just I think This one is maybe Possibly Amazon branded so yeah, it is actually from Amazon basics, which I've had pretty good luck with their stuff It's I think basically what they're doing is taking kind of commonly ordered items Finding an in-house brand to do an Amazon brand themselves. It comes with three trays and Four legs looks like there's two pieces to comes on rolling Stock here and then also it looks like all the hardware to assemble it now I got a little bit of crap the last time that I didn't show how to assemble these I thought the kind of the sleeves inside the The openings there was kind of self-explanatory, but I shouldn't have assumed that and so what we're gonna do is we're gonna put the whole thing together here on camera now There's a top and a bottom to these and so the Flat you know the grills here where it's nice and smooth is gonna be your top because you have these bars underneath which will Create interference with stuff that's sitting on top of them So you want to make sure they're all right into the right way and Once they are I don't think that there is a a Top or a bottom piece per se they're just kind of all the same if we open up the legs here they are marked here top and bottom and So these are gonna be the longer ones are gonna be on the bottom and the tops are just gonna cap it off So we're gonna open these up here They do a lot of wrapping them up to make sure that they're Nice and pristine by the time you get them But all in black I'm assuming maybe powder coated maybe just painted but Get them all out There we go We got the bottom post out and I can tell you is that there's a a Female hole right here where I think the legs are gonna screw in and you can see the top posts have kind of like this alloy screw that's gonna screw into the The bottom bar so we're gonna do that for all four of the legs These Mashed up now I've noticed that these these little alloy screws don't seem to be screwed into the top pieces all the way So you might have to just hand tighten them down to Like it's a sorry about the time on this, but I want to make sure we do the full installation for someone who's looking at this as a how-to This one's pretty loose on the Should we tighten that up one way Just one All right, so now we have our four poles and One thing I'll mention about the poles is you can see they have little Cuts in them little bands cut all the way around and those are basically stops For the little plastic sleeves here, so the sleeves are what hold the tray in place They kind of as the tray kind of pushes down on the sleeve it compresses it and pushes them into those slots Which is how they don't fall down now we do have the four Wheels here with the screws that go on the bottom of the post and we also have a little tightening wrench here Think because there's a nut on the end of the wheel that we can tighten them in there All right, so we've got that and then we have our sleeves here. So I'm gonna unbox those I'm bag them We have their own marks with the letters and then the top So they're all these One thing I want to mention is that there definitely is a top and a bottom So they all they have a letter inside and they all say top on The outside and that's because they'll only fit one way so you want to make sure the top is oriented in the same place on Either side now you can see there's a little bit of a molded in Ridge right there and that's what kind of slides in to the cuts on the pole and so You'll feel them kind of snap into place right if I line up that ridge with one of these Cuts now it's not gonna move up or down. It's locked in there right once I put this other one on there too That ridge falls into that that cut as well and I can't move this up or down. It's locked in there I mean, I'm not trying to not move it. It's just locked in there and then once you put the tray The shelf down on it. It's gonna hold that in place in the and the little loops the little holes on the racks are Slightly tapered so the further you push them down the more they're kind of compressions squeezing these little Plastic spacers right so that's what holds the whole thing together So first of all I want to take these and I want to get the The bottom assembled here so I'm gonna move two of these trays for now and any of these little Plastic bits are just for packaging or for shipping so First thing I'm gonna do is go ahead and put Make sure that the hole with the screw is on the bottom I'm gonna feed one of these through and I want this to be pretty close to the bottom because I want to be able to stack as much on there as possible I'm gonna take my two tabs and I'm going to put them around the bottom The bottom hole there because I want this lowest tray to be as low as possible And then I put two of these tabs on another leg Make sure I'm at the bottom right around the lowest cut here and I'm gonna feed that through And I'm just gonna push it up in there and that's gonna lock it in now I'm gonna push this one up in there too and now what I have So you can see here I have the collar which you can see is a little conical So as it's pushed down it's squeezing that in and that's locked into place And I could even tap this up a little bit But just the weight of the shelf and the things you have on it is gonna lock it in even more It's kind of like tying a knot in a rope and then pulling on the the rope It's just kind of tightens and tightens that knot so we're gonna do the same thing on these and And Put two of these on here And feed it through the top portion And two more on this one. I've got it upside down though So I'm gonna put it Color on there and a color on there And feed this Alright so now we have all four Legs installed on this and what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna actually put on The wheels so that I once I set this up. I don't have to Put those on later now. I'm gonna just hand tighten these for now It's actually a little hard because not my chubby fingers can't get it and it tightened all the way up But we're gonna gonna do that That This one on I'm gonna tighten them on The bolt itself because if you spin the wheels since they're free spinning they don't move anything I'm gonna save you the time We're gonna jump ahead here to the rest of the shelves before we move on here I just want to show you one of the wheels here It's locked to the wheel is has a break on it has a little switch here by flip it up It unlocks the wheels and out free free wheels But then if you want to put the you wheel the card into position here And then you push this down it'll lock it in place. You don't have to worry about it rolling around. That's kind of a nice little feature All right now that we have all four wheels on in that lower shelf now What I'm gonna do here is I want to put one of the shelves the last shelf as near to the top as possible And I want the other shelf to kind of split the difference of be to appear to the middle So what I want to do is take these make sure the tops are up and I want to pick the same marking on all the legs So that I can put the shelf at the same At the right height and in this case what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put it one notch below This double ring you can see there's there's single rings double rings double ring and so that'll Hope you kind of make sure that you're in the same slot on all of the bars here. So I'm gonna Put this one on And make sure top is up One on here and when you're attaching it You can kind of slide the sleeve up and down a little bit just to make sure that it's in the groove and that you can kind of and you'll definitely feel it It's a nice tactile response once you get in that groove. So now I have all four of these little Plastic spacers on I can take another shelf here. Make sure that the top is up. You'll see that the the The sleeves here are conical and the wide widest opening is facing down Feed this down over all four pulls And over the plastic sleeves you want to make sure you don't bang them and not come out of the the grooves It'll be gentle about this but once you get it on then you actually want to kind of tap them down a little bit The weight of the shelf is going to be what's locking Locking them in place and in particular when you move this you want to make sure you're grabbing up by the pulls Not by the shelf because you'll lift the shelf off if you want to disassemble them move them to a different place Or a location you can pop them off like that and then lastly we're gonna take these and we're gonna put on the last ones And I want these on the highest point because I want as much space as possible and we're gonna assemble these Just like that Go I have one more set here looks like they also include one extra set of sleeves if you break it or lose it Which is always possible with plastic So I've got all four little lockers on there Take the last shelf And I'm gonna gingerly put it on once I get it in place kind of pounded in place in there There we have a full completed rolling shelf In black like a matte black finish. I think it looks great And you've got a really solid you know shelving unit That's very open and airy and so you can see things if you have things on the back You can obviously look underneath but these spit inside closets and addics They work great for an office whatever really durable cheap and easy to use I think I got this one for under 30 bucks And so to get a metal shelving unit like this the kind of with adjustable Racks adjustable shelves is really really useful Especially if you want to put like a printer or something on the lowest shelf you can adjust this So you don't have a lot of wasted space with paper and then supply So see these in a lot of places and then obviously there are much bigger ones that you'll see in like industrial refrigerators and warehouses Same concept same construction just on a much bigger scale so check it out I'll put a link to this in the description Pretty happy with it especially with the wheels. That's a cool feature to get around panda out

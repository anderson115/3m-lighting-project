 So this is a tooth ratchet, traditional tooth ratchet, 122th comes from AutoZone and we're going to try and turn this faster within the space provided within the narrow space. Doesn't work. This is a snap on, gearless ratchet. I'm trying to move the fastener with theirs as a gearless ratchet. As a gear ratchet. This is a gearless. Oh, this is gearless as well? This is the zero degree gearless ratchet. Turns the faster. I can do it even not even touching the side walls of the area. So the idea of course is it gives you the ability to actually turn the fastener in this extremely tight space.

 What's happening to the nation-peer-bomb panda here? You're gonna get hooked on these hooks. So I ordered some hooks because I want to hang up some stuff and I actually wanted to not just hang them up, just to hang them up, but I needed something that in case I removed what I was hanging up and the hooks stayed there, it wasn't gonna look bad. And so what I found are, you know, a lot of those removable white plastic hooks, but I found these and they are, I think they're stainless steel. They've been out in the cold, so I've got fingerprints on them, but they don't look like that. Brush like stainless steel, just a single post that sticks out like this, kind of geometric, maybe a little barhouse. And then peel foam on the back. They are called heavy duty. So given the fact that these are pretty heavy, you know, I call this like two millimeters thick there, they seem nicely made in here. I get four of them here. Basically what I wanted to do is put this on the side of my bookcase and then put my football helmet on it, my football helmet replica, let it hang, without having to worry about it fall down and if I want to take it off, put something else there. I know this will be in good shape. So let's try it. All right, so here's my bookcase. I've taken the backing off and I can just put this sucker on there. It's like this, hopefully it is straight because it's kind of a little bit of a permanent installation. Probably let it sit there for a minute, but I'm not going to, because I like living on the edge. And here is my San Diego Fleet replica helmet. Look at that. Hangs up there just fine. Pretty cool. And then if you want to take it off, you can reuse that hook for pretty much anything you want. Hey, I'll put a link to these in the description. They're like eight bucks or four. Peter Rompanda, out.

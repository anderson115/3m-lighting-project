 Hey, hey, I'm coming to you today from behind my laundry room door And I'm gonna share with you another product that I love and have used for over a year now So these are the command strip Room and mop holders when you pull the product out this little plastic piece moves forward and then to put the Room handle in you just push and it moves in causing a grip that will keep your room and mop in place So these also come with the traditional command hook adhesive Meaning that you can pull these down without damaging your wall and you can always get new adhesive strips If you decide you want to move it somewhere else now like I mentioned we've been using these for over a year now I have them both upstairs and downstairs. There are a great solution Especially if you are tied on space. I love them behind doors because it's a space that people typically think of as Unusable storage when really you can take advantage of every space in your house Okay, there you go. I hope you found this helpful if you did give me a thumbs up

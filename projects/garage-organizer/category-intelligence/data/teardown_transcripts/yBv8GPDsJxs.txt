 Today, I'm going to show you this really cool product called Sugru. They're sponsoring this video and sent me some to try. It's a moldable glue that feels like Play-Doh. It's really easy to mold it with your hands. It sticks to just about anything, and overnight it turns into a flexible rubber, so you can use it to fix and make all sorts of things. For instance, if you've got a charger cable which is starting to fray, or maybe you want to protect it before it breaks, wrap some Sugru around the cable. Mold it into shape, and leave it to set. After 24 hours, it will be strong and flexible again, and far more durable. If you've got a hole in the uppers of your shoes, you can smear in some Sugru to stop it getting any bigger and make them waterproof again. You can use it to do fun things, like customise your keys. And try experimenting with things to give it a texture. Or you can try getting creative and think of clever ideas to solve your storage problems. And you can use tape to keep things in place while the Sugru sets. Then after 24 hours, remove the tape and it'll be set strong all by itself. And because it sticks to smooth things as well, like tiles and porcelain, you really can use it for all sorts of things. I really like this product, it's just so versatile. Sugru says it can turn anyone into a domestic ninja. You can click on the links in the description below to find out more information and to see other amazing ideas for how Sugru can be used.

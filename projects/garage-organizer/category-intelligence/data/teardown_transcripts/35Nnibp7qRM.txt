My classroom lacks display space and parking holes into the maginetic boards is not a logical option so I use these magnets to hold charts in place. The first picture shows eight laminated charts being held, approximately legal sized. The second shows four poster sized charts, the pushpin magnets at the bottom only have the purpose of keeping them from folding. I punched holes at the top of the charts and now I can keep them together and easy to access to change as I teach. I never thought these little wonders would be so useful.

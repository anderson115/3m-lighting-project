 These are just so nice. I feel like Harbor Freight deserves an honorable mention with this. These are tasty. These are nice. The 21 I use a lot, so that's flex sealed. It's using that in lug nuts. These are shallow. These are metric, but these were on sale the other day. Man, Harbor Freight, what are you doing with the phone? Dang, bro. Killing me, I like the phone. Devastating. déba-stating.

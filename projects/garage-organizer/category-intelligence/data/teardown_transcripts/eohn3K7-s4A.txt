 Hi, welcome to awkward hamster. Today I'll be viewing these heavy-duty steel hooks for storage, garage use, basement use. And there's 12 of them here. Gone from the Eskie store. I'll place the link below. But here's the owner's booklet. If you want to read any part, more detail. Feel free to pause the video. So comes in wide variety of sizes. There's about two for each size. Here's the weight limit. Depending on the museum for wood, brick. It came with about 48 screws. And half of the anchors are easy anchors. Half are plastic anchors. Here's installation instructions. Here's a closer look at the two different types of anchors. The steel has been powder coated. And for the bottom, this part is final coated to make it less slippery. For myself, I prefer to use something like this for ladders. For my work helmet, I'll be using something like this. For my apron ladder, I'll be using the jagged hook. For the other one here, I'll just use this one for my hard hat. At one point, I even consider using these hooks. These are the ones that we typically see behind the restroom doors. For towels or linens. Yeah. Now I don't need to do that. Now I got a heavy duty hook. I can support 20-some-op hounds. The Eskie store, this, I mean these to review. But overall, I have no complaints about them. Powder coated. Vinyl anti slip on the bottom. I came with all the screws mounting hardware I need. I think it's well worth it. And I would recommend it. Thanks for watching this video. If you guys have any questions, comments, suggestions, feel free to contact me. Bye.

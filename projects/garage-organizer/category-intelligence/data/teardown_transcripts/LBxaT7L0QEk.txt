 Hey everybody, so I am on the world Caribbean quantum of the seas and today I have these little magnetic hooks Also if you have any questions about this cruise shoot a comment below. I'll try to answer your questions if I can Usually the ceilings are magnetic and the walls are magnetic You can get these little hooks now these ones claim to be 25 pounds You could put lighter things up there. I also got my toilet treat bag Got hat you know just little things but if you were to put just a little bit more weight like let's see my camera Nope, you cannot put a camera So you know they save 25 pounds. I would say you get maybe three or four Anyway, these are the hooks and again if you have any questions about the real Caribbean shoot a comment below. I'll try to help you out

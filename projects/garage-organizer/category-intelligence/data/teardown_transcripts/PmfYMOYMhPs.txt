 Welcome to my project. Hey everyone, I'm Joey Troxel from DIY Project Guys and in today's video I'm going to show you how I took this bulky foldable ladder and Using just a few four-hour wall mounts mounted it on the wall simple and easy now It's off the floor and I don't have to worry about hitting this thing with my car every time I pull in the garage This was a really simple project. You're just gonna need some simple tools a cordless drill a tape measure and a pencil this project was really inexpensive and it gave me a lot of peace of mind I have a link in the description below with everything that I use for this project. All right, let's get to work Here's what we use for materials three blackcock 10.63 inch black steel ladder hangers There'll be a link to the exact ones I used in the description below this video a cordless drill I'm using my raiobi drill a quarter inch drill bit to drill through the drywall and into the studs a stud finder a tape measure and a pencil. Let's get started The first thing I need to do is figure out where my studs were on this section of the wall So I just grabbed my stud finder and started marking out the studs I started with as far left as I could go and I just worked my way over to the right You can see here I'm marking the beginning of each stud and the end of each stud So I know exactly where the middle of the studs are Next you can see I'm opening this monster of a ladder to try and figure out where to put these hooks I want them to fall in the middle of the open spaces of the ladder So I have to get the spacing just right next. I'm using my tape measure to measure the length of the ladder from the first Middle area where I want the first hook to go to the last middle area where I want the last hook to go Then I'm going to take my tape measure and on the wall I'm going to figure out which of those beams are going to work for my hooks The next thing I'm doing is figuring out how high I want these hooks I know where the beams are now I try to make sure the hooks are high enough and I've decided which three beams I'm going to use to hold up my hooks now I've got my drill in my quarter inch drill bit and I'm just going to drill a hole into this first stud Now I've got my ladder hook and I'm going to put it in the hole and I'm just going to turn it, try and hold it level as I turn it So as it's screwing in, I don't want it to screw in crooked And then as it gets tighter and tighter, I'm going to try and get it to land just right in the face up position So I can clamp my ladder on The first hook is done, I'm ready to move on to the next one I just repeated this process again drilling another hole and then installing the next hook I hate heights and anything to do with ladders, but I hate an unorganized garage even more Here I am turning the second hook and making sure that one's in and ready to go It's time to move on Next I'm drilling the hole for the last hook And then I'm just going to screw this one in too Making sure I hold it level so it goes in nice and straight And you can see here hook number three is in and good Now we're just taking the ladder and carefully putting it up on the hooks This thing is a pretty heavy piece of equipment Alright, so what do you think? It's on the wall, it's off the floor I don't have to worry about hitting this thing when I bring my car in the garage And for 12 dollars in materials, it was absolutely worth it Alright, if you got some value out of this video, please hit that like button Show us some love so you two will recommend this video to other people Don't forget to subscribe so you get notified every time we have a new DIY video And please leave a comment below, let me know your thoughts, have you used these hooks before, have you used something else?

 Hey guys, just wanted to do a quick review of these heavy duty wall mount hook hangers. Got these on Amazon, I think they were like $25. I was looking for something to actually hold this kayak up and keep it off the garage floor. And this kind of helped me be able to mount on the wall and keep it out of the way. It does fantastic. With the kit, it comes with the, if you don't have any studs to mount into. In this case, I was able to use studs, but the kit also comes with drywall anchors and screws. So pretty much you've got everything you need. You just need a drill in order to get into the wall. But it comes with everything. These two, it's a two pack, so you actually get two sets of these hooks. I only needed two in order to hold this 10 foot kayak up here. And it's super sturdy. I anchored mine directly in the stud, so have no issues there. But it actually also worked very well to hold up chairs. So as you can see, I just mounted these. They're actually using the drywall anchors, but mounted those in. Just drill my holes, put the drywall anchors in. Sat them on there, leveled it, mounted it, and it holds all of my launchers. So it works super great. As you can see, you can just set these on here. But they're just super useful to kind of organize and keep things out of the way and off the floor. You can mount things like this. You could even use this to, like in this case, you could set lumber on top of here. Instead of kayak, you could set lumber or, you know, fishing poles, really, whatever you would like to be able to lay across there. You have the availability too. They're super sturdy. You're not going to have any issues with it, you know, shaking or anything or breaking. I think they come with about an inch and a half inch screw. So they're super, super versatile. You can mount all kinds of things on them. But I would highly recommend you check them out if you're trying to organize your garage. You can hold off on things. I would recommend.

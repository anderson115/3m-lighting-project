 Eclatty Interbrand. Product testing plays a critical role. Long before the badge goes on, engineers prove reliability in quality and test after test. So, how do you know if a workbench, shelving a bit of cabinet, is truly built to last? Is used state-of-the-art equipment to ensure gladiator products exceed tough specifications? Some of the tests include product safety, life cycle testing, maximum load, packaging and shipping, extreme environments, and color matching. Also you'll be confident using gladiator products for years and years. Engineers test all cabinets, hooks, and wall units beyond their rated-weight capacities. All testing is especially important for gladiator products. High humidity, salt sprays, and temperature extremes are just a few of the harsh conditions gladiator products might endure before they ever reach your home or garage. And to get products ready for all kinds of wear and tear, engineers use demanding life cycle tests to simulate years of rugged use right in the lab. It's easy to see how serious gladiator brand takes product testing, and that means more peace of mind for you. Because if the products perform like this in the test lab, you can imagine how reliably they'll perform in your home too.

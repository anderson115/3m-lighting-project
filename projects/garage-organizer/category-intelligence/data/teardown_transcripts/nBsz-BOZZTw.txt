 I find some showing this uleber magnet magnetic hooks. This comes in the 2 pack with the 4 magnetic hooks in it. So let me just open and show the 2 hooks in each box. So I will show you the quality and everything for this. So as you can see these are really like big hooks and looks like really solid. This is a mid off steel. These are the 2 magnetic base for these. So you can attach these in the back and then use it anywhere. This can be used in multiple places in your school, office, kitchen and stuff. And you can see the magnet is really really strong and I just like I made this 2 and not able to now separate it. So somehow I separated it out and now just trying to show you the magnet and its effect. So pretty much installation is pretty easy. You just rotate it as a screw and that put it on the metal. So you can put in any of these metal surfaces. Here you can also see you know the strong fit and these are the magnets like different magnets. So you can see that you can put it on a metal surface and then it's pretty good to holding and you can put anything on top of it. So this is another metal surface. If you like like a metal plate or something and you put it on top of it and you can see it's going forward and really really good strong with the, it can be or some heavy weights as well. So I'm just putting some towel to show and I'm just holding no issues and no breaking like till I really push it hard. You can be used in the kitchen just putting in towel and see.

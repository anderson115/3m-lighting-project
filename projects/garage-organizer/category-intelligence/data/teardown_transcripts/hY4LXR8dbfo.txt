 So we bought these for our kayaks. We actually moved the kayaks to storage and we bought this freezer So we had to move the other ones, but now we hang our bikes from it and you can pretty well hang anything on this It's a it's got two heavy-duty bolts to you know drive them into a stud and You can hang your bike on it doesn't Doesn't damage the frame of the of the wheel you can see nice padding there It's very sturdy. I don't want to I wouldn't hang on this myself But usually we have both of these stacked and the two of our mountain bikes on this other one and it's usually you know good and out of the way These are primarily designed for kayaks or snowboards or whatever But anything to heavy that you want to get off the ground in your garage or storage unit or whatever These would have be absolutely perfect for and I think I have four sets of these across my garage and the storage unit So highly recommended

 Today I'm here to share this pegboard hook set. This fits a standard one-fourth inch pegboard. It's super heavy duty and it has this really nice black coating on it so it's not going to scratch up your tools or anything else that you're hanging on the wall. As you can see here, I was able to hang a step wetter on the wall and then here I hang some of my larger chairs that I use for the beach. This one is my favorite. I actually doubled up on this one to put my weedwacker up. I love that it's super sturdy and my weedwackers out of the way. I love using this hook because I was able to put my roller skates on a strap and then dangle them from the wall. I was also able to use one of the curved hooks to put my ax on which was super handy. I absolutely love these hooks for just organizing my entire garage. I'm definitely going to buy more because they've held up the test of time.

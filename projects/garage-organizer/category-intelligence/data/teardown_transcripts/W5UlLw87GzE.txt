 I recently purchased the MyCAD medic hooks and I couldn't be more pleased with their performance. Designed for heavy duty use, these hooks boast an impressive 150LB's holding capacity, making them perfect for various applications, from organizing spaces at home to enhancing my cruising experience. One of the standout features of these hooks is their super strong magnet. If you use them on metal surfaces in my garage and they hold securely without any fear of slipping or falling. The sleek design not only looks good but it's also incredibly functional. I love how easy they are to attach and detach, allowing me to rearrange items without hassle. During my recent cruise I took the hooks along to maximise storage in our cabin. They were a game changer. I hung towels, hats and even bags on the metal surfaces, freeing up precious space. The hook strength was impressive. I never worried about them giving way. Even with heavier items, another benefit is their versatility while ideal for cruise ships they can also be used in kitchens, garages, offices and more. The quality of the materials used in these hooks is evident. They feel sturdy and well made which gives me confidence in their long term use. The only minor drawback I encountered was that the hooks can leave slight marks on softer metal surfaces after prolonged use. So I recommend checking the surface beforehand. Overall the mic-date magnetic hooks are a fantastic investment for anyone looking to organise their space or enhance their travel experience. I highly recommend them for their strength, versatility and ease of use.

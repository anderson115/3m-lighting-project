 Here at Tony Tensme, we're going to show you how to utilize and install a rubberized bike hook to hang your bicycle from one of the beams and either your cell or your garage. Let's take a look. You'll need to drill a guide hold for your rubberized bike hook. Just a bit that is about two thirds, no more than that, of the diameter of the threaded end of the hook. Find a point right in the middle of the beam. You go ahead and drill your guide hole. Go ahead and start your hook. You can use a screwdriver. Go ahead and tighten your hook. If you happen to have an extra rubberized bike hook, use it and place it into the drill tight in a bit and we'll use it to tighten the hook that we placed in the beam to hang the bicycle. Take your screwdriver with the extra hook attached. Put it on slow and go ahead and tighten it. Angling it at the angle you desire. If you overshoot, go ahead and reverse and just turn it just a little bit back. This would be the perfect point to hang our bicycle. Grab your bike by the top two put it right hand down near the crank on the down tube with your left hand, lift and mount your bicycle.

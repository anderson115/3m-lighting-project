 Ripped out a door and installed this arch. Made a video about it. But now it's time for me to clean this all up and solve every single drywall problem you're ever gonna face in your life right now. Problem number one. There's still silicone or caulking left on the wall. Always remove that. Problem number two. Loose paper. You can't mud over loose paper. Loose paper always bubbles. Use a bin zinzer or an oil-based kills and spray all your paper. This is like a bonding primer for the new drywall mud and it'll keep it from blistering. Next problem is ugly joints. All your outside corners. Shake them back until they're nice and 90. Problem number four. Huge gaps. Use a heartening compound like a sheet rock 45. You live in the States. It's USG 45. Use your 45 to fill all the gaps before you pull out the tape. Tape all your joints. And if they were extra wide gaps, double layer it. Let's get started.

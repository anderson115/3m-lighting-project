 Well, hi there. My name is Aubrey from WTI and these are the Di-Mag magnetic hooks. They come in this super simple and sleep box and they're so easy to put together. You really want to look into these if you have a lot of metal surfaces like we do in our house. They're wildly easy to piece together and I love them for the ease too. They hang what I need them to hang and hold and yada yada. It's great. They look so simplistic in our house and I'm just really happy with these and I even tested how strong they were because they said that they were 25 pounds. They hold my cast iron skillets. It's amazing. So overall, if you're looking for durability, simplicity and ease, then this isn't my friends. This is it and that's my point of view.

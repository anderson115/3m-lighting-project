 Hey guys, this is CMS Magnetics. NeoDME and Magnets. The B is for the black. The C is for silver. As you can see they're pretty small. The diameter of these magnets are 1.5 inches. Fairly small. Very powerful. NeoDME and Magnet. Has around 100 pounds holding capacity. So that in itself being such a little magnet, I was just taking a bag and think, well, let's go check this out. Quick, what? Alright, hold right there. Come on up. Alright, let's go hold this time. I can feel it. The air is thick with anticipation. Yeah. Yeah, that's what did it in the last time.

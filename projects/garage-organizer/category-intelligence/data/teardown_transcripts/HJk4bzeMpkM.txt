 Hey there, a quick review of this Dorisie 16 pack of garage hooks comes in a box, everything's nicely fitted together. Let me show you what we got here. I gotta say, I'm very impressed with this kit. First off, everything comes packaged really well. Everything's covered with its own plastic bag, so it's not all scratched up or anything when it gets here. You've got a wide, wide selection of options for hanging things, from hanging bikes, to shovels, broom handles, even Velcro straps for electrical cords. You're covered for a wide range of different situations. I love that because in my business, I like having an inventory of hangers on hand to be able to grab what I need, when I need it for a lot of different scenarios. All of these pieces have a really nice bracket welded on the back, four different screw holes for mounting, depending on what size screw you would like to use. The actual rod that the product is made up is nice and heavy duty, it's stiff, it's not going to bend, but yet at the same time, sometimes I do like to bend these myself into different shapes. It is pliable enough that I could spread these out a little bit if I wanted to, or if I wanted to bend them up, I could put this in a bench vice and do that. Love the fact, it's got a nice rubber piece covering all of the metal on this, so it's not going to mar any surfaces if you're hanging a bike or something like that on these. It's not going to be a big deal. Just overall, great value. Also, get these Velcro straps with a carabiner on the end. You could strap, water hose, electrical cord, and then I also do love the fact that they give you drywall anchors, as well as all of the screws you're going to need to hang these. Overall, a great value. I'll probably end up buying another box or two of these to have on hand.

 Telescopic magnets range in price from $4 up to around 60 and there's rolling magnetic sweepers range in price from $50 to almost $200. So let's get the testing underway and see which is the best. And the first test we'll see which telescopic magnet has the most lift. Then we'll see which one offers the best shielding. We'll see which tool has the strongest shaft. Then we'll see which rolling magnetic sweeper can pick up the most metal. At a price of only $4, the least expensive brand will be testing is made by Pittsburgh and sold at Harbor Freight. It claims to have a 15-pound capacity. We're gonna test that. Extending from 7.5 inches to over 29.5. The Pittsburgh is made in China and the Pittsburgh weighs 84 grams. Let's test the maximum lift for each of the magnets and let's see if any of them can lift this 42-pound steel plate. And the Pittsburgh performed better than advertised at 21.29 pounds.

The Proto is made in USA. 94 grams for the Proto. And the Proto has a 16 pound lift rating and it performed about the same as the Omen at 18.34. If it's all about magnet strength, the $8 embarked to the best at over 29 pounds. Capo D performed well at 25.23, Pittsburgh 21.29, and Macco Tools 21.17 pounds. Magnet size can be a big factor in accessing a tight space and the blue point magnet has a smallest diameter at 0.5 inches. Gear-wrenched magmaid are also pretty compact at 0.63 inches. The length of a tool is another factor to consider and the easy red is the longest at 37 inches. Magmaid 34.5 in Gear-wrench 33.5 inches. If you're trying to pick up a runaway net or bolt, an un-shielded magnet can really make things challenging. So let's see which magnet offers the best shielding. And the Pittsburgh shielding just isn't doing a very good job at 68.43 grams. In the Inbar really struggled at almost 259 grams or about 190 grams more than the Pittsburgh. And the Capo D performed the best yet at just about 59 grams. And the no-cry shielding could use some improvement at almost 110 grams. And the craftsman offers the best shielding yet at only 14.8 grams. And the Oman offers twice the magnetic pulls the craftsman and is still perform very well at just under 30 grams. And the Gear-wrench has just over 7 pounds of magnetic pull and they perform the best yet on this test at 1.29 grams very impressive. And a very narrow profile in the blue point really hurt it on this test at just under 44 grams. And the Magmaid shielding is about the same as the Harbor Freight Pittsburgh at just over 69 grams. And the client tools struggled even more than the Inbar at just over 309 grams. And the Magco tools not only looks like the Oman, it performed like it too at 29.8 grams. Have easy red maxed out the scale at over 500 grams the most yet. And the Mag Tools performed very well at just under 24 grams which is good enough to move into the third position. And a Pro to perform about the same as the Oman and the Magco tools at 28.18 grams. If you want to magnet with good shielding, the Gear-wrench came out on top at 1.29 grams. Crasman finished in second at 14.88 in Mac Tools 23.98 grams. It just seems to make sense that a stronger magnet will have more bleed through. So taking into account both the magnetic pull and the bleed through and forming a ratio, the Gear-wrench came on top at 0.00397 pounds of bleed through per pound of direct magnetic pull. Crasman finished in second, Mac Tools, Pro to Mac Coenomen also performed very well. If you're trying to retrieve a runaway nut or bolt through a metal filled obstacle course, a wobbly tool can really add to the challenge. At very close to 24 inches from the vice and without anything attached to the Pittsburgh, the tip of the magnet is drooping about an inch and 3.16. And that's quite a bit of sag. Adding 100 grams to the magnet, the Pittsburgh is now sagging 2.75 inches. And the N-Bar performed better than the Pittsburgh at an inch and an eighth. With the extra 100 grams, the N-Bar performed a lot better at an inch and 9.16, which is over an inch better than the Pittsburgh. And the Capo D is about an inch and an eighth without any weight added to the magnet. With a 100 grams, the Capo D is at 2.25 inches. And to know cries about the same as the N-Bar in the Capo D at an inch and an eighth. With 100 grams, the N-Bar is at 2.25 inches the same as the Capo D. And the Crasman has quite a bit of sag at 1.38 inches the most yet. With 100 grams, the Crasman is sagging just about as much as the Pittsburgh at 2.75 inches. And the Omen is by far the best yet at about a quarter of an inch. With 100 grams of weight, the Omen is under an inch to take the lead from the N-Bar. Without a metal passenger, the lightweight gear inch performed very well at just under an inch. And very close to 2.580 of an inch with 100 grams of weight. The blue point has about a quarter inch of sag fully extended. With the extra 100 grams of weight, 1.63 inches is pretty good for a narrow profile magnet. Just under a half inch of sag with the magma. And one inch with 100 grams is good enough to move in the second place behind the Omen. Just under a half inch of sag with the client tools. With the extra 100 grams added just under an inch and a half. Very close to 11.16 for the Macco tools. With 100 grams, the Macco is an inch and a quarter which is good enough to move in the third place behind the magma. And the Easy Red is very robust and there's pretty much no sag with the Easy Red. With 100 grams, the Easy Red dropped by about 3.16s of an inch to move into the lead. Just like the Easy Red, the Mac tools isn't sagging without a passenger on board. With 100 grams, very close to 5.8s of an inch, which is good enough to move in the second place behind the Easy Red. And to perform very close to the same as the Macco at 0.68 inches. And with the extra 100 grams, 1.25 inches is the same as the Macco. If you're trying to direct the magnet to an Inje Bay obstacle course, the Easy Red and the Mac tools have the least amount of wobbler sag. The old man performed very well at 0.19 inches and blue point at 0.25. The Easy Red did the best at 0.19 inches with 100 grams of weight. Mac tools is a much smaller diameter and performed very well at 0.63 inches. Before we move on to rolling magnetic sweepers, let's see which magnet offers the most lift from the side. And the Pittsburgh's telescopic shaft was pushed to the limit. And the magnet let go at 1.86 pounds. And the Inbar shaft seems quite a bit stronger than the Pittsburgh and the magnet performed better at 2.32 pounds. And the KAPO D gave up a little bit early at 1.23 pounds. And the No Cry performed almost as well as the Pittsburgh at 1.71 pounds. And the Craftsman's magnet is quite a bit less powerful than the previous brands and it let go at 0.83 pounds. And the old man admitted to 2.04 pounds, which is good enough to move in a second place behind the Inbar. Even though the gear wrench is pretty compact, it still performed well at 1.73 pounds. And the blue point has the smallest diameter in the lineup and it let go at 0.96 pounds. And the magmate moves into the lead over the Inbar at 2.35 pounds. And the Klein tools performed about the same as the Omen at 2.07 pounds. And the Magco performed about the same as the Klein tools at 2.05. And Easy Red moves into the lead over the magmate at 3.47 pounds. And once again the Mag Tools performed very well at 2.64 pounds, which is good enough to move in a second place behind the Easy Red. And the Prodo also performed very well at 2.3 pounds. After testing all the brands, the Easy Red came out on top at 3.48 pounds. Mag Tools finished in second at 2.65, MagMate 2.36, and Inbar 2.33 pounds. In addition to testing telescopic magnets, let's also test the rolling magnetic sweepers. At price of $50, the least expensive brand will be testing is Central Machinery, which is sold at Harbor Freight. 30 in Sweeper with Wheels. The handle extends from 30 to 44 to 1.5 inches. It claims to work on hard surfaces and low carpets. 50 pounds of Magnetic Pull. When pull release quickly clears debris from the sweeper, made in China. And Central Machinery weighs 17 pounds. Let's compare the Magnetic Pull on this steel plate. All of the Magnetic Sweepers are in the lowest position to maximize Magnetic Pull. I've zeroed the scale with the Central Machinery on the scale, and it's right at 6 pounds of lift for the Central Machinery. At price of $67, is this Toughham brand? 24 inches wide with a 30 pound capacity. The telescopic handle varies from 30 to 46 inches, designed to be used on grass, carpet, and concrete floor. The Toughham is made in China, and the Toughham is very light at only 13 pounds. Unfortunately, the Toughham really struggled in this test at just one pound of lift. At price of $73, is this tool with brand? The Sweeper has a 24 inch width. It claims to offer a 33 pound capacity. And the tool weighs 13 pounds. And the tool with moves in the second place behind the Central Machinery at 4 pounds of lift. At price of $75, is this grip brand? 30 inch wide magnetic floor sweeper. Collects up to 50 pounds of Ferris Materials. 17 pounds for the grip. And the grip made a day pounds a lit the take first place from the Central Machinery. At price of $85, is this 36 inch Niko Sweeper? Extendable handle reaches from 29 to 42 inches. Wheels have adjustable clearance space that ranges from 3-4 to 1.5 inches. The Niko is made in China. And the Niko weighs 18 pounds. And the Niko moves in the second place behind the grip at 7 pounds of lift. At $189, the most expensive brand will be testing is made by Master Magnetics. It claims to be more effective than a push broom. 6 inch wheels and a 48 inch handle. It claims to offer 400 pounds of pull. The wheels are much heavier duty with metal construction as well as bearings. And the Master Magnetics is almost twice as heavy as a competition at 36 pounds. And the Master Magnetics is adjustable on the go with around 4 pounds of lift with the nose parallel to the ground. With the nose in a downward position about 17 pounds of lift. So the Master Magnetics came out on top at 17 pounds of lift. The grip finished in second place at 8 and Niko 7 pounds. The bucket washers together weigh around 26 pounds. I'll go ahead and remove the large washer to give every Magnetic Sweeper a fair chance to pick up as much as possible. I'll zero the weight scale before testing each of the Sweepers. After rolling the Sweepers across the metal, I'll go ahead and gather as much metal as possible. And the Central Machinery left behind quite a bit of unfinished business, but it did pick up 7 pounds of washers. No problem letting go of the metal. And the Toughham has 6 inches less width than the Central Machinery. And the Toughham picked up 4 pounds of washers or about 3 pounds less than the Central Machinery. No problem letting go of the metal. Hit the name like Tool Wiz, I'm expecting a big number. And the Tool Wiz performed about the same as the Toughham at 4 pounds. So the Central Machinery is still in the lead at 7 pounds. And the grip has a little stronger magnetic pull than the Central Machinery, but it's the same size at 30 inches. And the grip performed very close to the same as the Central Machinery at 7 pounds. And the Niko is 36 inches wide or 6 inches wider than the Central Machinery in the grip. And the Niko performed the same as the Central Machinery in the grip at 7 pounds. No problem letting go of the metal. And the Master Magnetics is only 24 inches wide, but it has about twice the length as the other Sweepers. And the Master Magnetics moves into the lead at 8 pounds. All of the Sweepers did a great job of releasing the metal. So the Master Magnetics came out on top at 8 pounds. Central Machinery, grip and Niko finished in a 3-way tie for 2nd place at 7 pounds. So which magnet is the best? And the Mac Tools came out on top with an average finish at 4th place. The Magmaid, Omen, Proto and Macco all finished very close together between 5.2 and 5.7. When you consider both price and performance, the Central Machinery definitely seems like the way to go for around $50. I like the Master Magnetics, but it is pretty expensive at a price of around $200. All the videos in this channel glued this one are viewer suggested.

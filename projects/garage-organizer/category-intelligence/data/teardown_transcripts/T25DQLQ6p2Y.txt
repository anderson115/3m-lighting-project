 And right here I have a heavy duty hose holder and I wanted to show you this really quick before. I put it up but very solid and like it says heavy duty this will hold anything. You could wrap up 100 feet of hose on this no problem but also you could use it as a rack. So it comes with everything you need it comes with mounting screws and anchor. You could drill this into a concrete wall into wood or whatever put it into a tree. And then you could hold other things as well but I'm going to mount this on a post and hang up a hose. Let's do that right now. So I've got a water spigot right here and then I have nowhere to really put this hose. It's just always in the way so why don't we mount it to the post right here. So with the supplied screws we'll just mount this right here in the middle of this post. Super strong and durable that's going to hold a lot. And this is just a short hose but like I said you could easily put on 100 foot hose on this hose holder. Super strong it's going to do what you want. I can highly recommend definitely pick up one of these.

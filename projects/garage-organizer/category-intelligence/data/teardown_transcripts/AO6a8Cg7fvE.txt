 Hi, I'm Alan. I don't know exactly what I was expecting when I got these I just figured you know, they're little nice little magnets and just kind of a Toys, but I'll tell you what these things I Mean They Stick together you talk about strong strong magnets. They come with hooks Hmm hard to pull apart the hook is threaded this is threaded female you screw the hook in and You're ready to put that on I don't know poster Board refrigerator metal door tool cabinet you could hang some of your special wrenches on your tool cabinet with these Has so many different applications There's ten in here and just I mean I'm telling you trying to pull that apart is really tough and You can hang quite a bit of weight from these Because they just stick so well the hook is made well too. I mean this this this whole hook Apparatus is is nicely machined and everything but the magnet is where it shines It will hold up a lot of weight But just looking at it you wouldn't think it would hold very much, but I guarantee you it will these are handy little Loose to have around Teapas they can be and again If you're a tool guy maybe hang some of your favorite tools from this On the side of a cabinet or something you got metal doors. They're stronger than you think they are I guarantee you that and I really like the heck out of them and I think you will too. Hope that helps you

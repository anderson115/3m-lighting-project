 These are the Vahood Towelharks. These work really great. They basically have the self adhesive on the back here and you just put it wherever you're looking to mount it. Basically when I put these up we do property management so we put these and all of our properties. I just aim to put it at the base of the tap hinge here and just center it if you have a six panel door like this. Just works phenomenal. You could see her. Really nice hook. You could see her pull on her pretty tight. The self adhesive works really great. We've bought these in all different colors. White, silver, black, gold. They all do a phenomenal job. They look really nice and they just were very happy. They've picked these up. They sell them in a four pack. This is what it looks like right here before you take the adhesive off. It's got the paper on the back just peel it and stick peel it off and then just stick it up. I usually put some pressure on there for about 15 to 30 seconds and they just stay out. No problems at all. Like I said we do property management so we have a lot of tenants in and out of the properties. Short term property management. So there's a lot of wear and tear on the properties and I've never seen one of these come off. They just do phenomenal. So if you're looking for some towel hooks absolutely check out these. They're great.

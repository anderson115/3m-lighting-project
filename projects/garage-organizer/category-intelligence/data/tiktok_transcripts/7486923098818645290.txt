 If parking your car in the garage is a guessing game, this is for you. For precise parking, try a simple solution like a ball in a string. These can be really inexpensive or make your own with a tennis ball. Position your car exactly where you want it every time you park. I like to position the ball in the center of the driver's side. Make sure the string is straight and lays against the windshield. Now just, mark a spot in the ceiling. A lightweight screw should be easy to install into drywall. This is a classic solution with a five minute install. This also works if you back into your spot. A laser parking assist can be a great option, especially if you're parking two cars. I like to install these with an adhesive strip, and you can also secure with additional screws. Then simply just choose a target on your dash that you'll align every time you park. And you can find options for plug-in or battery-powered. Installing your own parking stops may be the best option. I like to use a bit of painter's tape to mark where the stop should be installed. Sweep and clean the area where the stop should be installed. Many will come with an adhesive or you can find one at a hardware store. Align it with our guide and press down. Three options for precise parking every time.

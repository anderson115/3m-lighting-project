 Hey y'all watch us transform our garage into an entertainment flex space for under $200 and it only took about 4 or 5 hours last year we used paper tablecloths and did like a temporary Solution but we wanted something more permanent for year-round. We like to entertain a lot football games, Halloween, we hope usually hosts Thanksgiving and Christmas So this gave us us a more permanent solution and it looks a little bit nicer We got everything off of Amazon and it was been ordered these flexible mounting tracks with detachable hooks and then what you see on the floor are just painting drop cloths that we used a grommet tool to make Poles and punch grommets in to hang the curtains on We did them all along the top and then we did a row on Down the side so that we can Connect them if we wanted to Now you see the final product. I think it turned out really nice and I can't wait to Put it to use next week for Halloween I'll try to link everything that we used in my profile and if you have any questions I'd be happy to answer. Thanks. Bye

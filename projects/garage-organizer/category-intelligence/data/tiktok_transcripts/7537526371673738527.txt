 Here Turn him Two to be a best friend. He said love is lifting on the wrist. It's not for all you better come to. Don't buy another tooth or something. Go raise your message on the pavement. And so bad don't want to with the wave men. White teeth is waving in the dark. Go complete the motion if you stop up. Go ask the dust for any answers. Go back strong with Bipi Gallagher. The world I love is tears I've dropped to be part of. You can't stop.

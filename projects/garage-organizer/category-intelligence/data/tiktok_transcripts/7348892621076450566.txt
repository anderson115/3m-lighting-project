 Here's how I made the storage rack for 102 layer totes. You're going to need 4 2x4s at 20 and a quarter inch, 10 2x2s at 27 inch, and 4 2x4s at 86 inch. Measure and mark every 16 and a half inches and screw your 2x2s on. You're going to make 2 of these. Next, screw the 20 and a quarter inch pieces onto the top and bottom and join the two sides. Just like that, you have a storage rack.

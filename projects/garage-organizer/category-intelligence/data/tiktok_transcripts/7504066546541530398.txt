 Alright, I want to show you all something with the bottom of this garage door. See the gap? Well, if you get down here and look, you can see it does have a really thick seal on it. It's just the door isn't being pushed all the way down. Let me show you how to take care of that. Super easy. Just over here to your garage door opener and you'll see on a lot of them. It'll be right there on the side. Let me focus in. See how it says open limit and close limit. This is how high up it'll go and that is how far it will push down. All you got to do, take a Phillips screwdriver. You're going to adjust this. Make a small adjustment at a time. Alright, then just test your adjustment. Much better. See how that gap is totally gone. And I want to go back and show this too. Let's say for some reason you go the wrong way and you go too far. Let me show you what it does. See how it stops way too far and we got that big gap so don't be afraid to mess this up. And again, just make small adjustments. Just like downtown.

 Welcome to part 4 of upgrading my brand new garage. I am super excited for these boxes behind me because it finally means I can get my tools and all my parts off the floor. To get this done, we're partnering with IKEA because I saw this on their website and I love it. What's cool is my local IKEA even has a mock garage setup so we can see everything in person, get our measurements. And we definitely do not want to install on top of a dirty floor so me and my wife quickly try to clean up as much as we can. There we go. Now we got like a fresh canvas. Okay, step one. Toss those instructions. Ha! Totally kidding. I'm a visual learner. The tool drawer was easy peasy especially with my wife helping me. Next up we tackled the cabinets which was no problem at all. Only issue was a cold garage. But nevertheless we got the cabinets done as well. Okay, clearly we're making progress. 50% done. Half to go. And there is another drawer done. And that is another cabinet done. I realized I have way more space than I have tools but not complaining. I love this work bench. I already got my power tool set up. And there we go. Job well done. Best part is all of this was designed to be in a garage like environment. So moist your dirt. Whatever else ends up on this stuff will not affect it at all.

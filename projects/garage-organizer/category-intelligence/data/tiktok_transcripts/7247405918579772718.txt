 The day has finally come where I can show you guys my amazing garage. So there's some DIYers that can literally finish a project in three days. This took me a few months. Not only did I decide to make over my garage during one of my busiest seasons, but also I have so much stuff. And I really wanted to take my time and choosing items that we're going to work for me, my small business, as well as my boyfriend. So this definitely took me a lot longer than I anticipated, but honestly, the outcome is absolute perfection. I am so obsessed with everything that we chose, the cabinets, the organization that went into it, and a lot of just like thinking of how things were going to work for me and my business. I did not realize how many things I have. My business has definitely grown so much in the last year, and I'm just so happy and grateful for it. But now I have to find a wonderful system that works for me, as well as a home for every single item. After we moved everything for my storage, there was so much stuff in my garage. I was able to purge so many things and organize everything how I wanted it to look, as well as be functional for me and my business. I love being able to see some of my favorite products displayed, and this took me a full two days, but I am so happy with the outcome. Like, look at how beautiful this garage looks. I'm super super excited for everything, and everything looks so great. What do you guys think?

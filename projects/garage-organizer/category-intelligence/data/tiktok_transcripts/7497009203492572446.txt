 Not to be dramatic, but I think this is the best thing that we've done to our house since we moved in. Organizing our shoes like this in the garage. Like this is my love language. One I love it because it keeps the shoes out of the house. Whenever I kept my shoes in my closet, it would start smelling and it just like grossed me out. Two, it just looks so nice. Like that looks so nice. So I did so much research on the type of shelving that I wanted. I wanted something that was off of the ground so that all of the Wisconsin weather could stay down there and not be on here. And then I also loved this is the alpha system from Container Store. By the way, I love that it was adjustable so in the future when we have kids or whatever it is, we can adjust the shelves based on whatever we wanted. And then I also like that it came with these little plastic things so that my heels wouldn't fall through. We just have it right next to our garage door. And it's so nice.

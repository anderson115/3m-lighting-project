 garage transformation, how to edition. First we've got rid of all the old rotten lats and then got to work adjusting the frame to suit.

They clip into one another and then you just screw them in. I screen anyone, we use Jair panels around the garage door. The panels then just pop in. Here is the finished look, I'm actually obsessed.

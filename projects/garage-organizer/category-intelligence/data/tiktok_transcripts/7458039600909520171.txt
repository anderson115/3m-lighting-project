 Okay, let's be real. Small garages can be a challenge, but with a few clever solutions, we made this space for first, wall hooks to hold clear storage bins for things like sunscreen, dog bags, and golf balls. No more clutter, plus we're using the hooks for hanging chairs, tables, and even golf bags. So everything stays off the ground. We added this ceiling mountain storage rack, and honestly, it would need to be made to be at eight feet by three feet. It gives us all this extra space for our seats and all stuff. But the best part is it's adjustable to length. For shoes, we ditched the wobbly and freestanding racks and went with a wall mounted metal one. No more worrying about your shoes toppling over every time you grab a pair. It's sturdy, it stays in place, and it looks quakely because nothing says organized like a shoe rack that doesn't wobble. Then we've got these freestanding shelves with adjustable heights. They're perfect for items you need easy access to on the daily, think tools, paint, or extra supplies. Unlike the overhead storage, which is great for seasonal items, these shelves keep everything you reach for often right at your fingertips. We also love this medium sized fridge. It might not be full size, but it still has plenty of room for drinks, frozen pizza, and ice. Perfect for a small garage without taking up too much space. This super bright 25,000 lumens garage light is a game-changer. It's perfect for those late night DIY sessions when you need to see every detail. With eight adjustable panels, I can direct the light exactly where I need it. No more dark corners or squinting. Plus the energy efficient LED bulbs give off a bright clear light with zero flicker or glare. It's ideal for any garage or workshop. Lastly, this wall-mounted power tool organizer is a must. It keeps everything neat and ready for when I get one of my creative DIY ideas. In my boyfriend, always up for the challenge, brings them to life. Plus it charges the batteries while they're stored. So we're always set for the next project. Check out the link in my bio for all the products we use to make this small garage work for us.

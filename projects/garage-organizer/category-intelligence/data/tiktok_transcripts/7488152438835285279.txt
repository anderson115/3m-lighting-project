 Welcome to part two of our garage makeover. I seriously cannot believe how good these force came out. Look at this before and then the after. Now guys, I did not epoxy this floor by myself. I did hire some professional help to get that done, but now it's time to complete this makeover and we went to Home Depot to pick up some paint colors. Because this whole yellow tan color that's on the walls is not working anymore. Now originally we were not going to paint the walls, but once we saw how nice the floors looked, we definitely needed to change up the wall color. These are the two samples that I went with. I wanted to do more of a gray color, but my husband did not like it. He thought it was going to make the room look way too dark, so we went ahead and went with this beige color. While he patched up all the holes in the garage, I went ahead and went back to Home Depot to pick up the paint color. As soon as I got home, we got straight to painting and I'm not going to lie. This took us a little bit only because the kids wanted to help so bad and we couldn't say no to that, so we got them their own little paint brushes. It ended up taking us two days because we ran out of paint. I got two gallons and apparently that wasn't enough, so we had to finish this the next day. And I don't know about anybody else, but I absolutely hate painting, but we finally got this done. This is the before and then here is the after. We flooring and paint in here made a huge difference, but now it's time to get everything back in.

 Agarage was such a mess. We could barely see the floor so I had to get organizing. If you're looking for storage ideas, we added this flat wall organization system. It takes up little space, keeps everything off the floor, and you can customize it with basket, shelves, and hooks. You can add as many as you would like for your storage needs. I created a section for the kids sporting equipment which ended up being such a fun feature while yet it's so functional.

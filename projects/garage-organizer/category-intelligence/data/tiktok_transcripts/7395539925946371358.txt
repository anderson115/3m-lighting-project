 I walk through some people's houses and I just think to myself, who has time? Who has time to do these things? In this garage here, right? This is usually just like a cubby. There's nothing there. It's just like an empty space. And the wall is often stained. So most of the time people are like, oh, my crawl space. It's a cubby, guys. There's nothing to it. But I'm like, what is this? Like a pegboard that they've installed? No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Look at this. So that you can sit your stuff on it, right? Sit your stuff down and then just roll it back into that space.

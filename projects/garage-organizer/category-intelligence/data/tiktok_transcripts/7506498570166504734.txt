 Welcome back to part two of our garage gym makeover. First video I showed you how I did this woodslot accent wall. Now we need to turn it into an actual functioning gym space. Starts with some air circulation. This barn fan, uh, tractor supply, and it was probably the best purchase we could have made for this space. Now we needed some storage to install these wall mounted hooks. One for all of the resistance bands in the foam roller and one for the barbell. Now the power rack and the treadmill we already had, but these dumbbells and the weight rack is a new addition. I love that the rack holds both the weight plates and the dumbbells because it saves us so much space. So I did these Q arch mirrors as small as one above the weights and a full size one in squat run. The finishing touch was mounting a TV right above the treadmill and we put it on a swivel mount so you can actually watch it from anywhere in the garage. Now the space is comfortable and it's fully functional. We do the best with the little space that we have. Now only time we'll tell if having a pretty gym makes me actually want to use it more. Find everything I use in my LTK.

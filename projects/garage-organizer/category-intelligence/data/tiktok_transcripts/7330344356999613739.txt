 This is where you'll always want to be. They leave you a take on it. There's a place that we go when you look at the light of splinters. With a splinter of gas to the luster through the cold cold winter. And I'm like, oh, take whatever's left of my heart. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. This is where you'll always want to be. They leave you a take on it. I will love you, tender. I will love you, tender.

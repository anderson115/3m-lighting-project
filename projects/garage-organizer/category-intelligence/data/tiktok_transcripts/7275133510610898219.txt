 I last night I kissed your lips Making grip to see from your fainted tears Last bottle of that quizzed lit of beer Just talking about life on stiff-sip, yeah you You know you loved to fight And I say shit I don't mean But I'm still gonna wake up on the new enemy I know that the last night we let the liquor talk I can't remember everything

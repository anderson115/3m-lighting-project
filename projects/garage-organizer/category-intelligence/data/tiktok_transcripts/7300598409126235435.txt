 If you need to organize your workshop check out how I did mine. It's very customizable and it's called French Cuisine I stain my plywood and cut them into five inch strips Then again at a 45 degree angle right through the center using my table saw mark where the studs are and Jill pilot holes Finish with a countersink Jill bit. I used three inch screws to put these panels into the studs I only needed a hand for the first one then I was able to use my spacer block and laser level to keep me consistent throughout the rest of the placement. I only used 30 inches of the 8x4 plywood sheet So I had a lot remaining for my tool holders. I used 12 panels total I cut panels of a smaller height for the back of all my tool holders and made sure I had enough room to place it onto my French cleats From here the possibilities are endless You can find a home for most things in your workshop by designing a holder according to its size and the orientation You prefer if you have any questions let me know in the comments I have a video posted on how I built my circular saw holder I have a few more to finish and then I will stain them all in one go

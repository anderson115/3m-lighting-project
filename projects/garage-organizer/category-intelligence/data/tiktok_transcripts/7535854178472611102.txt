 See how we transformed a garage into the perfect home office in Lounge. Our clients needed a home office and a lounge, but every room in their home was already occupied. They didn't want to use the basement because they wanted something bright and airy. Then they came to us for help to see if their garage can accommodate this. We removed the existing 18-foot double garage door and replaced it with two 8-foot wide single french-style garage doors. This instantly brought in more natural light and gave the space a polished residential feel. Rather than losing the entire garage for storage and parking, we divided the space strategically. One section remains functional for their car, while the other is fully dedicated to their new lifestyle needs. A combined office and lounge area. In the lounge area, we placed a TV unit against the wall with a mounted TV above it, then frame the space with an arrangement of picture frames. In front of the TV, we positioned a dark leather sofa to anchor the room. Underneath, we placed a textured rug, a sleek coffee table sits at the center, paired with an accent armchair to provide extra seating and balance the layout. On the wall adjoining the main house, we introduced a brick finish to add texture and warmth. Against this feature wall, we designed a custom workstation, a spacious desk with integrated drawers, open storage compartments, and upper shelving for books, decor, and work essentials. The desk is large enough to accommodate a full computer setup without feeling cramped, and we paired it with an ergonomic work chair to ensure comfort during long hours. To the left of the door leading back to the garage, we installed a bulletin board for notes and insurration. Finally, a floor lamp was placed beside the TV unit to light up a space. The result? A bright functional home office and lounge that opens beautifully to the street while still feeling private and intentional. Would you try this in your home? Share your thoughts in the comments.

 We're so excited that so many of you guys liked this project. For those of you who missed it, my husband and I built a storage tote organizer. The organizer has rails that hold each box allowing them to slide out easily. We are aware that the tote stack but this makes accessing the bottom and middle totes much easier. Exciting news, I made free building plans for the organizer and posted them in the link tree in my bio so check it out. The plans include the size of the totes, materials and tools list and a cut list for the project detailing how to use each board. I included all the spacing for the boards as well. If you make it tag us, we'd love to see your project.

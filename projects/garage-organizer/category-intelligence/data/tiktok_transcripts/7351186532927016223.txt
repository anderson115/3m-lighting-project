 So I bought 30 bins from Costco and I've seen people make these cool shelves online so I've had to give it a try. So I drew one. We'll make that 30. And then I started to draw a few more wood pieces and solid works until I had the entire plan. I then printed out my schematics and started cutting. Boy was there a lot of cutting. So much that even with a vacuum attached, still had a lot of sawdust. I don't like looking at the 2x4s so my wife kindly volunteered to help me paint them all black, which definitely looks a lot better. We then began to put them all together. I had 4x4s for the corners and then 2x4s for everything else. With 60 cross sections, I really didn't want to measure everything over and over again. So I found it easiest just to cut a couple of jig pieces that evenly spaced the shelves every single time. I also got 6 casters from Home Depot that were rated 250 pounds a piece and with a simple step I could lock each of them into place. As an afterthought, I added 2 more corner joists for a little extra support. You'd have to load those 2 bins in from the front, but it did add stability. And then just a few final paint touch-ups. It was time to load it up. I now have designated places for all of my gear. A bin for bike helmets, one for tents, one for sleeping bags. You name it. And that is a 30-bin DIY bin shelf. Totally worth it.

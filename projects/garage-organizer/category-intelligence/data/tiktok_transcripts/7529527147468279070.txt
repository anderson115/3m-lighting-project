 If I had to guess your garage is messy just like mine and if I also had to guess you'd like some practical functional storage But don't know where to get it. Well, I searched the internet far and wide and I found it for it These garage storage lockers are the ticket the place to hold your kids sports Enter gear summer gear stuff that you need to be able to find but that you don't want all over the floor of your house And you also don't want it all over the floor your garage I bought two sets of these so that I had four total lockers one for each of my kids each locker has three hooks a seat That doubles as a deep storage bin to put stuff down in and a place on the bottom for each it took me one hour and Nineteen minutes to put one set together with toddler distractions My husband took a little bit longer than that and I won't let him forget it Leads floaties balls helmets roller skates tennis rackets winter gear seasonal shoes the stuff that you are always trying to find and don't know where it is I am excited that my garage feels more organized. Tell me you're in your mid-30s without telling me you're in your mid-30s

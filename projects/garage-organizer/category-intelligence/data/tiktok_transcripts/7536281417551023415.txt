 So if I could give anybody a garage hack, I would say right now, go to Sam's Club, you don't even have to be a member. Check out as a guest and buy this tool drawer or whatever they call it, I call it a tool cart. $499, it's half the price of anything you'll find anywhere else, even at Harbor Freight. And then go to Dollar Tree or Dollar General on your way home and pick up these white bins. My employee, Karina, she set this whole thing up for me, she bought the bins, and then she organized every single drill bit in Mill. When I'm looking for something, I can spend 10 seconds doing it. And I can tell you right now being organized and knowing where the tools are, is 85% of the battle when you're actually doing a job. So instead of spending 20 minutes looking for your tap and die set, you can spend 10 seconds, find it, and then go do your job. So I want to see what everybody else has because my one singular garage hack, but I know that I can never stop learning. So I want to see what you guys have to show me, so that way I can get more garage hacks and save my time, make more money.

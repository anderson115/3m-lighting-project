 I think garages need a reprand because this is what our garage looked like before, so we dry-walled it and painted everything white to make it look a little more cohesive. We've been slowly working on it by adding these slotted panels that hide the mismatched doors and give us extra storage. Now that it's time to work on this hot mess of not well utilized phase, we started to look up garage storage. And a lot of what we could find was just sad, sterile, gray metal, which I'm sure is great for durability and it has its own look. But we have our garage in our backyard, so we hang out in there a lot and use it for hosting, so my idea is to make it just as functional as a workspace. But it looked like a space you'd actually want to spend time. So we got some used kitchen cabinets off Facebook Marketplace, which are a fraction of the price by the way if you don't need a custom size. I love that this side has this pantry storage because it's just as much space as the garage storage, but a little less garage. Now it started to feel different with the wood cabinets in, but what really started to change things was this Roman clay pan. Before we even did the second coat, you know I couldn't wait to test out the tile I want to use as a short back splash. But before we start any of that, we're going to rework this rolling bar that we have. And we are planning on restating the cabinets to a walnut color to give it a little contrast from the wood on the back wall. Is that going to be such a big project? And now that the cabinets are up, I don't know if I mine the light wood, but with new hardware. Someone please talk me in or out of this. Should we stain them or not?

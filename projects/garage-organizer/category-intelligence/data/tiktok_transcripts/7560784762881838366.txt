 Flash as we transform this garage into a bedroom. Here's what it looked like before after we got it all cleaned out. The first step in the remodel was the demo. We remodel this whole basement, so after the demo the walls were all removed. This left a clean slate to reconfigure the new layout. Once the new walls were all framed in, the windows were put in, and this is where the garage door used to be. Now just to clarify, we do have a garage upstairs that we use. This one was the extra that we decided to utilize better as a bedroom for our kids. After the installation was installed, the drywall went up, and that's when you could really start envisioning what this room is gonna look like. The next stage was carpet install and painting. Okay time to come check this out. The walls are pearly white and the doors and trim are interfaced hand, both by children Williams. I added a little character with wallpaper, and this is what this base looks like now. It's just wild to think this used to be the garage. This was a really big room transformation, but we're really glad we did it, the layout is so much better for our family now.

 Hi, I'm Adriana and welcome to a day in the life of a professional organizer. Today I'm taking you behind the scenes as we work on a garage. The first step of organizing, take everything out. I know it looks worse before it gets better, but trust me, this is where the magic starts. Next is time to sort and categorize. I didn't get much of this part on camera, but this is where the real work happens, putting like items together and deciding what stays. Next, we're installing a few of the organizational solutions we recommended for this space, starting with a slot wall system for the kids sports gear, so everything's easy to just grab and go. We also added some overhead storage to get larger items up off of the ground, creating a more functional space. And yes, that's me hanging from it at the end, just making sure it's secure. Okay, now for the fun part, putting everything away, organized tools, matching bins, cute labels, what's not to love. And yes, even the closed storage got labels because if it doesn't have a label, does it even count as organized? Okay, are you ready? Here's the final look. Everything has a home. The chaos has gone and we can officially call this space sorted and styled. Think your space deserves a glow up too. Hit the link in my bio to experience organization that works with style that lasts.

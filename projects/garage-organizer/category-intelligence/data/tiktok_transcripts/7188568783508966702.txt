 I had this crazy idea to reclaim our disaster of a garage and transform it into a clean and organized workspace, and to do it without wasting money on overpriced garage storage systems. Like most projects, this one started with clearing the walls and giving them a fresh coat of paint. Since I do all my work outside, I wanted a small space next to the garage door dedicated to my most used tools, and heart has the perfect solution. Their garage storage system is simple to install and won't break the bank. Next I installed three tiers of cabinets on two walls. I built bases for all the cabinets and screwed everything, and I mean everything together. I installed two more heart storage rails across the garage to hold my outdoor tools, and two more again to hold tarps. Although I'm not yet finished with the makeover, I've come a long way in with my wife taking point on organizing, we're almost done with phase one. I love my little storage space near the door. I've got my heart, foreport, charging station, battery storage, work lights, drill and driver bits, and all the other things I want to have at arm's length when I'm working. If you've been DIY-ing as long as we have, you know that a simple storage rack won't solve all of your storage needs. As you can see, we need shells and lots of them, which is why I've been building cabinets for days. But if you're just starting out in DIY, you can't beat the simplicity, functionality, and price of heart's garage storage system. Stay tuned for updates and to find out what I did with my bigger power tools.

 Now when you pull your hose, it'll slide along the tennis ball. What? No way. Foxy. Well, we gotta try this. I'm working on this big truck and every single time pull the air hose, it's getting stuck on the tires or extension cords. Let's try it. I'm sure I got some tennis balls. Oh, there's some tennis balls there. Sweet. Alright. So apparently we just stick it. Stick it in there. You gotta get the balls in tight. Once balls are in tight, you're good, I think. Well, try the extension cord first. What? No way. Okay, air hose. What? No way. Foxy. It's so simple. That works so great. Fox. Been dragging hoses and struggling for years. Foxy.

 Ledge hanging rail storage is a great way to get clean, tidy storage that hugs the walls and doesn't take up your floor space. Start by figuring out where your tracks going. Rule a nice level line. Then mark your drill holes. Drill into your wall 8mm holes. If you're on plasterboard, you'll need to find the studs first. Once the holes are in, pop in the anchors and screw the track base for the wall. Next, snap or slide on the plastic cover. Depending on how much room you've got to work with, if you're joining two tracks together, use a track joiner. It'll help keep the ledge strong and load bearing. Then comes the fun part. Adding your hooks and attachments. Bikes, tools, garden gear, everything finally gets a home off the floor.

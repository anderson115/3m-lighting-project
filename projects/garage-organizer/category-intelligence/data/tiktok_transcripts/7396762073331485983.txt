 Welcome back to another episode of Get Done With Me Afterwork as a Mom. It's part three of the garage clean out where we're organizing and getting everything put back together. I'm gonna be so furious with you and I was trying to be really cute with all these little shelving baskets in that one away soak. I need storage and functional space and these little cute baskets just weren't doing it for me. So we went back to getting the big toe. I'm gonna label them eventually, but right now I just don't have it in. I don't know if it's the fact that I'm on day three of cleaning up my garage or if this cold that I have is just getting worse. I just can't handle it any more. As you can see, the sun's setting and we've been at this for way too long. We truly have a long way to go. We are not even close to being done. So why we decided to hang these strollers and go to bed. It's 10.30 pm. That's all she wrote tonight. We'll be back tomorrow. Got pretty far on the one side of the garage. We're back for day number three. As you can see, the cute little organization was just not doing it. So we have stuff everywhere now. And yes, the giant inflatable almost took me out. But look at how far we've come. It's so organized and clean and the dumpster is full to the brim. Have a great day. K-Love you, bye.

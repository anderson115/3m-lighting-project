 Well, if it isn't the consequences of my own actions, giving storage unit not garage and it's probably because I've used this as my personal dumping ground for anything and everything that doesn't fit my house. So as I was looking back and feeling completely overwhelmed, I thought it made the most sense to start organizing things that actually should be in the garage. And I wanted things up and off the floor, so first we started off with our ladders. While he was hanging those, I went ahead and built this little organizer to hold all of our different sports equipment, sidewalk chalk, all the things for the kids. I already want to go back and go more at these because they were so affordable and so many different things can hang from them. I had brooms and shovels and all the things falling everywhere and this got all of those up and off my floor. And now all of our batteries for our power tools will always be charged because we installed one of these where they can just stay on the charger and then you can organize your power tools around them, genius. And now we have a more functional space that's giving garage.

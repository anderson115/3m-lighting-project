 The garage has been the catch-all for everything. I needed some serious help. I found a deal. I just couldn't pass up on these heavy-duty garage shelves. It was an awesome price for one, but it even better deal for two of them. It came with an anchoring kit, so they're anchored to the wall. They're not going anyway. You can make the shelves as close together or as wide as you need them to be. Hardware store, these would be hundreds of dollars. Even my husband couldn't believe this deal.

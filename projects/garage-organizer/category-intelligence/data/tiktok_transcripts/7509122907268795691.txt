 So we recently bought a spec house which meant all the options were already pre-determined before we moved in. No garage windows. We noticed this house has windows and they're garage. It's like a $650 upgrade. We didn't get it. But then you come to this next house and this has the windows and the door handles and hinges. Another upgrade that we didn't get, and you'll see this one, looks very similar to the house next to us that has the same thing. He's meant 650 for the windows and he added on the handles and the hinges. So I went to TikTok and this is what I did. Magnetic candles. Is that brilliant? Oh what? I mean that just looks so cool. It looks so real. And I'm in tour for like $25. And even better, the windows are magnetic also. I mean such a cool, upgraded inexpensive. My neighbor's mind was blown. I brought him over a show and he says, wow you upgraded one day. How did you get the windows installed so quickly? So we absolutely love it.

 I made the mistake of underestimating the size of this shelf on TikTok shop. I just didn't think this shelf would actually be this big. So instead of using it in my closet room for all my packages like I wanted to, my little brother came over after school to help me move it to the garage. Now this is actually for a garage because each shelf holds up to 400 pounds. And this thing is very heavy duty, which is crazy because it's super easy to put together. And to be honest, we really needed a shelf out here anyways. And this one has so much space, so I'm actually able to organize everything up here. Also the shelves are adjustable so you could put them on whatever level you want to, making some bigger than others. So where you put them is completely up to you. Now I'm going to put the size that I picked across the screen so you guys know which one it is. And I'm going to link it below.

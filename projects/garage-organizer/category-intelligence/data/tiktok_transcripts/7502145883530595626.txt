 Hello, hey, hi. Welcome to part two of my garage gym makeover. In part one, I emptied my entire garage, and here's a little before of what my floors were looking like. These floors were already epoxied when I purchased this home about six years ago, but it was definitely done poorly, and over the years the floors have just worn in several areas. I knew that I wanted to do something different in here, so I decided to go with resin flooring, so let me walk you through the process of how we got to that after. I made some cause and got a few quotes from different companies, and ultimately I decided to go with space city resin here in Houston, Texas. I told them exactly what I envisioned and what I was looking for, and they found the perfect colors to make everything come to life, but of course this whole thing is a process. From grinding the floor to removing the existing epoxy, to prepping, priming, and buffing everything to perfection, mixing everything together, and then laying down the metallics. And the final and most important step in all of this is laying down this clear final coat, which basically seals everything together and makes it scratch resistant and super durable. And yeah, this is the final review of the flooring once it was all complete, obsessed with the colors that we went with and how nice and clean everything looks. Stay tuned for part three because we've got to do something about these walls.

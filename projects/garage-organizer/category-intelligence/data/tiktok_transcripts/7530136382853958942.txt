 It always looks worse before it gets better. Welcome to day three of my dream garage makeover. Yesterday I painted the ceiling in lower portion of the wall black and purposely just went at it with basically no regard for staying within the lines. I'm just gonna paint right over it so it's totally fine. This was literally my quickest tape job and at this point I was debating if maybe I should have picked something a little more complicated to make my life harder than it needs to be. But the fact that it was over 100 degrees outside kept me in check. My paint was literally congealing and was so hot here. What is that? I say this every time I paint something but seriously a coat of paint changes everything. Oh and I know I did also say I didn't want to turn my garage into a black hole but I do want to turn this water heater corner into one. It's so ugly so I just painted it black to forget it exists. Problem solved. I should have ended the day on a high note with this satisfying tape pool but I decided to keep going and I've been humbled by a lot of things. But gas powered yard tools are really high on the list. And then my husband comes out here and starts it in one go. I think he's just trying to make me look bad or maybe he likes the fact that I'm reliant on him to get things down around here. I got to pick out the power washer and I used my free will and got electric. Thank goodness. But even with a quick rinse down these floors look atrocious. We've got to do something about them. They're next on the list.

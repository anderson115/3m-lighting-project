 My garage makeover is finally happening. With help from the RTA store, I'm finally getting my dream garage workspace. That's both beautiful and functional and everything is going to have a place. So since most garages are sloped, I had to build a base for the cabinets to sit on top of. This part was kind of a pain in the ass, but I'm kind of glad that I did it because now I know my cabinets won't get damaged if any water gets into the garage somehow. Once I got the cabinets all lined up, I then used some cabinet screws to attach them to each other and to the walls. To the walls, I had to shim them up a bit because, of course, walls are never straight. But I got the cabinets all attached to studs and they are not going anywhere. And don't forget to pre-drill your screws before you attach the cabinets to each other. Once all the cabinets were attached to each other, it was time to start putting stuff away and this took me days. Because I wanted the garage to be an extension of my home, I found these countertops at lows. They're laminate, but they look like marble, which kind of matches the inside of my house. Follow along and I'll show you how I'm adding more storage, the hardware for the cabinets, and DIY epoxy floors.

 I don't know if it's a known thing, but I'm having a bright cell and so I of course want to make it as easy on myself as possible and not mark every sticker. So what I did is I did a color system and I made a little flyer to say what everything is marked at and I marked everything and so many people have said how much they love that and how easy that is and it really was. So if you're going to have a garage sale, just a little hack, I don't know if it's known, it's not that hard, but it's well ever enough.

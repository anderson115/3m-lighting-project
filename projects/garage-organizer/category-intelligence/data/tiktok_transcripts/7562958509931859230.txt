 Okay, listen up. I finally found the top five solutions that you need to add to your garage to make it actually functional and way less chaotic because honestly We want to keep it looking like this. First up was adding a gear wall slap total game changer because everything has a spot But the real isore were these floors. We found these venta garage tiles that literally sound together Which completely changed a look in just a few hours Then we took it up a notch with this garage ready fridge freezer combo Which let me just tell you you can make it a full fridge full freezer or do half and half it is perfect for that holiday overflow That I know is coming and you know me I had to throw a quick coat of black paint all over and after everything was basically done I can't think something was missing and I will look back at my in-spill pictures and I realized I ideally wanted a mudroom Oh and the cherry on top a new smart garage opener with a built-in camera So now I've got the storage and security hand. It's crazy how just a few weekend projects make this space feel brand new and Actually functional everything here is from loads. So just drop a comment and I'll send you all the links

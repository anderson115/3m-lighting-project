 It's like a little bit of convincing, but I got my husband on board with the Weekend Project to clean out, declutter, and finally organize our garage. We tried to take this on while our kids were napping just to make life a little bit easier. We grabbed these new shelves from the Home Depot. These are the HDX brand. These were the perfect affordable option for the system I had planned out so that I could actually find things in here. They two came around and I was like, you know what? No, I just want to organize by myself and my husband happily let me. So first, I mapped out the totes and all the different spots to see where I wanted things. I got those, and then I also got a lot of other random HDX things for my first shelf, which is going to be like all of my home restock supplies. You cannot beat the quality of their totes. They are the best. I love that they're clear. You can see everything. The middle shelf is going to be for kids things, and the last shelf my husband's going to come back and work on when I'm done and organize the tools in there. Then the last two rows I left exposed for bulky items. Don't forget this is where we started, and here is what it looks like today. Now that we're finished, I am so happy with this. I can see and find everything so much better. Simple and organized space, HDX has you covered.

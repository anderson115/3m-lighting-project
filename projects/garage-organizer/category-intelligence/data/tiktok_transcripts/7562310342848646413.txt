 The problem with workbenches is that nobody tells you how to actually organize them. Hi, I'm Talia. I work in professional organizing and today we're going to be talking about your tools. Most people have their tools in a drawer or a toolbox and that's not necessarily a bad thing. But the items like your hammers, screwdrivers, and wrenches, the ones that you regularly use on project all need to be within reach and have their own designated space. You have a few different options with this. The first being to keep them in a drawer and add either drawer organizers and do something like this or this. You could also use a drawer divider and these help create boundaries but also maximize space in your drawer. If you don't have space in a drawer, you could also add a peg wall or a slat wall. Both of these are great solutions outside of the workbench and they also utilize vertical space. Now we're starting to make your workbench really work for you. And stay tuned because in the next episode we'll be talking about how to organize your screws.

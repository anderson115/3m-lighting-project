 The one thing I am constantly always getting asked about in the detailing setup has to be these cabinets right here. And this one is actually from the company Latia. The reason I picked it up is because it was the most affordable one and this one is actually super deep on the inside. Plus I actually have one of their older cabinets right here and this thing is amazing. But then I recently picked up their newer versions which have the black handles and this one is honestly so nice that all black just looks amazing and it really helps hiding that stuff away. And my favorite part has to be how these things have a lock so you don't have to worry about anybody getting into your stuff.

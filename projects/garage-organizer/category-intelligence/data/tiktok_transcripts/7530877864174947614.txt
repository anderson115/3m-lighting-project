 I'm tiling our garage floors. Welcome to day four of my dream garage makeover. When I started planning this project, I kept going back and forth between epoxy or racitec flooring. Apoxy racitec flooring. And as you can see, we clearly went with the racitec. It felt like this safer DIY route with way less prep, super forgiving, and I could do a fun little pattern. So yeah, it was a win-win-win. Our garage floors were rough before. They were super discolored stained and just overall sad. So this was the part of the project that I was most excited about. I thought I could knock this out solo in one afternoon, but it quickly became a family affair. Not because it was hard, but because it was way easier with two people. And my job was picking the tile colors and placing them, and my husband sat on the floor doing all of the hammering and snapping them into place. Division of labor added spiness. Halfway through, he noticed something under one of the tile. And once these things are together, they're not permanent, but taking them apart is a pain. So naturally, he just rusted all and it's slothered under the floor, like a little garage snake to scrape it out. Two hours later, we had every single tile down, and for reference, our garage is a standard two car garage, and it's about 200 square feet. And yes, if you can't tell, I did a basket weave pattern using three different colors. I think it turned out so fun, and so much better than where we started.

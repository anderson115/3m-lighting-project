 What do you mean this place is a mess? I know where everything is. Try me. It's obliad. Far right shelf, third row up under the extension cord. Socket wrench. Right where it should be in the potting plant. What about a hose knob? Top of the fridge, next to the gas can, next to the drill bits. Uh, where's your drill bits? What? Oh my god, it's not there. Where the hell is it? Oh, my wife moved it. She always moves my s**t. Honey, where'd you put my drill bits? I left them out so I could put them back on the fridge. Who puts drill bits in the tool chest? That is not where they go. What?

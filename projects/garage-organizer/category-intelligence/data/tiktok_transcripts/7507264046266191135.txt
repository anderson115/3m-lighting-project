 I can't be the only one without an entire wall in the garage to spare for staging furniture, so I built one that moves and you won't believe how easy it actually was. I had already built a giant mobile storage bench for the garage, so I used plywood and beadboard from a big box hardware store and attached it right to the front. And yes, I used plenty of tools I already owned, but it was still super affordable and easy to customize. I didn't even know that rollout vinyl flooring existed, but it's affordable, warms up the space, and if it gets gross from garage live, I can replace it or hose it off. Now I've got the perfect place for filming content or staging furniture flips without having to drag furniture into my house or battling my cluttered garage.

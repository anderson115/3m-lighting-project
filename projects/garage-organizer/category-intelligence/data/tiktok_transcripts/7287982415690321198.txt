 This weekend we decided to finally organize our garage. First I wanted to create a gym area. So I started by laying down these mats. Next I added in this organizer and filled it with things we may need when working out. Like dumbbells, yoga mats, and bike shoes. Once the gym area was set up we added in these hooks for our beach chairs. My biggest organizing tip is to always utilize vertical space. After that I decided to organize these shelves which hold all the essentials of our garage. I separated everything into these bins to keep the shelves from looking too cluttered. I also used these shelves to hold all of our beach accessories and luggage. And yes I know it's a lot of neutrals but I can't help what I love. Next up I stocked our drink fridge and added in this super cool anti-gravity bike rack. We put up a broom holder for our cleaning tools. And here is the final result. It turned out even better than I thought and I'm so happy to have a space as organized, functional, and looks pretty good too.

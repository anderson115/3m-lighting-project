 Living it up in the city Got trucks always saying the wrong Gotta kiss myself, I'm so pretty I'm too hot Got a police and a fireman I'm too hot Make a dragon wanna retire Man I'm too hot Same on name you know who I am I'm too hot Am I banned by a damn friend? Break it down Girl said you hallelujah Girl said you hallelujah Girl said you hallelujah

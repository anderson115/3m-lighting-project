 This is my garage and I've just received three amazing products from Giraffe Tools. Starting off with their vacuum cleaner and pressure washer, both the units are wall mounted and have extendable hoses so I can pretty much clean my car from anywhere in the garage. To power these units I use the Giraffe Tools wall mounted extension cord drill. Without further ado, I'll move with the products in the test so let's get right into it. As an off-the-ready vehicle, it's not a real vehicle. It's not a real vehicle. It's too much too much. If you guys want to check out any of Giraffe Tools products, there's going to be a link in my bio so make sure to go check them out.

 Some of our work, got another day, the work. Hard work, hard work, that's what they say. Hard work, hard work, earn my pay. Hard work, get off the rock, move on down. Hard work, work to go, make the call. Hard work, bring it on the doors in the morning. Hard work, work, let's go to work. Hard work, hard work, your bag of your shoes. Hard work, hard work, you load them up. Hard work, hard work. Hard work, hard work, you load them up.

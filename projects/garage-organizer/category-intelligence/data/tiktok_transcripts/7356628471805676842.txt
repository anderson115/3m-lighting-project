 If you're short on storage in your house or looking to get more organized, then check out these garage ceiling racks that we found on Amazon. We installed four of them about five years ago and they've held up very nicely as you can see. We have a bunch of stuff stored on them. And the most frequently asked question we get is, can you open the garage? Yes, you can.

 Today I'm installing my crab industry's two-post lift and measure out where I want the lift to go And we needed an engine hoist to maneuver this piece of equipment. It's huge Getting the two post-up was the biggest challenge and I can already see my vision coming to life Yes, I'm helping I swear once we got the two post-up We make minor adjustments and take final measurements on exactly where this lift is going to be We install the top piece holding the side post together and get to drilling the holes in the concrete to install the anchors The anchors are what hold this lift in place So I want them to be perfect the correct amount of depth Anchors go in straight and then each bolt has the perfect amount of torque Now that the lift isn't going anywhere we run hydraulic hoses cables and electrical through the lift The final piece of the lift is installing the arms these are heavy Awkward and the perfect angle to get them lined up Before I get a car on the lift I trim up the Swiss tracks garage floor tiles to fit them perfectly around the lift Because this is going to be the icing on the cake. It's all about the details I'm so excited and I can't wait to start using my new lift

 I'm so embarrassed about the state of our garage. Maybe it was just going through a post partum but it just became the dumping ground of everything in our house. So we've teamed up with Pinnacle and we've given our garage a makeover. So you can see here it's all done. But first off we needed to clear out the garage. We also ripped out the older shelving that we had and then we started putting together the adjustable shelving from Pinnacle. So it was great because then I could make sure my containers fit exactly how they were supposed to and then also put the tools exactly where we wanted them to go on the pegboard too. So we grabbed some containers from bunnings. That was super easy and then we just loaded the other side up with our other bits and pieces. This is it all done. Stay tuned for part two and we're going to do the other side of the garage as well.

 So our garage conversion has officially started and before people start coming for us saying that we'll definitely miss having storage yes I agree at home offices wait more important and it starts to move from being a hoarder. My brother-in-law kindly then started to do some investigations for our building control and which we booked privately. We then started taking up the half breaks this is so that it creates more of a flush finish once we put the window in and build the wall at the bottom. Also my husband's a perfection so this had to be done. We then began by taking up the garage door and we found the business man. We then hired a digger on a dump off of the day so yes this is me just screwing recording our camera footage because I'm just nosy but fully enough my husband did the exact same thing so clearly I'm not the only weird one in this relationship but then I can dig in the footings and yes I made sure that they filmed some content for my tiktok whilst you weren't there so they did not put things within a day so these are all done and we just received confirmation that building control has signed these off. Follow for part two where we sweat up the garage floor and share our plans.

 I love doing DIY projects. The problem is I live in Nashville and have a tiny single car garage. With all of my tools and junk, I had no room to do a project. Until I found this baby, this is a lifting garage shelving unit by FlexiMount that I got off of Amazon. This thing is incredible. It goes all the way to the floor and then all the way up to your ceiling once you got your stuff on it. I was so excited because this thing holds up to 300 pounds, so I could put all of my big tools that I don't use every single day and raise it up to the ceiling and get it out of the way. Now this was my favorite part. You can crank it up by hand or you can hook it to your drill and do it way faster. I mean, come on guys, this is literally like an elevator for your junk. Now that all my big tools are stored away, I actually have room to do some projects. If your garage is a mess like mine, this is your answer.

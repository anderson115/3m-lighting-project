 Garage storage hacks. Most people waste garage space by spreading out instead of going up. Here's how to fix it.

Number two, use your ceiling for overhead racks for things like seasonal items or things that you don't use daily. Number three, choose adjustable wall systems that grow with your needs so you aren't just organized today. You stay organized forever. Stop parking next to piles of stuff and use the vertical space you already have. Follow for more organizing hacks to take control of your home one room at a time.

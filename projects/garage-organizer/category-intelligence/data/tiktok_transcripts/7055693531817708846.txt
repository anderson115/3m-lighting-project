 Want to cover up that early storage space but still keep it accessible? Let's make a sliding curtain divider. For the rod, we'll use metal conduit pipe and hanger clips from the hardware store. Screw a clip into the ceiling joist on each end. If you've got a big, low hanging obstacle to avoid, you can split the curtain into two panels, one on each side. To avoid smaller obstacles like copper pipes, just use a wooden spacer block to drop the clip down a little. When the hangers are in place, cut the conduit to lengthen and clip it in, and tighten the security bolt to each end. If you need the pipe a little longer, use a set screw connector to connect two pieces together. Keep in mind that if you make a span too long, you might need to add an extra clip in the middle to avoid sagging. The rod's done, so let's make some curtains. This much fabric could get really expensive, but I found a great shortcut by using 102-inch long tablecloths. An expensive fabric tablecloth are really lightweight and best of all, they're already hemmed on the edges. To make them hang fold over the top edge, sew it down, and add button holes or grommets every few inches. Then add some thin, cheap, shower curtain hooks, and your curtain is ready to hang on the rod. Before you know it, you've got a great sliding curtain that covers everything up and is super easy to move out of the way when you need to access the area.

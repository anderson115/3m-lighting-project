 Oh my mind's taking me out of the ordinary. How would you lay me down? So dead and buried, on the edge of your night. Stay and drunk on your ride. The angels up in the clouds, my jealous, no one can pass. So they're so strong, so quiet and scary. You're gonna be kissing the ground, ground, stage you're wearing. You're gonna be with your tongue, or more of your tummy and tongue. The angels up in the clouds, my jealous, no one can pass. So they're so evidently, higher than the eggs, do you see? You're never your next to me, oh my mind.

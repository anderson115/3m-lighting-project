 Welcome to our garage and the famous shoe wall. The shoes, we put them in the garage to keep all the dirt out of the house. And one of the things that I've noticed is in so many houses. There is a pile of shoes by the door and it's just all the clutter in and out of the house. And so to prevent that, we keep all of our shoes out in the garage. Say hi to the people for last. This is our lonely house cat. And she's the only cat that doesn't try to run in the house.

 Oh, wait, wait, check out this before and after. So we had a problem with space and storage in our garage. So we finally decided to clear it out and start fresh. We put together the pinnacle storage system and you could already see a difference. We have shelves, storage boxes from tactics, long, small, deep and shallow drawers, large and small cabinets, and even a working shelf with pegboard, which is definitely my favorite part. So if you're wanting to do something similar and get organized, check out pinnacle and tactics storage both the fan of bunnings. Oh, how good does that pegboard look? Love a good before and after. Fantastic.

 Welcome back to Garage Day. I'm on a mission this summer to clean up, declutter, and get this space organized. Last time I wrapped up assembling these wall mounted cabinets, which was a big step forward. Now that they're ready, I can move on to the fun part, filling them up. I found that I'm most productive when I give myself a clear, manageable goal for the day. So today's goal is to tackle everything that's currently living on this rolling metal shelf. I need to go through all of it, sort what I can, disassemble the shelf, and get it up into the attic. This is just one of three large metal shelving units in the garage, and they're all taking up a ton of pressure space. So the sooner I can clean them out, the better. This particular shelf is a mix of tools and random odds and ends. Some items can be tossed or recycled, while others just need to be recategorized and stored more intentionally. To help with the sorting process, I picked up a few more clear bins. I'm not committing to any final organization system just yet. I'm going to wait unlabeling everything until I can figure out the best way to arrange everything inside the new cabinets. I'm a little nervous that I might not have enough room to store it all. The good news is that I managed to fully clear off that first shelf, break it down, and move it up to the attic. That alone feels like a huge accomplishment, having one less bulky item in the garage already makes this space feel lighter and more open, and that's exactly the kind of momentum I need to keep going.

 You can save thousands on your dream garage floors by doing it yourself with the Restoleum epoxy shield kit. First, it's all in the prep using Restoleum Clean and Ech. I scrubbed these 5 year old floors and applied the etching solution with a watering can and stiff broom. Once thoroughly rinsed, use the Restoleum Patch and Repair Kit on any areas necessary and grab some help. The epoxy comes in this convenient two-part burst pouch. We started brushing the edges and then rolling the floor. I used the dark gray kit and it was super easy to apply, but it is thick and sticky. So make sure you wear old clothes. Working in sections we started throwing the decorative chips and this part was so much fun. Throw it high to get it to disperse evenly and buy extra if you want a more concentrated look. After a 24 hour dry time, we repeated this process with the clear coat kit. It comes with an anti-skid additive and in my opinion, this step is necessary for extra durability and shine. Now my old floors look like this and it only cost a few hundred bucks and a few days of labor.

 Are you looking for storage in your garage and you want to save a little bit of money? Today I'm going to show you how to turn two of these Home Depot Husky racks into three. So what we're going to do is we are going to build two of the racks. We are not going to put in one of the shelves from each one of these and what we're going to do is we're going to add these shelves to the middle and connect them together like this Okay, so the cool thing about this is you can adjust these how high you want them if you want this a little higher. If you want this one a little higher if you need bikes put in here or anything big it's really nice you can get the bulky stuff put underneath and you get three for the price of two.

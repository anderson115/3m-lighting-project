 Tired of looking at your dirty garage floor. Yeah, I was too. So I decided to take it into my own hand and epoxy the floor So first up was clearing everything out and cleaning it I bought this DIY kit from Bunnings in the first step was to etch the floor with acid and then await for it to fully dry completely Separate the flakes into four even condens so you have even sprinkles across the floor Mix part A with part B, wait for your cryoid setting time and then get all your tools ready I got this nice floor roller from Monarch and look at that. Oh my gosh satisfaction level is high Let's go on to complete the rest. So my only regret is not taping the wall higher because in little parts I had to go back and clean the walls But overall this was such an easy job just to roll it on and then throw the flakes and I noticed going high With the flakes gave an even spread final touches and then I had to allow for the drying time which was 48 to 72 hours Adding in the anti-skid for protection and then I ended up giving it two clear coats for that added time protection I love the results obsessed

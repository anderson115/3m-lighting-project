 You're not gonna believe this is even the same space. Hi, I'm Morgan and I'm building my dream garage. Every time I opened the door, I was afraid my neighbors would get a peek in here and nominate me for hoarders. That's how that it was. So I cleared the entire thing out and painted practically every single square inch in here including the ceiling. Next, I needed to tackle the floors. So I took the easy way out and I laid vented floor tiles. And it kind of looks like a showroom now. Not gonna lie. But all the fun stuff was officially over and I had the dreaded job of bringing all of our tools and equipment back in to start reorganizing it to make it a functional garage again. And I just wanna know how have we accumulated all of this stuff? I was having major decision fatigue trying to decide where to hang all of our wall racks and little pegboards. So I kinda just went for it and hoped I liked where everything landed because I really didn't wanna have to patch my freshly painted walls. But now every single thing in here officially has a place. So maybe I'll actually be able to keep it clean. I hung this super fun and modern LED hex light and that was the last and final thing I needed to do in here. Oh, and we have tons of additional storage hanging from the ceiling. And it fits right above our garage door which is pretty genius if you ask me. And I know people are gonna ask, yes, I can park my car in here. But here was it before and here is my garage now. It feels so good to have a clean space to work on projects in. So what should I do next?

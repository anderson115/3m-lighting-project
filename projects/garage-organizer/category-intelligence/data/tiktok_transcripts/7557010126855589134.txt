 The problem with workbench is that nobody tells you how to actually organize them. Hi, I'm Talia. I work in professional organizing and today we're going to be talking about the tiny little random things you can never seem to get rid of. I'm talking about those excessive picture hooks, the mini screwdriver tape, and all the extra staples. Just the items that it seemed to multiply like crazy with every project. And here's how you're going to fix it, drawer organizers. These problem solvers are great because they give everything a designated home, especially having different sizes. First, you're going to take everything out, give it all a good wipe down, some of these items have barely seen the light of day. And then you're going to measure and make sure that these drawer organizers that you pick will fit. In my case, the top drawer works the best for these organizers because of the different heights of the drawers. Then you'll categorize everything and here's a tip, get really picky about it. This part is annoying, but you only have to do it once. And then after all of that, the fun part really begins. Putting the products in, actually seeing your vision work out better than you could have imagined it. And take a step back and enjoy all the amazing work you did and then get ready to plan the next organizing project because the next episode we'll be talking about how to get your tools in order.

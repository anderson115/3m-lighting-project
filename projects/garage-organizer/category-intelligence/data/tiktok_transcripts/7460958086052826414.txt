 4M is on garage hacks, you actually need. Number one is the ceiling mounted garage rack that a friend and I installed in about an hour and a half that looks great and is a perfect way to help you get things off the floor. It's very roomy and adjustable and can hold up to 600 pounds. Number two is my wall mounted garage vacuum that has a 30-foot hose and is great for vacuuming out your car or even sucking up what you sweet. Number three is my bike rack that is so easy to put bikes in and can swivel 180 degrees to get out of the way. Number four is my rack that I put on the wall that has a search protector with six plugs so now I have a good place to put on my chargers. Okay, thanks for watching. Love you, bye.

 So we're back. The highly anticipated transformation of our garage for Thanksgiving has finally arrived. For those of you that are new here, my husband and I installed curtain hooks with drop-cloths hanging from them to turn our garage into a party space for when we entertain. That video is pinned at the top of my page if you want a how-to. You all had lots of opinions and we took all of them into consideration. This is our first attempt. Well, second with Halloween. At using your ideas and bringing them to life in our space for Thanksgiving with our friends. To make the space feel more cozy, we decided to use two large rugs to cover as much of the floor as possible. Then we finally put to use this old chandelier that I found in a state sale six years ago. I used photo backdrop stands to cover up some of the corners. But I think it sounds stupid. I don't want to say that. I want to talk about the temperature. Okay. But everybody was all up on the temperature last time yet. So they didn't understand that we don't live in the fucking desert and it's going to be 60 degrees in our garage. Okay. Anyway, we're expecting a group of 20 including kids. Overall, this was a really fun project. We enjoyed working together and I can't wait to hear how you think it came out. Because we've entertained so much in the past, we had most of this on hand. But I did link some of the new stuff and similar things in my Amazon storefront. And next up is Christmas. Drop your comments below and let me know what you think I should do for our Christmas party. I have a whole month to prepare and order. Thanks, y'all.

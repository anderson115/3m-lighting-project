 Our garage was getting way too messy and we knew we had to do something about it. So we grabbed some 2x4s and the large Costco bins and we built the garage storage wall of our dreams. There is no exaggeration why I tell you this is my new favorite DIY. We use the large, black and yellow Costco bins and I labeled each of them individually, they slide easily in and out of their space and we even added side hooks and hangers for other items. We put a piece of plywood on top for larger pieces or extra rugs. My husband built this frame in 3 days, it is a great DIY for your garage.

 Verage was in desperate need of a little refresh. I feel like it has become so disorganized and truly just like a catch all. First things first is to clean everything out. I'm not joking when I say there are things in quite literally every corner of the scroge. On tools, noils, this bike, this tennis equipment, pretty much everything. Sweeping was truly the most satisfying part. There were seriously so many bugs and so much dust to keep everything organized and super functional. I knew we needed shells. So I obviously ordered these ones from Amazon as well as a bunch of fun bins. Now it's time for the fun part to start organizing. I absolutely love the bins with the lid. It helps to keep all of the dust out and also keeps things looking really sleek. I was also thinking of adding a tennis closet for all of Noils' tennis equipment and possibly a workbench. I feel like it might make the space feel a little bit more complete, but let me know what you think. After putting everything into their respective bins, it was officially time to start putting them on the shelf. I also kept a lot of the bigger items at the top just because there's a lot more space up there. And I added these labels to all of the boxes. So we won't have to take the lids off to know what's inside. And this is the final result. I feel like it turned out so, so good. The space looks and feels 10 times more organized. I will say organizing your garage in a 100 degree weather is not for the weed. But I'm truly so obsessed with how this turned out.

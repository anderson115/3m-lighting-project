 These HDX shells are super easy to assemble, putting these 27 gallon toads in them at fourth levels for those new mini 6.5 quart toads. Super easy to put together, vertical posts in the horizontal platforms, everything's plug and play, no screws required. I do provide those anchor brackets so you can make this secure and tough, excellent shelf.

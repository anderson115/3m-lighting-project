 Here's how much my graduate innovation costs that I did all by myself. We used to have all this open shelving along the back and I wanted to create my own cap. I originally started building with $90 sheets of plywood and quickly determined that was too expensive and started buying the $55 cheaper sheets. I spent about $1,600 in total on lumber for my cabinet boxes, cabinet doors, and all my drawer boxes and fronts. Next up is my 12-foot long countertop. I used a combination of paint and plywood and this cost me about $125. Next up in my process was building all my cabinet doors and drawer fronts. Again, this is already included in the lumber cost initially but I'm guessing each cabinet door cost me about $12 to make in each drawer front cost about eight. My hinges on all my doors cost me $85. In addition to the lumber cost, my drawers cost me $125 for all the slides and pocket screws. Another big take at item were the garage floors that I did. These cost me $850 but $350 of that was a clear coat so that definitely added to the expense. My shelf-lap boards along the back wall, I used six of them, that was $80. Finally was this mud bench that I built. I actually ended up using scraps for this and I only had to buy lumber for the doors so this cost me about $23. There were some additional costs like paint and primer and polyacrylic that cost me $225. All my handles and knobs cost me about $100. And then I'm guessing there was an extra $150 to $200 of miscellaneous things like glue, cocks, grooves, paint tape, those such things. I rounded up and my total comes out to $3500. What do you think was it worth it?

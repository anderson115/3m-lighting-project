 Do you need to have a party this new year's and need a place to have it? Use your garage. I do it every year. I use my garage to entertain my family. I don't really even clean it up. I just kind of push everything to the side and I hide it with the track I got from Roondobattersnow.com and these basic Pankters drop cloth that I got from Lowe's. I don't even think about it. I just make a little puncture hole and I leave the track up all the time and I put the curtains up and down because I actually do park at my garage. So here you see me pulling everything over. This is what it looked like the first year We did it. A lot of people came for me and said the floor needed to be redone because of course it had all things because we Do park there. So last year we did an upgrade and I added RV mats to the floor. So now you can't see the Allstains. Here's the RV mat. I ordered two of them. Put them across the floor and last year it was camp Christmas. I think it turned out absolutely amazing. Everybody loved it. And of course just like every year we have to do a Upgrade. So this year I added a backdrop to The back or actually covering the actual garage door. So you could not see it at all. It was a great place for the kids to take pictures and just kind of set the scene to be like a total Christmas Area and as you see we use space heaters to keep everything warm and every year we just take it up a knot and I'm having a Blessed in the garage. So if you don't have any extra space to have a garage a little creativity you can do it.

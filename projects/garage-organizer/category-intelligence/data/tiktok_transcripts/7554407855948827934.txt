 We took on the challenge of transforming this garage, previously used by the husband as a workshop, into a comfortable and fully functional bedroom, since the family needed one more room in their home. The garage sat at the rear side of the property, making it a gray candidate or a private and quiet retreat. The first step was clearing out all the workshop tools. We then replaced the original garage door with a standard door that still provides access to the rear of the property, making the transition seamless. Next, we upgraded the flooring with dark tiles to create a sleek, durable base for the new bedroom. We also opened up a new window to bring natural light into the space, instantly making it feel more like a true living area rather than its former garage use. For the furnishings, we placed a bed at the center of the room, grounded with a rug underneath. On either side, we added matching nightstands for balance and functionality. Facing the bed, we installed a TV console with a mounted TV above it, and beside the console, we placed an additional small storage unit for extra organization. Because storage was an important priority, we didn't stop there. We added two more matching storage units beside the bed, and installed two tall storage cabinets on the opposite side of the room. This way, the family gains the bedroom they needed without losing the utility that the garage once offered. To finish off the design, we styled the space with a floor plan for a touch of greenery, pendant, and track lighting to brighten the room, and a picture frame hung above the headboard as a focal point. The end result is a functional, stylish bedroom that still preserves practical storage options. What do you think? Would a conversion like this get approved by building authorities in your area?

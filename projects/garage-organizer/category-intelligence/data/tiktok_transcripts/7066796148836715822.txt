 Our garage have a perfect neck for storage shelves, so first I measured the wood in length of the space using a laser measure. Then I went to IKEA's website and under the borer line they have a planner tool. Here you can start by selecting the depth of the shelving. I did 21 inches because I wanted to store large ribbons. You can select the finish as either black or wood veneer. I wanted to keep it simple so I chose black. You can also add shelves to store smaller items as well as pegboards for wall storage, but we didn't have space and didn't need all that so I just left the shelf sizes. Then once you're done, you can scroll down, add to shopping bag and voila!

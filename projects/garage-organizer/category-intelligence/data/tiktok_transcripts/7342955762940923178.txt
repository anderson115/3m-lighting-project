 Welcome to part one of my garage makeover. My plan for today is to build a new shelf so I can get everything off the floor But then I realized how dirty the concrete is from where my cars and parks so I decided to scrub it out I'm thinking I should really invest in a power washer, but this actually worked just fine I then realized how dirty my floor mat was so I vacuumed it and then I realized how gross the door and stairs were So I cleaned that too the pain started peeling off these stairs as soon as I moved in So I'm wondering if anyone has a good suggestion for what to put over the stairs because the paint is just not it I moved everything off the back wall to make space for the new shelves and then I found a chicken bone wrapped up in the dirty blanket My movers used for my white couch the horror story is just never ending here Anyway, some of this stuff belongs inside so I'm moving it there these garage shelves were so heavy you guys I honestly didn't know if I was gonna be able to move them when they were first delivered But a little shimmy and flip did the trick the shelves are actually super simple to put together And I've learned from previous disasters to not tighten any bolts until I'm completely done building just in case I build it wrong and have to take it back apart Also, I'm building adjustable shelving use whatever containers will be stored on it as a guide to how far apart You should place each shelf as you can see over the years I've accumulated multiple different looking bins So I will actually be getting all new matching bins and reorganizing and relabeling all of this I'll be hanging a wall system hooks for all my cleaning tools overhead storage and at some point finishing the walls and floors So stay tuned for part two

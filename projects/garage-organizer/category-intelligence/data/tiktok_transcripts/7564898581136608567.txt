 It's day 10 of deep cleaning my house before my husband gets home from deployment and today we're working on the garage. This is only part of the garage just because I was not able to get this finished. My trash and recycling were both full so it's gonna look a lot worse before it looks better. And go ahead, judge me for the state of this garage. I truly do not care. I hate being in here. This garage is a catch-all and the extent of me being in the garage is me getting in my car and me getting out of the car. There's enough space for me to pull my car in the garage and that's it. I do nothing else in here. But as much as I would love to leave all of this cardboarded here for my husband to cut up when he gets home, I'm gonna be nice. I'm gonna try to be nice and I'm gonna make this neat and at least a little bit more organized. So that way whenever he drops his bags in here, it's not just gonna add to the clusterfuck that's already in here. And it looks really bad just because I have a full broken down dresser in here because my daughter's dresser was completely trashed and my trash can's full. So I have nowhere to put it right now. But I was able to reorganize these black and yellow bins that we have and I think I filled up three of them with just Christmas decorations. So honey, if you see this, I'm so sorry. I know you said you only wanted one bin per holiday but Christmas has three and I'm pretty sure Halloween has two. Sorry. But I just want to head and pile up all of the furniture that needed to be broken down. The furniture that needs to go on marketplace as well as all the recycling that I need to break down and put in the bins once that's empty. And I'm gonna finish the shit tomorrow. So I'll see you guys then. Bye!

 People say I ruined my house. Here's how. This is my garage door. It's exactly like yours and it's boring. But I am about to electrocute. First, I started by sanding down every square inch. I gave it a quick vacuum and wiped it with grease removed. After that, I began taping off all the moving parts and sprayed it with two coats of mat gray paint, along with the walls is attached to. Then I removed the tape and ended up painting the entire ceiling. Now, here's the fun part where we electrify my garage door. I cut a hole in the ceiling and attached a pulley directly onto my garage door track. Then I installed a retractable extension cord inside my attic that feeds directly through the ceiling. I covered the hole with a grommet faceplate and fed the cord through that pulley. Next I attached the end of the extension cord to my garage door and began attaching these super lightweight four feet barena shop lights. The mounting pieces they came with worked perfectly with the pre-existing holes that were already in my garage door pillars. Each end was slightly too short to reach, so I easily attached some small 5 inch aluminum extensions that worked flawless. After this, I attached all 16 lights. This is the part where I plugged them in and see if they work while the door opens and closes. I like to turn on the garage door. I'll be the test subject to see if this shortens the lifespan of my garage door. Do you think I ruined my house?

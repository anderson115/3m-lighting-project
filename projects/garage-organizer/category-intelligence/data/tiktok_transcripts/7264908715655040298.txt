 Tired of tripping over these pesky things in your garage? I can't help you with the cat, but I can help you with the tools. Let's build a wall mounted at your tool organizer. First, lay out your tools and measure across them to figure out what size you need to make this. Check your plowet scraps for something close to the size. Lay this under your tools, then cut some plowet blocks to hang each tool on. Once you've laid this out, how you want it, drill pocket holes into each block and screw these in place. Finally, find a couple of wall studs and secure this organizer to them. Now you're ready to hang up your tools and take back your floor space.

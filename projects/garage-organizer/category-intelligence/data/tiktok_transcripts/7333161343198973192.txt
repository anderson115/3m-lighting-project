 Use the trick to organize your garage and never lose an item in storage again. Start by clearing all shelves and place items in the middle of the garage floor. Sort your items into categories like sports equipment and car cleaning, when placing the items back into the boxes, add an inner box QR code to the front. Name the box, set the location, and save a photo to the inner box app to help you know exactly which items are in which box. Then you can repeat this process to all of your boxes and you can place the boxes back. And then look at how useful this is when you're searching for an item, you just type it into the app, you'll find it straight away with the location and the photo. It is the best storage hack.

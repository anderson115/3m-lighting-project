 If you're having a house built, do not accept this garbage. An overhead mount garage door opener. So instead of having that big long track right here that opens up the garage door that's all we're all used to seeing, ask for the side mount garage door openers. These are lift masters. I have a chain building at my house and they all come with one of these right here. These security features when the door shuts, that bolt goes through and locks the door. Let me know in the comments. Do you like the old way of garage door openers? Or do you prefer the side mount?

 This is my garage. You're probably going to think I'm a freak by the end of this video. This is my flower cabinet. This is where I store all of the seasonal flowers. Here are my wreaths and some of the taller items. This is the Home Decor cabinet. This is where I store all the seasonal Home Decor items. This is my sports and outdoor cabinet. This is my tool cabinet. It's got paint, tools, things to make holes go away. I don't know. This is my craft and party cabinet. It kind of speaks for itself, but I'll give you a closer look. This is my favorite cabinet. This is the cleaning cabinet. This is where I have all of my cleaning refills, so I don't have to go to the store, but I have everything I need right here in this cabinet. We've got a deep freezer and a bunch of water. For all of you who have asked and begged for this, my next video will be What's in my catastrophe closet? So stay tuned.

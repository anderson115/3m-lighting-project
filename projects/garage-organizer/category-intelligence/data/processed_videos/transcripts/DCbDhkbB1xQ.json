  "text": " These 3M Claw drywall hangers are by far the smartest way to hang pictures that I've ever used and I don't think I'm ever going back to any other methods. They are super easy to install. You stick on these templates to make it so that they are in the right spot every time and they even work on these plaster walls. I just use a hammer instead of like drywall where you can push it in with your hands. They work great.",

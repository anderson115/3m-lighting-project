      "description": "Psychological peace can be found in many places; the side of a mountain, the bottom of the ocean, even in your own garage. So, how can a place that holds the most gear, tools, and stuff provide any sense of mental clarity? Thoughtful organization.\n\nSteve likes to keep items handy that make it out on every trip and my workspace tidy. I intentionally build shelves to exactly fit the bins they\u2019re holding, which are specifically selected to best suit their contents. For example, small, stackable, clear plastic containers are great for things like bolts or fishing lures, but larger Rubbermaid bins are more appropriate for waders and ice fishing gear.\n\nLabels are useful to keep track of exactly what you have and know precisely where it\u2019s at. Additionally, organizing your space by activity or season will also help you find what you need so you can spend more time outside and less time looking for that one missing sock.\n#fueledbynature #meateater \n----------------\nCheckout the main MeatEater YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/@MeatEaterTV\n\nCheck out the gear the MeatEater Crew uses in the field here: https://store.themeateater.com\n\nFollow us:\nWeb: https://www.themeateater.com\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/meateater\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StevenRinellaMeatEater",

      "description": "Looking for a way to organize your shop or garage?  April Wilkerson recently shared this variation of a french cleat wall to puts french cleats and pegboard walls to shame.  This french cleat alternative is flexible and attractive.\n\nThe secret is dozens of 45 degree grooves cut in 3/4 inch plywood that receives 1/8 inch metal (in this case aluminum) strips.  Then an opposing 45 degree groove is cut into whatever shelf or tool hanger you want.  With this system, you can move any of your tools or shelves where ever you want.  You don't have to worry about the tear-out so commonly seen in pegboard.\n\nHow I made 222 45-degree rip cuts in 3/4\" cabinet-grade plywood - https://youtu.be/7dms4G6VL4s\n\n1/8\" thick 12 inches long 1 inch wide aluminum strips - https://geni.us/HbFBdWg\nDEWALT 7 1/4\" Corded Circular Saw - https://geni.us/NU1Fut\nRyobi Cordless Brushless Circular Saw - https://geni.us/cFXO\nRyobi Brushless Cordless Mult-Tool - https://geni.us/ABw9S1\nKreg Rip-Cut Circular Saw Guide - https://geni.us/N28T\n3M Worktunes Bluetooth Hearing Protection - https://geni.us/qsh2EVt\n3M Halfpiece Reusable Respirator - https://geni.us/DrSjvK\n3M Respirator Filters - https://geni.us/VZRWq\n\nhttps://amazon.com/shop/FieldGuidetoDIY \n\"As an Amazon Influencer, I earn from qualifying purchases.

In today\u2019s video, I\u2019m sharing a super budget-friendly garage makeover that I started back in September 2024 \u2014 and finally finished! With just under $100, I gave my garage a whole new look with a fresh coat of white paint, added and painted trim, and a much-needed deep clean.\n\nLife gets busy, and sometimes projects take longer than we expect \u2014 and that\u2019s okay. This transformation reminded me that it\u2019s not always about how fast you finish, but about enjoying the process. So if you\u2019ve been putting off a project, give yourself grace. Start where you are, take your time, and soak in the small victories.\n\n\u2728 Thanks for watching, and I hope this inspires you to tackle a space in your home \u2014 even if it takes a little longer than planned.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to like, comment, and subscribe for more budget-friendly DIY content!\n\n#GarageMakeover #BudgetDIY #HomeImprovement #DIYOnABudget #BeforeAndAfter #SlowLiving #ProgressNotPerfection",

      "description": "I\u2019m walking you through it\u2014step by step, one room at a time. This is real-life organizing, not perfection.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works in the kitchen (but this applies to every space):\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Collect \u2013 Remove anything that doesn\u2019t belong in the kitchen. Then gather like with like (utensils, mugs, spices\u2014group it all!)\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Categorize \u2013 See what you truly have. Make it visible.\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Cut Out \u2013 One category at a time, make decluttering decisions. Move quickly, trust your gut, and repeat steps 2 + 3 as you go.\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Contain \u2013 Use the storage you already have to give everything a logical home. Work with your space, not against it.\n\nThe DeclutterCore\u2122 Method is designed to reduce stress, not add to it.\n\n\u2728 Go to my page and download the newest edition of the DeclutterCore\u2122 Kit now.

Ever dreamt of transforming it into a functional room that adds value to your home? Well, stay tuned because in this video, I'm going to unveil how I converted my garage into a practical living space and the complete cost breakdown of the whole project!\nWelcome back to Loving Tech Life and if we\u2019re meeting for the first time I\u2019m David Loving and this is where I share my love of consumer and gaming tech with tips, tutorials and reviews based on my experiences. Today\u2019s video is something a bit different. I'm thrilled to share with you an exciting project that I embarked on recently \u2013 the transformation of my garage into a fully functional room. From the initial planning stages to the final touches, I documented every step of the way, including all the costs involved. So, if you've been considering a garage conversion but weren't sure about the budget, you're in the right place. I\u2019m going share some invaluable tips I learned along the journey and make sure you stick around to the end of the video for the full cost breakdown. If you want to jump to various stages in the video I\u2019ve put timestamps in for everything. With that said let\u2019s get into it!\nA quick disclaimer before we jump into the details, it's important to note that this channel primarily focuses on consumer & gaming tech, not home renovation or building. While I've dabbled in DIY projects and home renovation in the past, I'm far from being a professional in this field. So, if you're expecting expert-level advice, you might be in the wrong place! That said, if you're curious about my experience converting my garage into a room and the costs involved, stick around. I'm sure there are plenty of decisions I've made that could be improved upon, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts and suggestions in the comments below.\nTo begin with let me show you the garage space I had to work with, explain what I wanted to use this space for and the reasons why.",

So factor that down if you don't want this much storage.\n\nNote: I used plywood in my build because I already owned it from previous cabinet projects. Had I bought new materials I would have used 7/16 OSB sheets, which is figured into the cost breakdown below. I did not include the cost of totes. I have owned my totes for years prior to this build as I assume most people have. If you don't already own them, the same 27 gallon totes I am using in this video are $8 each at Home Depot. \n\nBreakdown:\n12' 2x4s (32) - $204\n4x8 7/16\" OSB sheets (5) - $87\n5# box 2.5\" construction screws (1) - $30\n1# box 3.5\" construction screws (1) - $9\n2 packs of composite shims (optional if needed) - $6\nPack of 8 bike hooks - $7\n\n\u2705\ufe0f TOOLS AND SUPPLIES IN THIS VIDEO:\nMiter Saw - https://amzn.to/4lxGMyP\nJobsite Table Saw - https://amzn.to/4ix4j0X\nTrack Saw - https://amzn.to/3S7YxIp\nCentipede Work Holder - https://tsoproducts.com/accessories/bora-centipede-4x8-foot-unit-with-4-x-cups-4-clamps-carry-bag/?ref=MWAWW\nLaser Distance Measure - https://amzn.to/4lAVfKo\nMeasuring Tape - https://amzn.to/45SWnEO\nLaser Level - https://amzn.to/4nBSLgW\nTraditional Level - https://amzn.to/4nx6Ege\nOne Handed Clamp - https://amzn.to/3TQOVme\nComposite Shims - https://amzn.to/4lG2ReR\nPica Pencil - https://amzn.to/44cwOND\nWhite Lead Refill - https://amzn.to/4koy58Z\n*As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases\n\n\u2705\ufe0f HOW TO SUPPORT MY CHANNEL \nJoin my Patreon community: https://patreon.com/MWAWoodworks \nGet Project Plans: https://bit.ly/download-project-plans \nGet some MWA Woodworks Logo Merch: https://www.mwa.keyapparelstore.com/\nSUBSCRIBE : https://www.youtube.com/mwawoodworks?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u2705\ufe0f Other Affiliate Partners \nBits and Bits Co. - 10% OFF using code MWA10 - https://bit.ly/48Pw5Cq \nTSO Products - https://tsoproducts.com/?ref=MWAWW \nTaylor Toolworks - https://lddy.no/1gngh \n\n\u2705\ufe0f MWA WOODWORKS ON SOCIAL \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/mwawoodworks/ \nFacebook: http://fb.com/mwawoodworks \nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/mwawoodworks/\n\n #diy#organization#garage",

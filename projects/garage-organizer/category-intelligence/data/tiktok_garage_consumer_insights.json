We chose the vented garage tiles because they snap together EASILY && gives us the design we wanted ! ⚫️⚪️\n\n✨ The garage door openers are often over looked — but by upgrading that gives you the chance to get one with a camera ! Idk about you but extra security makes me sleep better at night 😴 \n\n✨ Lastly, the garage ready fridge/freezer of EVERYONES dreams ! 💭 you decide if you want it 50/50 or 100% freezer or  100% fridge 🤗 we bought it to have as a large freezer BUT I’d be lying if I said I didn’t like a second fridge space 🤭\n\n🛒 shop easily by clicking the link in my bio 🤎\n\n💛 Follow @alwaysa_kozyhome  as I show off the other side of the garage ! \n\n@loweshomeimprovement #lowesproject #lowespartner #DIY #diyhome ",

Continue the the end. \n6) Add either another corner piece or J piece to finish.\n7) On the the front. The corner pieces were on the outside of the walls. We then lined around the Door with the J pieces.\n8) we then cut the panels to pop them i between the corner and J piece and continued over the top.\n9) for the roof we had a J piece at one end and the other side was against the fascia board. We repeated the same process as the side but with out the corner panels. \n\nIt’s that easy, any questions? Just ask! \n\nDon’t forget to Save for later !! \n\nFull Cost Breakdown\n\n22 Honey Oak - Vox Fronto Slat Wall £830 \n\n3 Vox Fronto Outside Corner Trim £90\n\n4 Vox Fronto J Trim  £51\n\nWooden battens and screws\n£60\n\nTotal 🟰 1031.40 \n\n#garagetransformation #wallcladding #panelling ",

I did some research and found this concrete and garage 1-part epoxy coating paint at Home Depot. It works great! I got it in the color Smoked Tan. \n\nTo prep the floors\n1. I cleared out the garage\n2. I pressured washed the floors and made sure it was clear of any debris/dirt.\n3. Once it dried, I brushed on the paint around the perimeter. \n4. I rolled the paint on to the entire garage floor and let it fully dried before applying the second coat. \n5. As per the instructions, I let it cure for 7 days before I parked my car on it. \n\nIt has been about 5 months now.  There are a few tiny scuff marks  but nothing noticeable. We park our cars on it daily.  \n\n#garagefloors #garagemakeover #garage #garagegoals ",

It’s solid 👌\n\nYou can buy all of these set ups and accessories separately from @Bunnings  or deck out your garage all at once like us. The range is huge so it means if you’ve got one or two of the pieces you can add to them later and design the perfect set up to suit your space and needs.\nTag or send this to your partner if you think they’d love this or you want to hint for your next birthday 🤣👌\n\nI’d love to see your own #pinnaclegaragegoals  use the hashtag to be in with a chance of winning $200 Bunnings vouchers each month!\n\n#garagegoals #garagestorage #garageorganization #dreamgarage #gardenshed #toolorganization #toolstorage #storage #storageideas #storagegoals #mancave #organisation #organisedhome #storagesolutions #storagehacks #tidyhome #australianhomes #australianinteriors #perthhomes #perthlife #toolbox #toolshed #aplaceforeverything #organised #drawerorganization #garagedesign #homedesign #homeinspo ",

It’s solid 👌\n\nYou can buy all of these set ups and accessories separately from @Bunnings  or deck out your garage all at once like us. The range is huge so it means if you’ve got one or two of the pieces you can add to them later and design the perfect set up to suit your space and needs.\nTag or send this to your partner if you think they’d love this or you want to hint for your next birthday 🤣👌\n\nI’d love to see your own #pinnaclegaragegoals  use the hashtag to be in with a chance of winning $200 Bunnings vouchers each month!\n\n#garagegoals #garagestorage #garageorganization #dreamgarage #gardenshed #toolorganization #toolstorage #storage #storageideas #storagegoals #mancave #organisation #organisedhome #storagesolutions #storagehacks #tidyhome #australianhomes #australianinteriors #perthhomes #perthlife #toolbox #toolshed #aplaceforeverything #organised #drawerorganization #garagedesign #homedesign #homeinspo ",

We chose the vented garage tiles because they snap together EASILY && gives us the design we wanted ! ⚫️⚪️\n\n✨ The garage door openers are often over looked — but by upgrading that gives you the chance to get one with a camera ! Idk about you but extra security makes me sleep better at night 😴 \n\n✨ Lastly, the garage ready fridge/freezer of EVERYONES dreams ! 💭 you decide if you want it 50/50 or 100% freezer or  100% fridge 🤗 we bought it to have as a large freezer BUT I’d be lying if I said I didn’t like a second fridge space 🤭\n\n🛒 shop easily by clicking the link in my bio 🤎\n\n💛 Follow @alwaysa_kozyhome  as I show off the other side of the garage ! \n\n@loweshomeimprovement #lowesproject #lowespartner #DIY #diyhome ",

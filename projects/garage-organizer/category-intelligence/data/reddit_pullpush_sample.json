    "body": "I think covering a wall with slatwall sections is a tremendous waste of wall space. If you don't have a lot of stuff, then it makes sense. But in a crowded garage, that wall space is much better served by placing larger tools against the wall, shelving, etc. And small strips of slatwall or just 2x10 and hooks to hang items that are best stored by hanging.",

Even if he wants to tinker with the positioning and storage of some stuff, I can tell you put a lot of thought into the design and layout. It's really easy to get caught up into constantly keeping up with projects and work and not ever getting around to the meta aspects of tool storage, garage design, whatever. All the hooks and hangars to get stuff off the floor, the organization, the extra surface space, the LIGHTING! Dudes LOVE to spend time in the darkest shit-lighting garages. \n\nYou really did something. Great job!",

You'll be amazed how much floor space will be opened up with everything on the walls. So many different hooks and shelves and bins available. Worth the bread.

Looking into a screen system for my garage door so I can hang out and work in there without mosquitoes all over me. There are tons of options.

I think for the back of a workbench, Omniwall is the better choice because it offers much more customization options and has better off-the-shelf solutions for small tools. I've been completely happy with Gearwall for the big wall of my garage. It's great for hanging the ladders, shovels, brooms, large tools, kids bikes, etc... But try to find a good screwdriver or wrench holder for Gearwall and it's a real struggle. You have to look at aftermarket solutions or make your own. I think Gladiator could do a lot more with Gearwall if they'd look beyond hooks, bins, and baskets.",

My biggest challenge was those large footings that bordered the garage. I wanted to maximize space, hense why I went with powdercoated wooden cabinets that hung on the wall and that I could notch. It took some research to decide on how I wanted to set things up and maximize the space.\n\nFor storage solutions, the cabinetry and slatwall were key. I like everything off the floor, so I utilized the wall space to put up slatwall and hang things on it. My tools and other stuff went into the cabinets.\nI also built that floating loft to store stuff in.\n\nCabinets are a game changer but they're not cheap. If I had one suggestion and cabinets weren't in the cards, I'd go and get slatwall along with various hooks and Install that along your walls. It's amazing how much stuff it'll hold. Keeping things off the floor means more room to park and work. It also organizes your space.\n\nThanks again for the kind words and good luck!",

    "body": "1. It looks as if you have access to your attic space from your garage. If this is the case, this is a good spot for seasonal stuff.\n2. Use only one wall for storage. If you use more than one, it will make the space feel smaller/tighter. You mentioned purchasing a workbench, if you do try to incorporate it into wall with the storage. \n3. My preference is to use storage racks but you can go as others have stated with wall mount. I prefer storage racks because they are customizable (adjustable shelves, verticals have places for stuff to go on hooks), hold more weight than you could think of putting on them (shelves tend to be overloaded and under supported), and can be moved around for an optimal fit if you decide you don\u2019t like it\u2019s original location. Also with a wall tie strap, they are safer when, not if, kids wanted to climb them to get something down unassisted. I prefer the husky racks: [4-Tier Husky Rack](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Husky-4-Tier-Industrial-Duty-Steel-Freestanding-Garage-Storage-Shelving-Unit-in-Black-77-in-W-x-78-in-H-x-24-in-D-N2W772478W4B/319132737)\n\nAfter looking over your photos with better detail, I see you have some racks. I would put them a long the wall that hasn\u2019t been painted. I would get a matching rack and put the toolbox between them. This should allow you to space the rack and tower out possibly allowing for weight/dumb bell/kettle bell storage racks between them?\nI like your gym setup btw. If you have more questions I\u2019d be more than happy to answer them for you. I have done the stuff outlined in my garage, I just need to cut down on my projects\u2026.but that\u2019s a whole other discussion. \nAnyways, I hope this helps.",

Baskets, wire shelves, hooks, you name it. \n\nThere ARE noticeable design differences compared to the official ProSlat stuff, namely the official stuff is thicker and beefier, but for all the random little bullshit like spray bottles, rags, etc it\u2019s more than sufficient. Would definitely recommend and their customer service has been stellar the few times I found a cracked weld or something. \n\nThe only thing I haven\u2019t found much support for with them is cabinetry. I wanted a small cabinet for solvents and such and not only do theirs cost exorbitantly more than I\u2019m willing to spend but I haven\u2019t found a 3rd party one that\u2019s compatible. \n\nFortunately, my garage is 20\u2019x20\u2019 and I left about 4\u2019 of space on each side, so I\u2019m just going to buy one and perma-mount it separately in one of those gaps. Probably just go with Husky or some other big box store brand (hey Kirkland, when are you gonna crank out some slatwall stuff?!).",

It's 22ft wide x (just over) 24ft long with 10 ft ceilings. First thing we did was install a 10-foot wide span of floor-to-ceiling Ikea kitchen cabinets: 24-inch deep bases, with counter at 38 inches from floor. 20 inch gap (counter work area) from countertop to bottom of upper cabinets, then 40-inch uppers topped with 30-inch uppers to reach just short of the ceiling. That was great for quite a while, except we needed some wall storage for things like shovels, rakes, weed wacker, etc. At first we just used pegboard. But we found that over time the pegboard we used could not support heavier items. So we put a \"chair rail\" (a birch 1x4 board) at 48 inches from the floor and mounted 4x8 sheets of plain slatwall (MDF with white melamine face) along both sides of the garage at a great price from Diamond Life Gear. Best idea ever. Holds heavy items and can be arranged any way we want it, whereas the pegboard had surprising limitations as far as arrangement of stuff. Used the chair rail as support for the panel when mounting it; made the install very easy. Got various packages of hooks from Amazon and a supplier to retail stores. Check around; there are lots of hook types, and bargains are available.",

The Triton LocBoards are thicker gauge and they are rock solid and dont give at all. I hang some heavy stuff on my boards with zero issues.\n\n\\#3 I really wanted stainless steel and Wall Control didn't have that option either. \n\nI also have Tritons DuraBoards in my basement with their 70000 Series hooks and it is awesome too. It is polypropylene boards and the hooks screw in and bite the poly real nice. It's a killer system with any hook you can think of.

Mix the joint compound with ~25% water to get it like \"runny peanut butter\" consistency. Then simply roll the walls. Shoot for consistency in the way the texture looks and scrape any off the ceiling. Give the texture 3-4 days to dry and then spray the whole garage with gloss exterior white paint. The whole thing will be waterproof and you could even wash a car in there after. The texture will hide all the sh*t drywall work and it looks fantastic. The glossyness of the white paint adds a cool effect also and reflects the light to brighten up the whole space too.\n\nI bought a house where these idiots were hanging yard tools from S-hooks they had punched into the drywall. After a few days of failed patches I'm glad I decided to do the rolled texture route. It was INFINITELY faster and the result was great. The bonus is that even on perfect drywall work you could still never do the gloss paint because it would show every littler imperfection, but with the texture it's not an issue- and if anything it accentuates the look with enough light. Good Luck!!",

Sorry I\u2019m two years late to the party. \n\nCurrently have 20 feet of gladiator gear track and gladiator hooks holding an assortment of shovels, brooms, ladders, string trimmer, stick edger, etc installed in garage but want to hide the mess while not investing into an entire new system of hooks that can hold 3-5 pieces each. \n\nWith that said, I would like to store all of the tools within NewAge pro cabinets. Do you think I would be able to wall mount the Pro but also install the gladiator gear track inside the cabinets on the back of the cabinets?  In other words, screw through the gear track, as well as, cabinet and into studs?  Ideally I would simply buy the 48\u201d cabinets, but it seems they are forever on back order, so I\u2019m good with ordering 36\u201d cabinets. I would just have to cut down the 48\u201d gear tracks to match the cabinets.",

The damage was not from the shipping company, the boxes where just fine. The damage was from the poor bare minimum packaging.\n\nOn all 4 cabinets, the middle shelf is spot welded. The door latch hooks under the lip of the middle shelf. The cabinets flex so much during shipping that the latch bent the shelf lip (breaking the paint) and slipped past the metal shelf.\n\nOne cabinet didn't have solid spot welds on the middle shelf and it was completely detached on one side. I ended up riveting this to fix it.\n\nMost all the cabinets had the absolute bare minimum paint on any surface what wasn't directly visible from the front/sides. The top and back were super sparse. Lots of wrinkles in the sheet metal. Visible ugly spot welds. The metallic trim that runs vertically on the door handles just falls off. Easily remedied with some glue but shouldn't have to.\n\nI had ordered the 36\" cabinets but they sent the 46\" cabinets. I was pretty skeptical that a new set would be much better since all 4 cabinets had a variety of damage. I ended up just keeping the 48\" cabinets because i got more storage for free and i thought returning them would be a PITA and frankly I needed my garage back as i was in the middle of a big project.\n\nWith that said, I really dont know how high your expectations can be at this price point. I think you need to open your wallet if you want quality. I couldn't justify 1k+ per cabinet as a home owner. If I was a daily user of these i would definitely pay for a more quality set.",

I feel like it would force you to keep the area in front of it clean. \n* Used Storage - Most all the storage for my garage came free on CL and what I bought came from Public Surplus from a local college. I was able to pick up 4 full size lockers for $30 which hold all my camping gear, my main set of clubs and my kids other stuff like hockey gear, helmets, etc.",

    "body": "I'm not a paint expert.  I bought a house with a garage from the 80s that was never painted and saw first-hand all the tape peeling from the drywall seams due to years of absorbing all that moisture.  It was a lot more work for me to fix all that than it would have been if someone had just primed the drywall at some earlier point.  When I did it myself I used the 2 gallon bucket of Kilz from Home Depot.  Then I painted the bottom dark gray, the top light gray, and put a strip of gladiator gear track over the ugly seam at 4ft where the drywall pieces came together (I had retaped them, but I'm no expert).  It hid the ugly and is functional.  I put another strip the required distance above that one so that I could hang their cabinets wherever I want and use the hooks for bikes/tools/etc everywhere else.  \nRegardless, a painted garage is so much brighter and feels so much nicer than one that is just unfinished drywall yellowing with age over the years.",

I didn\u2019t want to just hammer in a nail either, cuz I tried that once and my skateboard nearly fell on my foot. For strollers, I\u2019ve used these heavy-duty utility hooks from the hardware store. Just screw them into a beam in your garage and hang the stroller by the handle\u2014super sturdy and no fancy tools needed. IIRC, they only cost me about $5 each, which was pretty price-efficient for my wallet. As for skateboards, I rigged up a DIY wall mount using an L-shaped shelf bracket. Just mount the bracket to the wall and you can rest the skateboard on it. Keeps it nice and snug and looks kinda cool too. I cut a couple pieces of rubber from an old bike tire tube and wrapped them around the ends so the board doesn't scratch or slide off. \n\nAlso, have you checked out those pegboard wall setups? They\u2019re pretty cool for organizing stuff without taking up much floor space. You can customize it with different hooks and pegs to hold everything just right. I found a friend getting rid of theirs, so I got it for cheap, but even new ones aren\u2019t too crazy expensive. It might be overkill for just a stroller and some skateboards now, but they\u2019re super handy once your kid gets bigger and picks up more hobbies. Anyway, hope this helps or gives ya some ideas to play around with. Kinda fun to MacGyver your own little garage system, ya know?",

    "body": "Hooks on the back of cabinet doors.\n\nHanging baskets for fruit and veggies that don't need to be refrigerated.\n\nDepends on your layout, but consider hanging some set of pots/pans and wall-mounting other frequently used utensils.\n\nMake sure your cabinet shelves are at the right height for what they are storing, and/or consider adding another shelf for specific things (like just cans).\n\nConsider installing two layers of pull out drawers in lower cabinets. It tends to better utilize space high in the cabinets.\n\nSome walls are good for nooks. Basically cut out the drywall between two studs and re-finish. There are a lot of YouTube videos.\n\nDepending on your layout, voids underneath or above staircases. Sometimes open shelves, sometimes drawers.\n\nSome rooms look great with a ceiling-level wrap-around shelving.\n\nWall mount TVs. It's easy and opens up more functional space. There are also recessed boxes for flush mounting TVs.\n\nIf you have a washer+dryer, there are some pretty good all-in-one units now that have heat pump and minimal venting requirements. That could free spaces beside or above for shelving or cabinets.\n\nWall-mount everything. Wall-mounted hooks for coats, bags, etc. In your bathroom, wall mount storage above the toilet for supplies. Use tall toilet paper holders.\n\nIf you have a garage, wall mount and ceiling mount everything. There are ceiling hanging metal storage shelves that are easy to add. Wall mounted bike holders. \n\nFinally, simply decluttering and pitching the things you haven't used in X years can go a long way. I cleaned out our pantry recently and it's like a magical amount of space now.\n\nAs for renting, I have always had pretty good luck mounting stuff to walls anyways. I don't cut into drywall, but wall mounting a TV was always fine. Double check your lease about move out conditions, e.g. if all holes need to be filled. Spackling holes is very easy.",

Most of my house looks like people's silverware drawer. My garage is floor to ceiling french cleat with custom hangers, racks, and cubbies for gloves, pest supply chemicals, car chemicals,  power tools, I made a FC cabinet for all my abrasives, a horizontal FC shelf for anything that looks like a screw driver, etc. I know where everything in my garage goes, and it takes up much less real estate. \n\nIn my kitchen, I've converted most of the lower cabinets into full slide drawers. I hate getting low and digging around, so I cut out the shelves,  made drawer boxes, added full length slides, and screwed the door fronts to the drawers. I like making bread, so I have a huge cabinet that stores 5 gallon buckets of fresh wheat and flour. I can move the boxes up and down if I buy a different size container in the future. \n\nIn the bathrooms (Some of these are in small bathroom / linen closets), there's small racks and drawers mounted for makeup, hooks for blow dryers and curling/ flat irons, shelf and bin for razors and attachments, a rack for jewelry, etc. I also have laundry hampers in the bottom of each of those little closets. First aid and medicines are in adjustable hardware boxes, \n\nI have a 4'X8' piece of 3/4\" plywood integrated into the drywall (2X5/8\" with green glue- Plywood textured and painted to match) covered with a ton of hooks (at varying heights) that generally just get used for my pants I wore for a 2 hour meeting that I don't want to wash until I've worn them longer, Sometimes my hats or jackets end up on them. Hat organizer on the back of the hall closet door, robe hooks on the back of all the bathroom doors, Specific spots for TV remotes, I have hoops on my lamps and side tables for my glasses, etc.\n\nEssentially, if it goes in a box / junk drawer, I don't want to use more than once a year. Otherwise, it should have a spot where it lives that fits the item, and how I use or a family member use it. For the record, it also keeps me from buying stuff.",

I wouldn't trust them if they were plastic (I'd be worry about them failing and me falling 10-14' feet.  Just a personal paranoia.  \nSame concern I have with collapsing ladders.",

    "body": "My own two cents...\n\nEveryone (in my experience) eventually winds up turning their garage into some type of living space--whether it's expanding it to make a finished den or bedroom or just using it as a workshop or work out space.  There is going to come some time in the future when you want to be in your garage for an extended period of time and not deal with the heat or cold outside.  In the meantime, you are going to want to put things on the walls of your garage--shelving, hooks, cabinets, etc.\n\nI 100% vote for insulating the walls even if you don't have immediate plans to expand out there because you will someday.  Changing an overhead door from a standard to insulated isn't a huge deal and can be done over a weekend whenever you're ready for that.  Adding a split system for heating and cooling isn't difficult later on when you want it.  But adding wall insulation later is a huge pain in the ass.  If there are options for you to do it now, go for it.  It may be years before you thank yourself, but you will eventually thank yourself for having done that.",

It is on a stand or you can pull the fan out and it has short legs you pull out to convert to a table fan.  Best think is that it has a battery you charge!  Bugs outside where you are hanging out/working?  No problem - bring the fan out.  And it is insane how cold this fan makes your space feel.  It isn't super cheap for a fan, but it is worth it!

We have it set to they lock at 10pm in case we forget to lock them.  \n\nRobotic vacuum that self-empties....need I say more?\n\nBefore I replaced most of the windows downstairs with picture windows, I purchased this gadget from amazon called the Gecko Robot Window cleaner!  AMAZING!  I didn't have much hope that it would work, but it did and was awesome!

    "body": "I did exactly this.  But I built a 3/4 wall separating it from most of the other side and drywalled it.  There was already a post there so I just extended it through; it covers most of the open side.  It gave me more space to hang stuff (and hung my bikes and shelves on the other side), a much better dust barrier, and I ran electrical through it.  Unfortunately my laundry is on that side as well as an access door, so I put up eye hooks in the ceiling and got translucent tarps that I hang from the door around to where the wall is.\n\nDust still gets through, but it's much better.  I'd eventually like to attach the entire thing to the ceiling and have it roll down like curtains when I need it.  I also think that if I use a little duct fan and pipe the air out that it'd create negative pressure to help keep dust out of the rest of the garage.  And, I have dust control - a Wen air scrubber on the ceiling, and a dust extractor with a Dust Deputy, that runs to my table saw, router, and chop saw.",

    "body": "For the ROI, decent interior paint with a good cleaning of random bits of stuff like doorbell cover probably is the best.\n\nAlso replace exterior door gaskets and under door weather stripping.  Easy way to save money and keep pest out.\n\nBlinds, I went with cellular blinds as they offered the most insulation. I would not buy these again if I had kids. They don\u2019t hold up well to rough use. Next time I plan on going with drapes and roller shades. \n\nFlooring, I went with wood plank tile but given the opportunity I would have stuck with glued down vinyl plank or spend more and go with large format tile. I\u2019ve debated epoxy floors as they look nice but I\u2019m worried about people slipping. \n\nI\u2019m not a fan of bare feet on large grout lines and wood look plank tile is notorious for not being flat.  Definitely wouldn\u2019t advise buying.\nIt is durable though.\n\nSpeaking of floors, I think upgrading to decent cordless vacuum with replaceable batteries is a game changer.\n\nIt shaves time off vacuuming. Plus with the right attachment it makes vacuuming your car quick and easy.  \n\nSteam mop, as someone who\u2019ve owned a house with tile floors for years. I wished I got one of these sooner. \n\nNow, I need to add a warning that steam mops aren\u2019t for every floor type.  I would not use on laminate or wood floors. LVP is fine provided your manufacture approves it for the flooring.\n\nIt\u2019s great for frequent cleaning and doesn\u2019t leave a residue. \n\nNot sure where you live or what type of appliances you have but my advice is try to replace them with quieter units.\n\nReplaced my 90s Bosch with entry level Bosch and it\u2019s so much quieter. \n\nIf you have a coil top stove, I would suggest trying a portable induction range.  I tried one for awhile and ended up going with the IKEA one that was sold in their AS-IS section.\n\nIt replaced my portable induction range and air fryer.  Now I do suggest you do some research to make sure it\u2019s a good fit four your home. Someone mentioned pacemakers may not be a good thing around them.   Talk to your healthcare provider if that applies to you prior to buying an induction range.\n\nI love mine,  it\u2019s quicker to heat up, convection option is great and it\u2019s easy to clean.\n\nWhatever you buy for your home, make sure it makes something easier and not harder. You\u2019ll never want to use it if it\u2019s the latter.\n\nI would not buy a LG fridge, I started having issues with it after warranty expired. Not sure what brand I would go with but look up the news on LG trying to force people into arbitration by the fact they open a box.\n\nWire shelving system for closets, laundry room and garage.  I like these for kids rooms as they\u2019re easy to put up and can adjust to kids needs as get older. I would also suggest ditching drawers and going with something like the Jonaxel  wire mesh drawers. They\u2019ll fit a reach in closet and free up floor space . \n\nFor my garage I would go with French cleats running the length of the walls. It would be cheaper and easier to add random hooks and other hanging hardware by adding a French cleat piece.\n\nSpeaking of garage, epoxy floor coat is a good idea. I didn\u2019t install mine but it makes cleaning up after car stuff so easy.  If you do it, add grip material. It\u2019s slick with any moisture.\n\nAbove all regardless of your budget, basic preventative maintenance is the best bang for your buck.  \n\nKnow your home and perform basic maintenance for things like lubricate garage doors, inspection your HVAC system. Be sure to check the condenser drain. \n\nFor HVAC, don\u2019t buy those high spec filters of Amazon. I went with one that wire cutter reviews highly and my hvac had whistle when running because it was straining the system. \n\nGet a separate air purifier and decent filter from big box store. \n\nAlso exercise your water supply spigots every 6 months. I get to replace my washing machine water supply spigots because they leak when closed.  Same issue happened  to my fridge water supply.",

    "body": "You do not want a loft bed.  It absolutely will not work for older people.\n\nMy mom (89) lives in my garage apartment. It was converted before I bought the house.  It has one room about the size of a large bedroom and a large bathroom. Also a small kitchenette with sink and fridge, no stove. She has dementia so she\u2019s not safe with stove or oven.  It also has a sliding door into the back yard and an entrance on the side of the house.\n\nPlumbing is likely to be quite expensive because garages are on slab so it needs to be configured differently, which I found out when I tried to have a washer and dryer put in.  If you can put the bathroom on the house side it will be much cheaper because you can access the pipes through your joint wall. You could raise the bathroom floor for piping, or the plumber can install a waste pump that alleviates the gravity/slab issues and hooks directly into your sewer line.  The cheapest quote I got for that was around $10k US in a moderate to low COL area. My second quote was 20k, at which point I decided not to install a washer.\n\nShe has a mini-split installed for heating and AC, which works well in our moderate climate (Virginia) but also a baseboard heater in the bathroom for really cold days.  Make sure the bathroom and doors are wide enough for a wheelchair\u2014even if she doesn\u2019t use it now it\u2019s possible she will eventually, and it\u2019s way cheaper and easier to do it in the initial build.\n\nThere\u2019s room for a love seat, queen bed, and dresser, and probably a comfy chair (it\u2019s a one-car).  The front where the garage door was is now the back wall of the bathroom, and windows were installed on the back and side walls. She has a small fiberglass shower which also works well\u2014you probably don\u2019t want a tub unless she\u2019s a big tub user because they\u2019re big and lots of older people have mobility issues getting in and out.  The sliding door in back opens right next to my deck and she has her own little deck tha she enjoys back there. That door is very close to my back door so I can go in easily, even in bad weather.\n\nRadiant floor heat would be great. My mom gets cold easily, and we keep her heat set at 74 F, which is way too warm for me but good for her.  Don\u2019t do polished concrete\u2014it\u2019s way too slippery especially when wet.  Falls are a major problem for older people.  Try a textured tile or better, LVP, which is durable, easy to clean (thank me later especially if she becomes incontinent) and safer.\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t want the bed taking up most of the space, consider putting in a Murphy bed that is counterweighted or motorized to open and close with little effort.\n\nIt has worked out well for us.  She has her own space and privacy and so do I, which is a huge bonus for not having an internal door.",

I also have room on the shelves for footwear, accessories and seasonal items. \n\nFor the closet at my front door, I have coat hooks in the back instead of having a clothes rod, so I can hang coats, backpacks, bags or whatever easily. I have a shelf built in the bottom so I can have 2 rows of shoes and boots. And I have the shelf at the top a little lower than standard closets so I can reach it easily, and actually make use of the space. \n\nAnd the closet at my garage entrance has shelves and coat hooks on one side, and the other side is open to hold tall items like a broom, mop &amp; pail, the vacuum, etc. \n\nIt also helps to get rid of any folding doors, and have regular closet doors that open fully and give better access.",

They are really nice and offer customization with the bonus of looking clean. But, budget wise use some scrap wood, screwed across 2 studs and then screw your hangers/hooks into that. Build shelving out of 3 foot cuts of 2x4 and piece together throwaway plywood like my dad did. He built 2 full walls of shelving out of throwaway lumber in the 90's that's solid to this day.",

We just built a 30x40 garage with a 20' door and went with the upgraded opener. It's *really* quiet. We don't really use the smart features very often, but it's great if you forget if you closed the door and can quickly check your phone and close it, if need be.  It wasn't all that expensive either...I don't think ours was more than $600.  Worth every penny though.  You can also get a chain driven smart opener for a little less. We have that on the 9' door.\n\nPower blinds/shades. I don't have them yet because the money tree I planted 10 years ago still hasn't come into bloom yet, but I'll be adding them sooner or later.\n\nIf they like drinking their coffee, or if it's something they often serve for guests, a coffee maker that can be connected directly to a water line (same as what hooks into a fridge for water/ice).  Obviously it would be much easier to have that water line installed during construction.  No more refilling the tank because it does it on its own.\n\nTankless water heater.\n\nSolar panels.\n\nBidets. At an absolute minimum there should be one in the master bath.\n\nDual/multi-zone HVAC. Especially if they're building a multi-story house, but it's not a bad idea, even for a single story home if it's large enough.\n\nThings they should probably avoid:\n\nLandlines.  They're at an age where they still might love their landline, but if they have cellphones and get good reception, landlines just seems like an unnecessary cost. I know it's not much, but I'm cheap like that.  Also helps reduce the clutter of phone lines running through the house and wall jacks in each room.\n\nCentral Vac. Robot vacs are getting really really good. Even if your parents don't want one, there's a HUGE selection of really awesome upright vacs that are smaller and really lightweight that will work every bit as good as a central vac, but you won't need to connect/disconnect it in every room.  Also cuts down on more wiring and those god awful wall ports in every room.\n\nFlorescent lights. No. Just no.",

I also have a bunch of plastic totes and bins for larger items that I stack no more than two high on some shelving I made (stacking over two high makes it annoying to get to the one on the bottom).  Some are just labeled with a simple name like \"Plumbing\" and contain all tools and consumables needed for plumbing jobs and have no other use.  All tools and supplies used for multiple applications either go into a tool box (a big one with lots of drawers) or more plastic boxes labeled \"Adhesives\" or \"Tapes.\"  I try to use the similar categories as Lowe's or Home Depot so it all makes sense and I can find things later.  Tool drawers are categorized roughly by what the tools do: turn it, grab it, cut it, measure it, etc. \n\nI also hung up some peg board and bought lots of pegs/hooks in various sizes.  This helps with long tools that are hard to fit elsewhere.  Anything not moisture or temperature sensitive goes into a shed out back to minimize garage space usage.",

Bathroom remodel was partly for future home value, but that toilet was for me.\n\n  \n\n\nReally like my motion activated light switch in the laundry room and the garage, super nifty. Every other light in my house is a smart light but those ones.\n\n  \n\n\nFirst thing I did when I moved in was add an outlet higher up for mounting the TV and some access boxes for hdmi cords since it was my first house and no landlord can tell me that I can't put holes in the wall (and I like how it looks mounted with everything hidden VS cords everywhere).\n\n  \n\n\nHooks everywhere are great since I have too many hoodies and flannels and I'm always taking them on or off. Started with command hooks to feel out where I actually want them and I'm slowly replacing them with nicer fixtures (which gives me back the command hook to put somewhere else lol).\n\n  \n\n\nThere's mountable motion lights that run on battery that are so nice in closets that make rummaging through storage less frustrating.\n\n  \n\n\nWhen my gf moved in we painted rooms more than just boring white. She did a cool stencil in one room. It's something I probably would've written off as more trouble than it's worth, but having a visually pleasant environment that you know, you *live in* all the time actually surprised me how much homier it makes the place feel in the day to day. We also made a cool set up for our stereo with some of her music inspired art on display with some record holders so we can each show our most recently played vinyl. Little touches like that make me happy and are fun to show to guests.\n\n  \n\n\nI have a fire pit but nowhere to keep it permanently so I want to make a base with lockable caster wheels so I can host a backyard fire easily and move it to the best spot depending on number of guests.\n\n  \n\n\nI wish I was more thoughtful about how I are arranged my closets and storage when I first moved in, things like cubbies and labels. When I first moved in I was single without much stuff and just shoved things away because I had \"so much space to myself\" - its real easy to accumulate crap that way and once the house got fuller and messier, it's now a project to get it organized (but that's probably a never ending task). It'd make it easier to host if I didn't use my kitchen table as additional closet space!",

It\u2019s not protection like conduit, so it couldn\u2019t be used to protect the cable in a garage, but for things like running a cable down a wall that\u2019s framed with 1x3 furring strips.

    "body": "It\u2019s tough to say for certain. You could drill a hole in it to find out. \nIt\u2019s probably not a structural part of the house. In my garage, I screwed a number of furring strips to my ceiling, essentially for the same reason you have here- \n\nThe spacing required for those hooks may not have lined up with the joists behind the drywall. The solution? Affix a piece of lumber that spans multiple joists. Then you can place the hooks wherever you\u2019d like. \n\nIf it is a single piece and held in place with screws, it should be okay to hang 200 lbs off of it. The screws will have a pretty high tensile strength- something greater than 200 lbs, anyway. The only iffy part in my mind is how long the screws are, thus how much they\u2019re biting into the wood of the joists above.\n\nEdit: the more I think about this a 200 lb load with a single point of attachment might be ill-advised depending on the type of fasteners holding the lumber up. I have shelves that hold 180 lbs attached to my ceiling joists with 1/4\u201d lag screws and anchored at four separate locations. Small diameter screws typically used in construction might not cut the mustard.",

It's an open picket fence, so the wind can't grab it well and the privacy fence and garage wall limit the wind anyway, so not so much force there. Yep, the 30\" gate has about a 7.5 to one lever vs a hook located just 4\" from the hinge pins. Still should be good enough.\n\nEdit: the URL typo",

    "body": "\r  \nFirst, do NOT give yourself grief.  You have had 20 years of stress and strain and, speaking as someone who also had a child with similar mental illness, it is EXHAUSTING.  OF course you haven't had time to tend to your house!  \n\nFor me, it helps me to put a list in order, i.e., list out the steps in an order that makes sense (i.e, you might want to do the flooring last); include a general thought about how you would do it.   Then embark on it step by step.  It's like having a road map, I find it super helpful.   \n\nA lot of these are very time-consuming and inconvenient, so you also have to kind of brace yourself, and maybe spread out the more inconveniencing ones.  \n\nAnyway here's a suggested order:\n\n1. Doors-- this is actually really easy, just a matter of hiring a contractor and having him suggest the best doors.  Have him oversee any painting or staining before hanging the doors (hopefully he can do this off site).  Your only decisions are what kind of doors, and if you want a specific kind of doorknob, or which doors you might want locks on.   This will immediately look better, with very little work on your part.   ALSO: you don't even have to do all the doors at the same time, just start with the ones that bug you the most. \n2. Windows and screens.  Use the same contractor.   Pick nice-quality, but standard windows (easy decisions).  Main decision--what kinds of locks?  While you're doing this, add screens to windows you might want to leave open for fresh air.  \n3. Vent covers.  Same contractor.  This one's easy. \n4. New garage doors.  Similarly--this is a job that can take a single day and you'll love the convenience.   Do some due diligence and find a very reliable, highly recommended company.  \n\nNow you've already spruced up a LOT --and your work has mostly been supervising, with a few pretty easy choices to make!  While this is going on, you can be setting yourself up for the next steps:\n\n1. Start doing some looking into how you'd like your bathrooms to look.  There are a LOT of choices to consider.  Do you want a new bathtub/shower?  This is the time to do it.  Do this ONE BATHROOM AT A TIME!!  Look on [houzz.com](https://houzz.com) for ideas and also for the widest selection of fixtures, cabinets, etc.  You may want to subdivide your \"research\": what color tile (this will take a long time!  do you want a contrasting tile; where do you want the contrasting tile; how do you want the floor to look?, do you want niches in the shower/bath wall (YES, and shelves!), what color where, etc); towel racks; lighting fixtures; bathrobe hooks; toilets? (get a Bidet seat, they're fantastic), window treatment (levelor shades? curtain?).   Soaking tub?  Shower only?  Tub/shower fixtures?   Do this a little at a time, like while you're watching TV--you can do a lot of this online.  It can be fun--but make ALL these decisions before you even hire the contractor to oversee all this.  Pro tip: be there &amp; supervising when the tiler puts the tile on.   (We just redid a bathroom, can you tell?)   Decide on your contractor.  Don't start until you have all the fixtures, tiles, etc on hand.   \n2. Same thing with the kitchen--start looking around for what you'd like in the way of cupboards, backsplash, etc. \n3. Okay, now: DO THE FIRST BATHROOM.  Don't do anything else while this is happening, it's really intrusive.  Water turned off, electricity, etc.  Have a contractor oversee and coordinate this.  You will find that you are doing a lot of the supervising, coaxing, and overseeing here, so don't think you're \"not doing anything.\"\n4. Then: fireplace.  Something pleasant.  Hire someone to do this.\n5. Start looking at paint for the inside and outside of the house.  Consider having the inside just be the same neutral color throughout--it makes it easier in choosing, AND in touch-ups.  You'll be getting samples, trying them on the walls, etc.   Do you also want to replace switchplates, etc?\n6. Kitchen cupboards, caulking, and backsplash.   Consider doing this yourself if you're handy, but hopefully by now you have a contractor you like; have them do it. \n7. Brick fireplace.  Again--this might be something you could do yourself, if you're handy, but otherwise, have someone else take care of it. \n8. SECOND BATHROOM. \n9. REST.  Seriously.  Take a month or more off.  Relax, enjoy the new additions and improvements.  Slowly think about paint colors.   Decide.\n10. start thinking about what you want in the way of flooring.  Do the research, check different possibilities out.   Decide.\n11. NOW, do the entire house inside and out painting, baseboards, trim replaced, etc.   Facelift, paint, new trim while they're doing the outside.  I'd have the contractor oversee this and have him get in a painting team, it'll be much quicker that way.   \n12. I think it's best to do the flooring last.  \n13. Last of all, hire a landscaper and have him re-do the back yard.  \n\nAnyway, this is just my two cents.  It kind of spreads out the most intrusive things, gives you time to do the necessary thinking &amp; looking around for the bigger decisions, and makes sense from a practical point of view.  \n\nMy only other suggestion is when you're painting the walls, also decide if you want additional outlets.  Easier than doing it after the walls are all painted.  Get outside outlets, too.  \n\nAnyway I hope this is a helpful start.  Give yourself plenty of time, get some cheap patio furniture, some pretty flowers in a pot, some nice herbs for cooking, and enjoy the outdoors even before it's landscaped!",

    "body": "Sounds like a great idea. You should consider covering the interior with OSB instead of drywall. If it's a functional garage you may want to install a variety of hooks and hangers on the OSB. It's probably more moisture resistant than the drywall. I would leave the ceiling open for storage above the rafters.\n\nI might leave some OSB lying flat on the rafters so you have a surface to store things on. I would hang several shop lights on both sides of the perimeter. Buy a new garage door and a garage door opener. Even if you are young and able to open the door easily now, later on you may wish to be able to push a button from your house to open your garage door even if you're not putting a car inside of it.\n\nOnce you get electricity out there, you may want not only interior lights but also some exterior lights, perhaps on a motion detector. You might want several electrical receptacles. You never know how you will want to use it in the future.\n\nIf there is a window on the current garage, keep it, if not, create one. A very small double hung window is not that expensive and allows for natural sunlight and some ventilation if needed. You could put that small window higher up than usual for security reasons.",

    "body": "A sink faucet that you can pull down and it extends out. They are like $100 (cheaper if you get them on like Facebook yard sale or at reselling stores that sell returned items), you can install them yourself, and are suuuuper useful. We moved into a new house after having one at our old place and we missed it sooo much that it was like something we did within a couple of weeks at the new house.\nTimers on lights. Can be a plug in thing, or a replaced switch. They can be rather cheap and make things so much easier if you just schedule lights.\nRepainting rooms, especially your bedroom. Takes a minute, but painting isn\u2019t super expensive and it makes a huge difference.\nGet a good shower head. If it is newer, and you want more pressure, take it off and look inside the threaded part eighth where you screw it onto the pipe in the wall. We bought a new one and it had a little blue thing that limited the amount of water that could go through it to save water. If you want more pressure, remove/cut that thing out and you will see a massive difference. (Just know, you will use a bit more water)\nHanging accordion storage cubes for closets with just a bar. They are like $10-15 online and you buy them, and hang them by hooks on the bar in your closet. It extends downward and unfolds into 3-4 cube shelves and that adds a lot of utility to the closet.\nIf you have sprinklers, check them to make sure that in any \u2018set\u2019 (meaning, when you turn on one valve, all of the sprinklers that pop up for that valve) all of the sprinklers are the same type of sprinkler. (Fixed spray pop ups, or rotors that rotate back and forth) pop up sprinklers need less time (like 15-20 minutes) to get their area really wet, however rotors need about double that time because they generally cover a larger area. Don\u2019t mix them on the same line or else you will either be under-watering the rotors or over watering the pop ups.\nPaint your garage white! You will be literally floored at how much of a difference it makes. It is even easier if you just bite the bullet when you first move into a house, before you have a chance to hang things or put shelves and tables and such in there. Also paint the ceiling. Then take some lights and point them up at the ceiling to illuminate the entire garage better than any lights on the ceiling. Makes the garage look soooo much bigger and brighter.\nIf you have a crawlspace under the house that you use for storage (not just like dirt, but if it is concrete and such) and you happen to be replacing the carpet in the main house\u2026 cut the carpet into 10\u2019 wide strips and bring them down into the crawlspace and turn the concrete crawl of awfulness into a nice padded area to crawl in and store things. Makes a huuuge difference.",

    "body": "As others have stated, pegboard.  It's the cheapest and most versatile way to go.  Drill holes in the end of wood handled shovels and you can nest and orientate stuff quite well by putting one set of shovels handle side up next another set handle side down.  You can get some pretty long pegboard hooks too so you can stack say all your spade shovels in one spot.  Plus for really heavy stuff you can always run the threaded type hooks into the studs behind the peg board.  You can get some nice pegboard too if you're trying to make your garage/shop look nicer.  I use the cheap stuff in my shed but have nicer metal pegboards called \"Wall Control\" for my work benches.  You can get that stuff in multiple colors and can use slot or hole style hooks.  The wall control stuff is nice too because you can put it on flat walls without have to hang separate spacers which can be a hassle.",

    "body": "Having moved 7 times in my adult life here are my tips.\nStart packing yesterday. Get a U-Haul reservation yesterday. Get way more boxes, moving/newspaper, and tape than you think you'll need. Really large boxes are difficult to lift repeatedly and can fall apart (medium to large boxes are perfect). Go into a room disassemble large furniture place against an empty wall if possible. Put everything in boxes and lable the boxes by room. Once literally everything in the room is packed and in the center of the room close the door. Repeat in every room get down to only the absolute basics ex: kitchen keep however many plates/cups/etc. and a pan you actually need to make basic meals.\n\nWardrobe boxes are great! If you don't want to go that way tape the tops of hangers together, and cover with a large trash bag with the hooks sticking out.\n\nGet a dolly and if you're moving any appliances (washer/dryer or anything large) get an appliance dolly seriously these are worth their weight in gold saving your energy and back.\n\nGet the biggest UHaul you can get. It's always better to have plenty of extra room vs playing Tetris. Stage all the boxes and furniture in an easy area to move to the truck. Garages are great for this, and you can build a load plan by seeing everything in one spot. Load the truck in one swift go, and unload the same way. You can sort the boxes after you return the truck.\n\nIf you have friends or family helping out have everything boxed before they arrive. Having been in the military and constantly having friends moving nothing is worse than showing up and they're still packing or half their crap isn't getting boxed. Their job is to help you move not pack. And of course treat them to pizza and beer after you unload or return the truck.\n\nIf I think of anything else I'll add some edits. Feel free to ask any questions.\n\nEdit: another comment mentioned paper plates and disposable cups that's great advice!",

A stationary TV doesn\u2019t exert a tremendous amount of horizontal pressure. If you have plaster/lathe or crumbling drywall, 100% go for a stud, or if your TV mount includes extension arms. \n\nI have an 86\u201d LG in my basement and it weighs over a 100 lbs. The wall is actually made of plywood (it\u2019s weird, previous owner used the room for batting practice indoors). I didn\u2019t even trust the plywood to hold it so on the opposite side I used a 6\u2019 piece of metal strapping to brace the mount from the opposite side. Every other TV (42\u201d-50\u201d) I\u2019ve used these anchors.",

    "body": "First off, I'm not a professional, I am just a random internet jackass who is probably not a reliable source of advice for this, but here is what I would wind up doing in your case. It will be an inexpensive and not difficult method of fixing it if you dont feel like getting proper under sink mounting and support brackets. And if you have a bit of scrap wood, some clear caulk, and any wood sealant laying around the garage, you dont even need a trip to the hardware store.\n\nI'd get in there with a razor, cut it free, clean up the lip and sand under the counter a bit, layer on some clear silicon caulk, jack it back up into place (I literaly use a small car jack for it with a rag waded on top to keep it from scoring the metal), then measure and cut a 1x2 for each side left and right to properly support and keep it in place in the future, slide them in at an angle, put another smear of caulk on top of the board to make sure it stays in one spot and doesnt slide around later, wedge the top in place, then put a smear of wood glue on the bottom and tap the base with a mallet till it's vertical and at a right angle to the bottom of the cabinet, then stick that in place more permanently with a small L bracket so it doesnt drift out of alignment due to vibration from the garbage disposal or accidental impacts when say wrangling a gallon of bleach from where it's stored shoved all the way in the back because it always ends up in the back for some reason. Then I'd cut another bit of 1x2 and make a cross piece, mount it in there to reinforce the other two and prevent them from bowing later. Then slather the whole H shaped mess in a sealer coat and it should be a hell of a lot more sturdy than the usual under counter mounting clips, and survive long enough to where you either remodel the kitchen completely at that point or sell the place, either way it's no longer an issue.\n\nOn the plus side, you could then put some hooks into that frame to use for hanging packages of brillo pads, spare sponges, or replacement scrub brushes that keeps them off the bottom leaving more room for storing things like soap and other cleaning products you buy, use once, shove down there, and forget they exist, then they get pushed to the back and you buy a fresh bottle next time only to find the old one when you store the new one.",

You could salvage some tile by doing a corner mirror as long as the medicine cabinet is over tile and not in the wall, it needs to be thematically correct so an interior designer would be able to help you here as well. If the medicine cabinet is in the wall there's always tile soap holders and hooks to fill in the two spots that you, again, can match to what you've got and install in those two locations where there's some kissing tiles. trim on the window could use some tidying up in the corners it's more modern than the mosaic but is serviceable if you want to try to salvage it. The floor tile needs to be replaced, but it needs to match the vibe of the room, interior designer needed or someone with some contacts with vintage supplier's. This room has swag, let it be a happy little surprise of unique charm! Don't match it to the rest of the house, let it be a burst of color that you find. \n\nTreat that toilet like it's made of gold, let a pro do the removal and re-install when do the tile replacement. Trying to find a pink toilet is going to be rather difficult. Also you could make a corner vanity go under the sink if the mirror thing works out.

This would give you the option to build a counter underneath them or to even fabricate a rolling setup that could be moved around (or even out of) the garage as necessary.  Going this route, you can also attach some eye hooks to the ceiling and run cables through the eye hooks and the cabinets as an anti-tip safety.  It doesn't have to be super strong, just enough to prevent accidental tipping.  If you put carabiners on the ends of the cables?  Bam.

I would mount rows of heavy duty hooks to hold stuff like the wheelbarrow upright against one wall.

Items that don\u2019t fit in the garage or in the shed I built a couple years ago, go along the sides of the house. \n\nIf im to build some sort of rack system out of wood, im looking at probably 30\u201d+\\- in width just for ease of getting the kayaks in and out.

Then I could do a strap over all of them. For insurance and stability, I could build a rack that they fit into vertically and then secure the narrow rack to the concrete with some Tapcons. I might still have some of those laying around. Hmmm\u2026",

    "body": "We had the same issue, but with a 5-ft tall wrought iron fence. Here's what we did, this was originally written as instructions for a friend.\n\nHi,\n\n\nMore details about string lights.\n\n\nWe used\u00a0Hampton Bay\u00a0(HD brand) for a few reasons -- we wanted warm white lights spaced two feet apart, and wanted LED. Originally I was hoping to buy dimmable but now that we have them hung I realized they're the right brightness and we wouldn't dim them even if we had the option. These are available in 48-foot and 24-foot lengths, and a lot of the other lights I was looking at were only available in a single length. You really need to map and measure where you want to hang your lights and figure out exactly how many feet you want/need before you start selecting lights. (There are places that sell custom lengths, but they were much more expensive.) Also, pay attention to how many lengths of lights can be connected to each other. I think these support\u00a0up to 11 strings daisy-chained together, but we only have 3.\n\n\nI know you likely don't want to attach your lights to poles, but if you do, we followed the instructions in\u00a0this video. I bought 10' black EMT conduit from\u00a0Paramont\u00a0EO. They cost about $6 each and Paramont\u00a0delivers for free! We have the other equipment (drill guide, vise, rasp, etc.) and would be happy to lend it to you. If you try to buy string light poles (ie, with the holes drilled and eye hooks attached) they cost about $150 each, so I was particularly proud that our DIY solution cost less than $150 total for 3 poles -- and most of that cost was for the tools to drill the holes. We used\u00a0duct clamps\u00a0to attach the poles to the fence.\n\n\nOther equipment:\n\nVinyl-coated steel wire: Home Depot sells this, too. You don't need it any thicker than 3/32\"-1/8\" (which I think refers to the width of the wire and the width with the coating)\n\n\nWire clips: We cut a length of wire for each span that crosses the yard. (In other words, we have six separate lengths of wire, not a single wire that zig zags back and forth.) Each length has a loop at each end, and these are what we use to make the loops. Using both the screw clamp and the crimping loops is probably overkill, but we saw it recommended on a few videos. To crimp the crimping loops we used\u00a0this, and would be happy to lend it.\n\n\nTurnbuckles: These are nifty pieces of hardware the extend from 5\" to 7\", and allow you to adjust the tension of your cables once you've hung them. Our neighbor suggested loosening them before winter since the stainless steel cable will contract in winter. Loosening them will give the cables more play.\n\n\nCarabiners: On the side of the yard where we have the poles, the carabiner attaches to the eye-hook on the pole, and the turnbuckle attaches to the carabiner on one end and the wire on the other end.\n\n\nStainless steel chain link: We screwed these onto the gutters to hold the strings.\n\n\nGutter clips: The lights that run the length of the garage are held in place with these plastic clips.\n\n\nZip ties: To attach the light to the wire.\n\n\nHere's what we did:\n\n1. Determine where you want the lights to zigzag and then measure twice! Buy your lights. Remember -- you can't buy 50 feet of lights, for example, and just use 30 feet, so you'll need to find lights that are available in lengths that work for your plan, or you'll need to rework your plan. Your light strings won't be perfectly taut, so I'd suggest you take your measured length and add 5-10% overage. Also, remember that you'll need to have an electrical outlet near the starting point, and take into account the distance from the outlet to where your lights will be hung.\u00a0\n\n\n2. Install the poles (if using), eye hooks or chain links at the points where your lights will zigzag. For convenience purposes, let's call the connection points the north point and the south point, and assume you're going from North 1 to South 1 to North 2 to South 2 etc. It'll make it easier to describe things from here on out.\n\n\n3. Measure the distance for your first span of lights (North 1 to South 1). We added 10\" to that measurement and cut the wire. Create a loop on one end using the screw clamp and crimping loop. Open your turnbuckle so it's fully\u00a0extended (about 7\"). Hook the turnbuckle hook to the wire loop, and then attach the carabiner clip to the round end of the turnbuckle.\u00a0\n\n\n4. Make the loop on the other end and attach the screw clamp and crimping loop -- but don't tighten them/crimp them!\u00a0\n\n\n5. Take the length of wire and attach the carabiner\u00a0to North 1, then take the other end of the wire (the one with the clamps you haven't tightened/crimped) and attach it to South 1. (You'll need a carabiner if you're using eye hooks here.) You can then check to confirm the cable is as taut as you'd like it and adjust as needed before tightening/crimping. (Once you crimp, there's no undoing.) Remember that the turnbuckle will give you the ability to tighten it another couple inches.\n\n\n6. Now attach the lights to the cable using zipties. (It's easier to do this before the bulbs are in.) Hang the first span from North 1 to South 1. Confirm that you're happy with how it's looking before you repeat this process South 1 to North 2, etc.\u00a0\n\n\nThis image is close to what we did:\n\nhttps://www.pinterest.com/pin/77546424807866015/\n\n\nInstead of screw hooks on the left, we're using the chain link since we didn't want to put holes in the gutter. On the right side we used the screw clamp and wire crimp, attached our turnbuckle so the hook goes to the wire look, and the eye goes to a carabiner, which then attaches to the eye hook.",

S-Hooks support the material. Can use chains/ropes as a intermediate between 2 S-Hooks if one needs the material lower for whatever reason.\n\nOne coat of primer and 2 coats of paint shouldn't keep your garage tied up for too long.  I'd say 3 days total if you really want to make sure to do maximum recommened dry/cure time for oil-based.  If water-based then it shouldn't need more than about a day.  4-6 hours between coats is recommended for water-based.\n\nOne can cut corners and the final product will be seemingly unaffected... for a while... but time always tells.  Premature failure due to poor adhesion, improper thickness/consistency, etc...  I always recommend to read and follow directions as closely as possible, particularly if one doesn't deal with the product(s) and technique(s) on a regular basis.\n\nIf there are any grooves or fancy woodworking with the material, might be a good idea to lightly cut those in by hand so you don't get light spots.  ...Or heavy spots if one tries to spray into those tight spots.  \n\nIf it's just flat surfaces then cutting in isn't necesaary.\n\nGood luck.",

Shove deep freeze and fridge over a foot or 2 to make more room between fridge and door. Build bike rack and shove all 4 bikes into this hole behind the door and in between the fridge and the wall.\n4. Take all the tools that were in the spot between the fridge and door and mount them on the wall with hooks.\n5. Build identical shelving as back wall on side wall. Extending over the door and window straight to front wall opening. May need to notch it around the garage door if you want a deeper shelf.\n6. Connect garage door shelving to new top shelf. This deals with the top of the supports on this shelf.\n7. Build bottoms to both shelving units. Make out of treated lumber as it is more likely to get wet at bottom of shelf. Put 3 inches off cement floor. Trim current supports and attach treated pieces to bottom shelves to be new legs. This deals with the bottom of the shelves just being loose 2x4s ready to be kicked out.\n8. Extend bench top all the way under the window. It will be fine at that height. If you really want it at that height just extend it over the window.\n9. Trim door side corner of bench top so it isn't a hard 90* degree corner.

I wanted to minimize cutting and could not do any metal work whatsoever.  I also wasn\u2019t too thrilled with the look of the non-threaded stuff Lowe\u2019s had for sale for this specific purpose.  So I came up with this.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTotal Time:  maybe 10 days off and on.  Mostly curing time for the wood and such.\n * I painted all of the pipes with matte black spray paint.  To make it look nice you need to tape the threads and hang them before you paint.  I used S hooks, washers, twine and screws.  Tie a screw at the end of a string.  Make sure it\u2019s long enough to fish through the pipe, tie a washer at the other end.  Use the S hook to hang it outside for painting and to hang it up in the garage to dry.  I made like 10 strings and did batches.  There\u2019s a lot of pipe to paint.\n * All the holes in the wood need to line up exactly.  Recommend figuring out where the bottom shelf/desk holes need to go then using that as a guide.\n * The shelves are not attached to the floor.  Only to the wall at the top and just below the lowest shelf.  It\u2019s about as stable as it can be while giving maximum shelf space.\n * Spacing for the holes comes from 1 flange, a 4\u201d pipe and a quad.  Twist them together and plop it down on the wood so you have about 1/8\u201d clearance from the top of the flange and the board.  Mark your hole.  If I recall correctly, a 7/8\u201d drill bit is needed so the pipes can get through.\n * The two holes on the outside are about 3.5\u201d from the outside edges.  The pipes in the middle are not centered on the middle shelves, but centered on the top and bottom shelves.  It\u2019ll make the two middle ones seem a bit asymmetric, but you can hardly notice.  See the photos.  This gives you plenty of clearance for the \u2018desk\u2019 section.\n * The center support span is the 24\u201d pipe so that puts the center holes about 12\u201d from either side of center.  I put together that section of pipe and marked it to be safe.\n * Once the holes are drilled you can put the metal together.\n * From the floor up it should go like this:  flange, 4\u201d, T, 18\u201d.  On one side you need a quad at the top and the front gets a T.  Connect both at the top with a 12\u201d.  Join the bottom with 2 6\u201d pipes and a join.  The back of the quad gets a 4\u201d and a flange.\n * The two center ones are flange, 4\u201d, T, 18\u201d, quad.  Out of the front comes a 12\u201d with a 90.  Back gets a 4\u201d and a flange.  Connect the bottom T with the 24\u201d pipe.\n * The desk side gets the 36\u201d pipe for the big gap.\n * The other 3 get 12\u201d pipes and a T.\n * Hopefully it\u2019s rather obvious that the boards rest on top of the Ts and 90 bends.\n * Above the two middle shelves you get another set of 12\u201d pipes and a T.\n * The top gets the 10\u201d, 90 bends into 4\u201d with flange for the top anchors.\n * On the desk side use the 36\u201d, coupler, 2.5\u201d, then T.  Above that gets the 10\u201d, 90, 4\u201d and flange.\n * Out the front of the T\u2019s on each end are 8\u201d pipes with 90\u2019s.  The middle two on top and middle 1 on each middle shelf are 6\u201d pipes with 90s.\n * To secure the front of the shelves you need to sink a bore about 2/3 through the wood with a 1 3/8\u201d Forstner bit then tap the center all the way through with a 5/8\u201d bit.  These holes need to line up with the center of your 90 bend.  The 90\u2019s need to hold up the shelf and leave room to put the 1/2\u201d-3/8\u201d reducers.  Secure those with a ratchet.\n * Get your 1 3/8\u201d dowel and flush cut saw and go to work.  It\u2019s 1 at a time so it\u2019s a bit tedious, but they fit well when complete.\n * Finishing isn\u2019t bad and I **HIGHLY** recommend a dry fit.  Route the edge of your boards and the back holes.  One coat of conditioner, sand then stain.\n * Assemble and enjoy!",

    "body": " Hi I'm David Delgado a visionary and inventor   I have an idea to  convert motorized mountain bikes into a multi-passenger off-road   camper.  I built two motorized bikes per manufacturer's instructions and  completed a 500 km break-in run from April to December 2020  (Approximately 8 months)  The engines are still running just fine.  Reliability based on actual test results are very good.  I did not think  they would last that long. Now, I am a believer.  I connected two bikes with thin walled 3/4 EMT steel conduit.  The  connection type was based on no moments transferred as reactions. I also  included rubber vibration dampers on all connections.  I had to get used to not leaning on turns as you would riding a single  bike. Kinda awkward when you are used to leaning on curves  I thought of adding a top structure to support a water proof canvas tarp  for sun screen and rain protection   Maybe replace the canvas tarp with  fiberglass and use aluminum EMT for additional weight reduction  The all around drop-down curtain could be used as a privacy tent for  showers and more. Could be attached with velcro strips, zippers or hooks    PadLockable storage box could be mounted between the bikes.  Also a  Padlockable tool box could be mounted behind the passenger seat  I created a 3D CAD model layout and drawings in pdf format.  I also  added a multi-passenger back bench on the frame.   Analysis show an 800  lb load capacity with a 2.7 safety factor.  I thought maybe I could tie a  couple of hammocks or more above for good measure.  All things considered this could be a perfect Survival Utility vehicle  just in case the stuff should hit the fan.  Inexpensive, easy to repair  (fix), easy to build, easy to assemble, all standard off-the-shelf  materials, keep-it-simple design, reliable, light-weight and strong, may  be disassembled and stored in the garage, all-in-one cargo carrier,  camper and petal assist motorized vehicle.  Street legal  No license, registration, insurance required  No DMV  visits  No sh\\*t!!  This could be a great project for those with some mechanical ability.",

    "body": "I've never done any diy at all and I'm not handy by any means so I'm here to seek some wisdom from the experienced to get critiques about my heavy bag stand [design](https://imgur.com/a/oxP2Lc4). My main concern about my design is if it can handle the load of heavy punches from someone who is 6ft tall and 250+ lbs(I don't consider myself strong by any means but I think I'm heavy enough). I couldn't find a heavy bag stand that supports 200lbs heavy bag plus minus so I thought of making one. Hanging a 200lbs heavy bag is not an option for me whether it be inside the garage or hanging it on a [outdoor pull up bar](https://www.roguefitness.com/p4-pullup-system) that is mounted on a wall due to my housing restrictions but I do have a space outdoors for a platform to make a heavy bag stand. I'm only considering using 4x4 at this moment so I can minimize the use of counterweights(sand bags) which I will put/hang on or near the corner frame. I'm also thinking of adding a pull up bar so a 4x4 would give me enough space to install it in.\n\n\\- Will my design work?\n\n\\- How would I add triangles or make X frames to my design so I can make it more stable(less shaky) when I land powerful punches? I just can't imagine it in my head how I would drill them on the rectangular side frames that I have. I saw this [power rack](https://www.azdiyguy.com/blog/diy-power-rack) that have triangles to make it more stable but I don't think that will have any effect on horizontal forces when I'm doing hooks or punching from different angles.\n\n\\- Any suggestions on the overall design and materials I'm going to be using? I think I might be able to save some $ if I use 2x4 on the horizontal studs since they're only connecting the three 4x4 except I need to use 4x4 on the one where I'm hanging the heavy bag and installing the pull up bar.\n\nAlso right know I'm considering a triangle corner pergola build which I just found and it's quite similar to what I'm designing.",

    "body": "Having just built my [own set of desks](https://share.icloud.com/photos/0MlAkD3BgH7hNpn1O2O4w6Mnw) from butcher block tops, here are some insights I have.\n\nAccording to [The Sagulator](https://www.woodbin.com/calcs/sagulator/), you can expect sag of about 0.007\" / ft.  If you were building shelves, you would want 0.02\" / ft or less.  I feel confident recommending that no additional bracing or stiffing of the desktop is neccessary and that you only need 4 legs located about 6 inches on-center from the corners.  Make sure to add horizontal spreaders to keep the legs from racking.\n\nThe big desk I made is 48\" x 96\", the two side desks are 24\" x 96\".  I crafted the bases from 2\" black gas pipe.  Each leg is made up of 5 pieces, a flange mounted to the table, an 18\" piece, a tee which ties two legs together, a short 6\" piece, and a cap.  Since all this threads together, it was easy to adjust the length each leg to level the top.\n\nYou could use [Simplified Building Kee Klamps](https://www.simplifiedbuilding.com) in place of the flange and tees, you would then just need one solid piece of pipe for the leg.  I would still keep the threaded cap for a foot as it allows for adjustability. \n\nI didn't drill any holes in the top for wires, previous experience tells me that I usually put them in the wrong place so I've left them out for now.\n\nI added 72\" power strips underneath each desktop for power, I've found this better than two or three power strips.  3 desks with 3 power strips means 9 power cords I'd have to run somewhere.\n\nFor cable management I attached [wire guards](https://www.lightup.com/4ft-led-wire-guard-for-165w-225w-lumegen-linear-high-bays.html) used for shop lights underneath the desktop.  The wire guards just hang on small hooks which give easy access to  wires.  I've found these cages to be the best way to keep wires, and power bricks up and out of sight.\n\nThe butcher block I was working with came from Habitat ReStore and was used in a mechanics workshop.  After power washing the top, I used epoxy to fill all the nicks, gouges and holes.  Even though the desktop looks rough, it is buttery smooth.\n\nFor the finish, I applied coats of boiled linseed oil until the wood stopped soaking it up.  Teak oil would provide better water resistance, but it was about 50\u00b0F in the garage and the teak oil just wouldn't cure.  I lightly sanded between coats with a finish sanding of 1200 grit (IIRC). \n\nI would advise not to use polyurethane or any other film finish. They have a tendency to sit on the surface and flake off after years of use.  With oil, you can sand it down and apply another coat if needed.\n\nI actually had to hire a moving crew to move the big desk from the garage to my office, even without the base attached, the desktop still weighed several hundred pounds.\n\nIt sounds like you have a fun project ahead, be sure to post pictures once you finish.",

    "body": "I find that I've become that horrible thing, a physically weak man. I do a bit of lumberjacking etc but still I've spent too many years in front of a computer. So I installed a chinning bar in my house. But then I discovered that I'm too weak to do even one chinup. So I built a weight machine to work up to the strength level I want to be at.\n\nMy first iteration was to just screw a couple of hooks into the rafters in my garage and hang a couple of pulleys, a cable, and a sack of weights. I put the two pulleys about 36\" apart, and the stroke is about 48\". See figure 1. \n\nThey sell these pulleys online, for garage door openers, about $5 a pair. 1/8\" cable is about $1 or $2 a foot. For the sack I went to a thrift store and selected a used lady's handbag, big, sturdy, and not too wierd. For weight, some barbell weights and then adding whatever's heavy and handy: an old drill motor, a pipe wrench, etc. For the bar, the handle of an old snow shovel. \n\nThe idea is to start with a fairly easy weight and add to it gradually, and also increase the reps up to about 200. More than that takes a lot of time but I can do 200 without getting too bored. \n\nAfter a bit of use, I realized that this could be located upstairs in say the hallway, more convenient; it doesn't need more than a typical ceiling height.\n\nI also discovered that as I lift the sack up and down it starts swinging. It will swing farther and farther until it hits something or I pause and stop it. That's annoying, having to stop every 5 reps or so... the slightest little deviation gets magnified until it smashes something, like a wrecking ball.\n\nI thought about how to cure this. My first idea was some kind of a pole or cable running floor to ceiling, the weight captive somehow, sliding up and down. No easy construction came to mind.\n\nMy next idea was an arrangement with the sack suspended from 3 pulleys in say a 1-foot triangle. See figure 2. It's necessary to have a little triangular yoke, or the cable lengths don't deploy the same and the path of the weight isn't straight up and down.\n\nThen I thought about how to hang 3 pulleys from the hallway ceiling. I don't think the sheetrock would be strong enough to support the hooks. The weight is going to be 100 lb or more when I get stronger. There are ceiling joists but they are spaced 24\" apart. I would need to add some timbers up there. Problem is, the attic space is filthy with blown insulation. I don't know what it is, asbestos I guess, or maybe fiberglass, either way I would hate to have to go up there and work in it.\n\nSo next I began to think in terms of a simple cage to keep the weights from swinging, and also provide a support for the pulley. See figure 3. It's a weight machine! \n\nThe basic idea is a set of vertical 1x2s forming a channel for the weight sack to slide up and down in, or whatever design the weight eventually comes to. These verticals are held in place by horizontals outside of them. Thus if a small child comes along unnoticed while I'm assiduously pumping and sticks their fingers in the cage it won't cut off their fingers. \n\nOne real advantage, it would be easy to move to any other place in the house later.\n\nThe back is a plate of 1/4\" plywood. See figure 4. The verticals and horizontals are 1x2, not the most expensive fine lumber in the store either; just selected out of the regular pile to avoid bad knots and crooked. See figure 5.\n\nI thought of just making a solid plywood box but that would block the view, an open cage allows the feng shooey at the stairs to still work. See figure 6. A plywood box with holes wouldn't be safe for little fingers.\n\nIt was convenient to build the thing right there in the hallway, altho it is sized to be able to carry up/down the stairwell. Figure 7.\n\nFigure 8. The bar is fastened to the cable by having the cable pass around the bar and hooked to itself with a little fitting they sell. Then a couple of turns of nylon rope on either side keeps the bar from sliding out. It can be slid as desired and it will stay put.\n\nFigure 9. The cable has to exit the frame, it was simple to just cut a notch for it.\n\nFigure 10. There is a top plate of the same plywood as the back, only doubled; the pulley is positioned to put the cable right down the center of the cage.\n\nThere's a similar bottom plate, with small feet to rest on the floor without squishing the carpet to a permanent flat area.\n\nFigure 11. The cage has to be anchored to the wall, there are considerable sideways forces. I put a long screw thru the corner into a wall stud. Not completely happy with that, it needs a nice strong lag screw.\n\nLessons learned: The dimensions could be a little smaller. I just guessed at the size of 10.5 x 14.5 inches based on the size of the ladies' purse but it wouldn't be hard to make a box to hold the weights with a smaller footprint. \n\nI got a second weight sack for She Who Must Be Humored as can be seen in figure 5. She saw this thing and immediately decided she wanted to use it also. There's a caribiner to hook up the sacks, easy to switch back and forth. It would be nice to have a taller front access to make changing out the sacks easier. I can just cut out some of the boards to do that, or just keep reaching thru.\n\nFigure 12. I need to round the corners. I have a gash on my head to prove this.\n\nFigure 13 just for fun. \n",

We hung 2x4s on the ceiling about a foot away from each wall and then put hooks in them.  We then hung old carpet from the ceiling to the floor off of the hooks.  Then we put egg cartons on the walls behind that.  This cut all the high end noise from guitars and cymbals and what not.  We also made bass traps out of rolls of carpet and put them in the corners .  It wasn't perfect , but it kept the cops from getting called 20 or so years ago. ",

    "body": "Option 3: Remove floor in its entirety and replace. \n\nYou're not talking about a crazy amount of concrete here, and if you're looking to make it a \" 'nice space', level floor \" ... it's really the best option. Rent a walk behind wet concrete saw, cut the floor into manageable sized pieces, and remove it. If you don't mind renting/operating a few things, it won't take much time at all. In the past, I've done similar projects by cutting the slab into 24\"x24\" pieces, drilling holes to install eye hooks, then using a mini excavator to lift the slab pieces into a dumpster with a chain.\n\nI'm betting that you'll find that there is little to no reinforcement in the concrete, (judging by your description of the section falling) and that the base: 1) Was not properly compacted, 2) Is comprised of fill dirt with decaying organics (leaves, grass, etc) that is leaving voids, 3) non-existent or 4) all of the above.\n\nTear the slab out. Dig out 10\" below desired finished floor height from edge to edge. Dig an additional 8\" around the perimeter of the slab for turndowns. Spread 4\" of #57 or 21A or similar gravel in the area and tamp it down. You can do this by hand with a tamping plate, but you'll spend 1/4 of the time doing it with a rented motorized tamper.\n\nGet enough #4 rebar to make a 16\"x16\" grid of rebar. You can likely get a local rebar supplier to bend the turndowns for you if you purchase the rebar package from them. If you decide to purchase your rebar at Lowes/Depot - you can fairly successfully bend your turndowns with a 1/2\" EMT bender and some patience. Use tie wire at the intersections of your 16x16 grid to hold the rebar in place during the pour. You want your rebar in the lower 1/3 of your pour, so assuming a 6\" slab, you want your rebar held 2\" up from the bottom gravel. You can either use plastic \"chairs\" to get this height, our you can drive rebar into the ground and tie your cage to the rebar at the correct height.\n\nNext, decide what kind of finish you want on the floor, and if it'll be conditioned space. You're going to have to buy/rent some concrete finishing tools, but your finish will tell you which tools you need. A broom finish is the easiest and most forgiving. It's pretty standard to use an air entrained 3000 mix for outdoor/unconditioned space slabs, as long as you're not going for a smooth finish. Many folks connect doing a smooth finish on air entrained concrete to the concrete delaminating after a bit. If you're planning on covering the concrete with carpet/tile, you'll probably want a smooth finish. You're probably only talking about 4-5 CY of concrete unless you have a huge garage, and your local concrete supplier can help you out with concrete selection, and can likely provide names of people who are good concrete finishers if you're not comfortable doing this yourself.\n\nYou say that it's been like this for 15-25 years and nothing drastic has happened. Not saying that anything drastic necessarily WILL happen, but just remember... Nothing has ever happened.... until it did. Maybe nothing will happen for another 25 years. Maybe nothing will happen in 50 years. Maybe the floor will fall 8\" tomorrow.\n\nTL;DR - Unless you can confirm that existing has a good base, rip it out and re-do.",

Half the ushaped bar would be inside the wall on the track and the other half of the ushaped bar would outside of the wall holding the painting.   Hope that makes sense as it's kinda difficult to explain with words.  \n\nI've seen the the retractable painting thing on a yacht before and although impressive, it seemed to me that it would be hard to duplicate.

    "body": "Wherever there's drywall, get yourself some slatwall panels (Proslat, Crownwall, etc) for organization. You'll be amazed how much floor space will be opened up with everything on the walls. So many different hooks and shelves and bins available. Worth the bread. Easy to install if you can handle a drill and a level. \n\nIf you want to hide the cinder block wall, definitely do NOT paint it. Do a lime wash if anything. \n\nI'm also on Long Island. Looking into a screen system for my garage door so I can hang out and work in there without mosquitoes all over me. There are tons of options. Good luck and most importantly, have fun in the process.",

    "body": "Yep this is great advice. Also, you want to make sure your garage doors maintenance is up to date especially the rubber stopper on the bottom of the door, as that will keep your garage protected from pests and the elements. You could also have you door insulated to keep heat in/out. As for the rest of the garage, definitely take everything out and give the floors and walls a good clean, and put a fresh coat of paint. I also really like recommending Slatwall panels for storage and organization, that could also cover the exposed insulation. If you really want to get fancy you could get a nice weight rack and install that by the back wall. That's just the bare minimum but you have a lot of potential here!",

Clean up the windows and maybe repaint the cabinet and place new doors/hinges on it to make it look newer, and clean the concrete.

Thinking 2x 2x8 racks on left side and 2x 4x8 racks on right.  I think if it's all 4x8, it will start to feel really crowded.\n2. what color should I paint it?\n3. What type of floor coating?

What else would you change?\n\nCurrent features:\n\n10' 9\" ceiling\n\nhigh lift garage door\n\n[4 post car lift](https://www.bendpak.com/car-lifts/four-post-lifts/hd-9/) in the future\n\n3x [11,790 Lumens - 90 Watt - 5000 Kelvin - 8 ft.

The installer caulked between the OSB and existing concrete floor. It turned out pretty sweet. I put up some slatwall flush to the top of the curb to cover up any \u201coverspray\u201d from the floor install.

The finish isn\u2019t good and has more \u2018texture\u2019 than id like. I miss my smooth concrete floors. The only reason I coated the concrete was because my floors were shot with too much oils and stains. Secondly I had wood filler in the expansion joints for the concrete which was a big nuisance. So in a fit of frustration I went with the polyaspartic coating. If I had to do it again I would fill the expansion joints with a concrete caulk and polish the concrete floors",

That\u2019s somewhere around $650 for 1/2\u201d at my local Home Depot and there\u2019s a discount for buying that many so it\u2019d actually be less I just don\u2019t know how much less. \n\nI\u2019d estimate 2 boxes of drywall screws would be enough. Probably $50? \n\nDrywall bit for your drill - they come in 4 packs. Around $10. \n\nIf you don\u2019t have a cordless drill, for something like this the Milwaukee M12 driver would do nicely. $200. Worth getting an extra battery or two. Call it $300. \n\nBox cutter + a long straight edge are all you really need to trim it, but if you really want professional looking cut edges, you could snag the Milwaukee M12 oscillating saw for another $200. Or their little cutoff wheel tool for the same. Either would be great. Both would be even better. Let\u2019s ball out and say both. So there\u2019s another $400 or so. \n\nWhat are we up to, $650+$50+$10+$300+$400? So about $1500 (rounded up for tax) in tools and materials. \n\nYou going to do insulation too? Add another few hundred depending on what you get. Rewiring things while you\u2019ve got it down to bare studs isn\u2019t a bad idea either. $140 for 250 ft of 12ga romex at Home Depot should be more than enough. Maybe another $150 for new breakers and a bigger panel box if you need it. \n\nWe\u2019re still not even to $2k yet. Let\u2019s see\u2026\n\nI have no idea how much that lift rental is for the ceiling but probably not much. \n\nBiggest thing is going to be time / labor to DIY. For reference, my garage is about 20x20, and it took me a bit over a week and a half to rip all the old walls and wood shelving out, install some new studs and reinforce old ones as needed, rewire everything including adding new outlets and runs for lighting, foam insulate the studs, install insulation, then drywall, then slatwall over it. It was a fun project and I used exactly the tools I just recommended it came out really nice and clean. \n\nYou\u2019ll also need a level, and either some wood scraps or something like [these air bags](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Winbag-Original-Patented-Air-Wedge-and-Leveling-ToolLifts-up-to-300-lb-2-Pack-E157302/303480393) to level things out as you mount them. \n\nBut yeah. I\u2019d definitely do it myself, buy the tools to have for future projects, and save $8k in the process.",

The builder completely finished the garage with sanded plaster, wood trim, and paint in a plain white color (Benjamin Moore Decorator's White). The original white color is still there above the slatwall. But that plaster just grabbed spider webs, bike wheel dirt, etc. And the cement floor was cold, had some cracks, and was annoying to clean. So I put a plain 1x5 board at chair-rail height, painted the bottom half with a commercial-grade Benjamin Moore paint (Scuff-X Matte, Oxford Gray), and swapped out the cheap Big Box Store pegboard panels for white slatwall from Diamond Life Gear. The BM paint is thick enough to smooth out that sanded finish and it stays much, much cleaner. And the slatwall makes organizing stuff much easier.",

If I\u2019m needing more than 2-3 at a time (rare), I\u2019ll just grab an old cardboard box or something. \n\nAs far as Milwaukee vs DeWalt (and may as well throw Bosch and Makita in as well), they\u2019re both solid quality. Just pick one and stay with it for the battery interchangeability. Look through the full lineups for both and weigh versatility of the line vs cost. I went with Milwaukee because that\u2019s the drill/driver package I happened to buy 12 years ago.",

    "body": "That's a fire wall - framing on top could be a vestige of what was built when or could be someone didn't want to mess up the integrity of the fire wall. \n\nAre you sure the wall is uninsulated? Because otherwise, just rock over it and get in your taping practice. You could make holes, do blown in insulation and rock over - this saves you the hauling of the old drywall as well and you'd end up with 1\" drywall for both fire and sound deadening.\n\nIf you really want to open it up to add insulation be sure to cut the old drywall a good 4\" from the framing on top so you can seam it properly. If you cut it flush to that framing, you'll have a hard time getting it to fire wall standards.\n\nIs it painted green or is it green board? Somebody was worried about moisture... it's a bit odd.\n\nConsider covering it with plywood and French cleats for an awesome garage system. You can consider covering it with slatwall for a nice looking, somewhat awesome garage system, though the load bearing capacity of slatwall can't hold a candle to French cleats.",

I do property/condo management and 95% of water issues we deal with could have been mitigated with floor drains in kitchens, bathrooms and laundry rooms.\n\nStorage is good, but it tends to fill - having limited storage forces you to be selective and stay on top of your storage situation. That said, maximizing your storage - hanging bikes, putting your tools on the wall, having dedicated spaces for things (strongly recommended buying slatwall so you can custom figure) is invaluable.\n\nIf I could redo my own home, I would absolutely work on the entrance to include more storage, a bench, in-floor heating to dry wet shoes and boots, bins for things like gloves and helmets, and make it a proper mudroom.\n\nI would also optimize lighting by installing light wells / skylights. I live on the side of a mountain and the sun doesn't even touch the windows of my house for almost two months a year. Natural light would make a huge difference.",

So between these 3 spaces my garage isn't as cluttered anymore. I'm also notorious for just throwing things away/selling or donating things if I no longer use them. Helps me from collecting and needing to store too many things. But I mean... do you *NEED* 6 motorcycles? Haha. I plan on getting a new bike but I don't think I would have time to ride 2 let alone 6.",

    "body": "I'm in the middle of doing something similar.  Here are my general observations in no particular order:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Insulation helps prevent your garage from getting super super cold, but it along won't make it tolerable on a cold day.  In my climate (Colorado), insulation seemed to help keep the garage over 32 on cold days, but not much warmer than that.  I haven't been through a summer yet, but I expect the results to be comparable.  You'll need a heater and/or AC to make it actually tolerable (depending on your climate).\n2. Insulate your garage door as well.  That's a big source of heat gain/loss.  They make kits for it.  Don't forget to re-tension your door springs after adding the weight.\n3. I'm doing my walls with a combination of slatwalls, OSB, and some aluminum siding.  I kind of like the look of it.  Slatwall is incredibly useful, but pricey.  I like the look of OSB and aluminum siding.  Both are pretty cheap too.\n4. If you expect you'll ever need additional electrical in the future, put wires and junction boxes in the walls now.  Even if you don't have anything to connect them to today, you'll be glad you don't have to tear down the walls later.  Use 12 gauge wires if there's even a remote possibility you'll want 20amp circuits.\n5. Don't forget lighting.",

Based on the thickness and the additional images that you provided, that is highly likely to be a *slatwall* type of panel...\n\n*Slatwall* has been around for decades in one form or another.  A lot of us have likely seen it in stores with different types of adjustable shelving components mounted within those horizontal plows, displaying mostly shoes and such for resale - but sometimes lots of bigger, heavier items, too...\n\nTypically, it IS a sturdy product that \"sits\" on the floor, is anchored to wall structure, and can subsequently hold a decent amount of weight...\n\nIn this instance, though, without knowing how the REST of that decorative fireplace surround and structure are assembled, I couldn't reliably state that the build will hold up...\n\nHOWEVER, and for what it's worth, if this were me doing this work for myself, I would:\n\n[1]  Make sure that the decorative panel is NOT \"hanging\" - that it is firmly resting upon a solid build of *whatever* it is that is constructed beneath it!\n\n[2]  Open up a workable area of that panel approximately \"central to the flatscreen mount\"*** and \"frame\" or \"block\" out an extension that ties the TV mount directly to the actual wall structure behind everything...\n\n[3]  THEN I would mount that flatscreen through the panel and into the added bolstering, which would then fully cover that mod work from all eyes at every angle...\n\n*** \"Flatscreen mounts\" are NOT centralized to the flatscreens, themselves!\n\nAlthough NOT the same thing precisely, I've built similar structures before and currently have an unfinished work of my own - because I always wind up with \"reasons\" to not fully finish these things for myself on a timely basis.  Anyway:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/7PpnQOa.jpg\n\nhttps://imgur.com/XU2DTjI.jpg\n\nHope this helps!",

    "body": "Okay, now we're cooking!\n\nWhat you're looking for is essentially a box, with a lid that will hold position, and folding legs.  In my mind, the hardware (namely the hinges and the mechanism for the folding legs) is the big point on this one.  Lemme try a few suggestions, and you can figure out what kind of budget you need to work with.\n\nFrom the bottom up;\n\nFolding legs:\nYou can find [Banquet Table Legs](http://www.rockler.com/product.cfm?page=759&amp;site=ROCKLER) which is an all inclusive solution.  You can find these at the larger hardware chains like Lowes and Home Depot.  Look near their moulding aisle.  These won't be able to close all the way on such a small table so you'll need to incorporate a strap or something to keep them closed.  If you don't mind waiting for a delivery you can simply order the brackets and attach a piece of wood to work as the leg, as with the [Posi Lock Folding Leg Bracket](http://www.rockler.com/product.cfm?page=5817&amp;site=ROCKLER) or the [Card Table Leg Brackets](http://www.rockler.com/product.cfm?page=758&amp;site=ROCKLER).  These two usually won't be anywhere local, but they do cost less and you should be able to fold things up nice and compact.\n\nThe table itself should be wood or metal.  It could be some kind of plastic, but you'd need to reinforce it to really make that work out.  For the time being I'll assume wood, unless you've got the tools to do a metal one.\n\nThe most basic design would simply be two pieces of wood, hinged, with a short stick set into notches to support the thing.  A step up would be a box with a hinged lid and some kind of locking lid support.  I couldn't find a good one in the Rockler catalog, but [Home Depot has these](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Schlage-Right-Hand-Hinge-Lid-Support-C9220F3-RH/202315143#.UVj4ppNvOsM) (get one for the right and one for the left).  You can sometimes find them 'universal' (left and right) as well.  Another decent option would be a [Storm Door Closer](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Prime-Line-Pneumatic-Screen-and-Storm-Door-Closer-K-5119/100558701#.UVj5ipNvOsM).\n\nAfter that you start thinking about the possibility of giving your desk some deluxe options.  For the bottom lighting I'm guessing you mean a light box as used for making copies like when drafting or animating...  Well, the box stores usually have some inexpensive frosted acrylic.  Cut a big square hole in the lid and run a router through that (or if you don't have a router, glue a piece of wood to the inner edge).  Cut the acrylic to size so that it sets upon the lip you just routed and is even with the top of the desk.  After that you can pop in an LED lighting system underneath.  I'll forgo the detail on this until you decide whether you want to try this.  The acrylic could be screwed to the lip, but I'd probably just putty it into place so I could get in there as needed.\n\nIf you went for the box option you can store some stuff in there, but we're talking deluxe now so maybe consider a drawer that opens on the hinged side of the lid (toward where the artist would be).  It won't be a super efficient drawer with the lid supports and all but it could be useful.  Another possibility is to store your tools inside the box in their own holders with something that would fit into a keyed groove on the front and sides of this table.  If you've evr heard of [\"Slatwall\"](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Gabriel-Logan-3-4-in-x-4-ft-x-8-ft-3-in-OC-Paint-Grade-Slatwall-5-Buy-Pack-13591/203128472?N=as7e#.UVj-k5NvOsM) there are a number of storage boxes, hooks, cups, and more that will work off this.  Even if you don't have a router, you could still build something similar (or just use the slatwall, but in that case you'd need a frame for the box... the slatwall is not very structurally stable).\n\nOnce you start adding these options, the desk starts to get really heavy.  If that is a problem you can save weight by making an aluminum frame and cheap, thin wood for the sides and bottom.  Still need the heavy wood for the lid/drawing surface though.  What the heck, as long as we're making an aluminum frame it's a super easy step to rivet aluminum sheet to the sides and bottom (save a LOT of weight and add a good bit to cost...).\n\nPHEW!\n\nYeah, I do go on.  Hopefully this will give you a few ideas.  Now you can further narrow down what you want based upon cost and skill.  Don't completely knock something if you think it is outside of your skill range.  At the very least I can probably find a youtube video for anything you feel sketchy about trying on your own.  Also, keep asking questions about ANYTHING you are not sure of.  It's better to ask why I recommend a wooden top when you want to go all aluminum rather than making this and finding out that your drawing surface sags because you didn't frame and stiffen the aluminum you are drawing on...\n\nGood luck!\n\nOh, and a P.S., make sure that anything that moves freely on this thing can be latched down.

Store bikes in this area, along with whatever doesn't make it into the shed.\n\n5) Move black storage rack in front of white car, and put workbench where it currently is. Likely also add cabinets to this area.\n\n6) Look to back in the SUV to maximize space closer to the house and allow access to the trunk. Not sure how much my wife will like this maneuver, but worth a shot!\n\nThanks again for getting me \"unstuck\" on this - now time to execute!",

I have an old \\~100 y/o sheep barn on my property that I\u2019m going to steal boards from to do the remaining garage walls with, which will give a similar look.\n\nFor the French cleats, I used a 1/2\u201d birch sheet of plywood painted with a \u201cburn\u201d stain from Minwax. The cleats themselves are 3/4\u201d birch with a few coats of wipe-on poly.\n\nI knew I was going to be getting that exact Husky workbench/tool box so I designed my French cleats around its dimensions and landed the electrical outlets accordingly (I ran all new electrical in the garage too).",

    "body": "French cleats are pretty handy. They sell overpriced aluminum ones if you want to get really fancy. You can use cleats to mount just about anything from tool holders/hangers to cabinets to material storage.\u00a0\n\n\nKitchen cabinets are always welcome. Most the cheap metal ones in big box stores feel to flimsy for my liking. Though, they can look pretty sweet and most people seem to like them.\u00a0\n\n\nSlide out pegboard (or Omni wall) is supper awesome. Had something similar to [this](https://www.compliancesigns.com/pd/5s/perfo-stor-tool-storage-system-51pps83?gs=525.5&amp;utm_term=&amp;utm_campaign=SSS+-+CTC+-+Shopping+-+Smart+-+5S&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;hsa_acc=1231952908&amp;hsa_cam=17657211803&amp;hsa_grp=&amp;hsa_ad=&amp;hsa_src=x&amp;hsa_tgt=&amp;hsa_kw=&amp;hsa_mt=&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwgdayBhBQEiwAXhMxtj9cZiHeVG7rr-kZUULybJu2IoLZ2BpUgRH1yKcVOccNyL0EP3Es-RoCWDQQAvD_BwE) at my old job. It was only like 4 feet tall with some drawers under it. Plan on making something like it later with unistrut and Omni wall.\n\n\nI built some lumber racks from 4x4s and 3/4\" EMT. Black iron would have been better (and x4 the cost). Currently buried under way to much scrap wood, but looks like [this](https://youtu.be/V6xrkN5REko?si=E9LUJxzmk06-igv5). Most the cheap Amazon racks were to tall or to short.\u00a0\n\n\nKinda on topic, but white board is super helpful. Writing check lists, parts needed, frequently repeating measurements during a project, etc. is super helpful.\u00a0",

No reason to hang spare parts in the open either, get a tool chest of your choosing and use the biggest/deepest for spare cassettes and cranks... and any power tools/drivers you haven't used more recently than the last time you used your least used bike....\n\nAdult helmets, particularly downhill helmets (which *likely* don't get donned as you leave the house) could be hung to the far right of the second picture, either on a new French cleat system or with drywall anchors...  \n\nI got one of these [Amazon bike rack with shelf](https://www.amazon.com/Yes4All-Storage-Bicycle-Organizer-Sporting/dp/B0CRBH1JGF/ref=sr_1_3_sspa?c=ts&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.AqU_9BuncTiFmdsH2EF3xBFVpvwSiuVX2UdeQnB2LwUmfXVTTzyB7NRdoCSjmTasbUTmAwPjPY13tEg0XJs0A4hhiF8XLwu5dL58tTVY3i1a36kTu_E3koye8-5yIJ0Spho_W6iyxHmX5dARuP8fdU_476KqeYVmMU9sxHlwT28msSWVPDggdubJ-MTMQOAXuD2Cw03OA0t6mDDforT6_q5AIN2vMQ_22SDniqu2D9a5-KJpysGOVVYs1LhnNOPhOaomFo73sdpHT6OD5poyEVl0VwdK6MdLpAywDnY1Rhc.ol7X0cukMa3fKnaxafdIgYpd9U3Y6Bx_CV23NgmSutc&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=Indoor+Bike+Storage&amp;qid=1716332489&amp;s=outdoor-recreation&amp;sr=1-3-spons&amp;ts_id=3403371&amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&amp;psc=1) for the kids bikes, gloves and helmets.

I\u2019ll put those 10\u2019 doors in, figured 9\u2019 would suffice but I agree I\u2019d rather have more room and not need it. \n\nAs far as the 2 post lifts, they are about 15\u2019 from the doors, I did some quick googling and that\u2019s what I found, the longest thing I\u2019d put on the lift is my crew cab long bed so just wanted to make sure I had room for that. If I can give a few feet back I\u2019d do it. \n\nMy biggest challenge has been trying to figure out a layout that allows me to have a pass through but also doesn\u2019t waste space. The pass through is more of a \u201coh shoot I need to get something big in here\u201d rather than a daily used area. That\u2019s why I figured most tool storage/workbench\u2019s would be in that area on wheels, and only if I needed to pull my trailer through would I then move things out of the way. \n\nThe woodworking room is maybe more like a \u201cself contained\u201d room. I\u2019m not a huge woodworker, most I\u2019ve done is just build tool holders for my French cleat wall. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever really make furniture or bigger, it\u2019s just an area where if I do need to make some cuts, drill out holes etc I can do it and not get sawdust everywhere in the garage. I\u2019ve contemplated whether I even need a true woodworking area or use that room for metal fabrication projects. \n\nI agree I do need to show where I plan on placing my tools/workbenches etc. i figured a tool chest in between the bay doors, and then tall cabinet in the corner by the bay door and wood shop wall. Right now I operate out of a 8\u2019x10\u2019 shed I built next to my carport, so it\u2019s hard to imagine how I will expand tool/storage wise since I know I can make do with a much smaller area.",

An AC does seem like overkill but I really enjoy going out to the shed and screwing around on some project vs sit in the house and watch tv.  I just couldn't go out there and deal with bugs or 90 and humid temps.    \n\n\nAn idea if the ceiling is to low for a ceiling fan maybe on one of the walls you could do a wall mount blade fan to help circulate air.    Another thing I have added to my shed is a dehumidifier with an external hose to drain outside.  I did this cuz i was getting up over 70% humidity in there my table saw top started to rust.  Its waxed and prepped to avoid that now but at that high who knows what else would start to rust.     \n\n\nFor a split mini i love mine for cooling but im not sold on the heat pump part.  I have nat gas in my area so it's dirt cheap to use in the winter.   I have a wifi thermostat on there and the reznor heater can heat the shed from 50 to 65 in about 15 minutes if i have one of the ceiling fans on to help circulate the air.",

That lead to discovering hidden floor damage as well.  It quite frankly sucked big time.  But it\u2019s done (mostly).  I do have a couple of minor trim issues I still need to finish, it was definitely worth it but I learned that no remodel is a quick job and will inevitable take 2-3x longer and cost at least 1.5x the budget. There are several things I\u2019ve learned that I would do differently (like hanging my upper cabinets with a French cleat! So much easier by yourself).

Use many wood screws that are as long as possible without poking out the back side of that wall.\n\nI'm confident in the ability of those 2 items to provide ample strength, assuming the wall material hasn't been weakened.

You can use the toggle bolts above to anchor the wall half of the cleat to the wall (you may want to grab some washers so you can tighten up without going through the screw holes), then you attach the other half to the frame of your mirror.  If you can't attach it to the frame of your mirror due to the type of material on the back, then you could potentially use wire from hook to hook and then hang the wire over the wall half of the french cleat.",

Most of my house looks like people's silverware drawer. My garage is floor to ceiling french cleat with custom hangers, racks, and cubbies for gloves, pest supply chemicals, car chemicals,  power tools, I made a FC cabinet for all my abrasives, a horizontal FC shelf for anything that looks like a screw driver, etc. I know where everything in my garage goes, and it takes up much less real estate. \n\nIn my kitchen, I've converted most of the lower cabinets into full slide drawers. I hate getting low and digging around, so I cut out the shelves,  made drawer boxes, added full length slides, and screwed the door fronts to the drawers. I like making bread, so I have a huge cabinet that stores 5 gallon buckets of fresh wheat and flour. I can move the boxes up and down if I buy a different size container in the future. \n\nIn the bathrooms (Some of these are in small bathroom / linen closets), there's small racks and drawers mounted for makeup, hooks for blow dryers and curling/ flat irons, shelf and bin for razors and attachments, a rack for jewelry, etc. I also have laundry hampers in the bottom of each of those little closets. First aid and medicines are in adjustable hardware boxes, \n\nI have a 4'X8' piece of 3/4\" plywood integrated into the drywall (2X5/8\" with green glue- Plywood textured and painted to match) covered with a ton of hooks (at varying heights) that generally just get used for my pants I wore for a 2 hour meeting that I don't want to wash until I've worn them longer, Sometimes my hats or jackets end up on them. Hat organizer on the back of the hall closet door, robe hooks on the back of all the bathroom doors, Specific spots for TV remotes, I have hoops on my lamps and side tables for my glasses, etc.\n\nEssentially, if it goes in a box / junk drawer, I don't want to use more than once a year. Otherwise, it should have a spot where it lives that fits the item, and how I use or a family member use it. For the record, it also keeps me from buying stuff.",

This will allow you to get more screws into the studs that are available, and will give much more 'pull-away' resistance for the cabinets. If the ends are not on studs, you can add some toggle or Molly bolts (sized and installed correctly) there to firm up the purchase to the drywall. At the cabinet junctions, notch the cabinets instead of the cleat.",

Depending on the cleat you also may have a weird gap behind your cabinets.\n\nYou may be better off going with something like wire shelving or figuring out a solution that uses really good high weight toggle anchors to add support further away from the studs. Or as /u/meowrawr suggested, cutting open the wall and adding some more blocking horizontally. It wouldn't be ideal, but since it'd be behind a cabinet you also wouldn't necessarily have to do a great job patching it up.",

That mirror is probably 1/4\". So when making your frame, you'll want a 1/2\"\u00a0 rabbet depth where the mirror sits into. Put your mirror into the frame then glue it in with mastic.\n\n\nIf the mirror is resting on the backsplash, you can use double sided tape and more mirror mastic to secure it to the wall.\u00a0\n\n\nStay away from silicone. It'll de-silver the mirror if applied to the back of the mirror.",

Or you can just add shims at the bottom until it's level then secure them. Or you can use a little metal end post to and tapcon it to the floor. Or, if they make them small enough, you can use preformed concrete or plastic blocks. Some people even do the back ledger board as a french cleat so they don't fasten anything. Lots of options, but there's nothing wrong with the way you did it.\n\nOne thing I actually would suggest if it's within your budget, is adding a piece of plywood across the back of the workbench wall. That way you can mount anything you want anywhere in that area without worrying about studs, and it'll also act as additional bracing for both the shelves and the garage itself.",

The previous owners had installed 75\" blanket insulation all around the entire basement on 2x2 furring strips, 16\" off the floor. The insulation is directly on the unpainted cinderblock wall. We haven't had moisture or seepage problems; a sump pump runs occasionally when there's a lot of rain (right corner). There's a drain that seems dry around the edge of the basement.\n\nA few questions...\n\n* Should I work around the existing insulation or replace it with foam board?\n* If I were to replace the 2x2s and keep the existing insulation, is that sunk cost?\n* Do you think I should take the time to seal the wall with mastic paint? Just the exposed parts, or the whole thing?\n* If I were to tear it all out and start over, would I need to maintain a gap off the floor?\n* Is polyurethaned OSB safe in a basement, or should I do drywall?\n* Is there another approach I should consider?\n\nThanks in advance, I appreciate your perspective!",

Then came back and using pot holders, pulled the mirror off the wall. Pot holders because the heat from the halogen melted the mastic but it also makes the glass too hot to touch. \n\nIf a halogen isn't available, try a piano wire to saw through it.",

You should be able to lift it straight up from the bottom and it will come off. Basically slide it up the wall 1\u201d or so and it will come loose. I would use 2 people. One to lift it and one to hold it when it comes off.",

# Archive Note: 03_PRODUCT_DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md

**Date:** November 3, 2025
**Status:** ARCHIVED - Not included in category intelligence delivery

## Why This Document Is Archived

The original `03_PRODUCT_DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` was an **internal working document** created during the research process. It contains:

- Specific VHB hook SKU recommendations ($49/$69/$89)
- Detailed Bill of Materials with supplier costs
- 18-month development timeline
- Store rollout plans with Home Depot partnership details

**Why not included in final delivery:**

This level of prescriptive product recommendation does not align with the **category intelligence** mandate. The final deliverable focuses on:

1. **Category-level insights** that guide strategic conversations
2. **Immutable category truths** ("Big Boulders") that constrain innovation decisions
3. **White space analysis** showing unmet consumer needs
4. **One "Outsider's Perspective"** with brand mapping (already provided in OUTSIDER_PERSPECTIVE_BRAND_MAPPING.md)

The prescriptive product roadmap would require deep knowledge of:
- 3M's manufacturing capabilities and constraints
- Internal VHB formulation expertise and IP strategy
- Retailer partnership terms and channel economics
- Brand portfolio strategy across Scotch/Command/Claw
- Supply chain and operational realities

**We explicitly acknowledged we don't know these internal realities well enough to make definitive product recommendations.**

## What Replaced This Document

The final category intelligence delivery includes:

1. **`00_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_5_BIG_BOULDERS.md`** - Five immutable category constraints that determine innovation success/failure

2. **`OUTSIDER_PERSPECTIVE_BRAND_MAPPING.md`** - Brand-specific white space mapping with explicit caveats acknowledging we don't know 3M's business priorities

3. **`01_EXECUTIVE_BRIEFING.md`** (revised) - Category overview with consumer insights, quality gaps, and white space analysis

4. **`02_CATEGORY_INTELLIGENCE_DEEP_DIVE.md`** (revised) - Market structure, competitive landscape, and strategic framework

5. **`APPENDIX_DATA_CITATIONS_AND_AUDIT_TRAIL.md`** - Complete audit trail with calculation methodologies and data sources

## If 3M Wants Product Development Guidance

The OUTSIDER_PERSPECTIVE_BRAND_MAPPING.md document includes illustrative product concepts for each brand with:
- Price ranges based on market acceptance
- Weight capacity requirements from consumer insights
- Installation approaches aligned with brand equities
- **Clear caveats** that these are directional only

Any actual product development roadmap should be created by 3M's internal teams with full knowledge of:
- Technical capabilities and constraints
- Brand strategy and portfolio architecture
- Retailer relationships and channel economics
- Operational and supply chain realities

If you\u2019re just starting out, my advice is to stay far away from this pressed paper: it\u2019s ugly, weak, expensive, frustratingly cumbersome and I, myself, regret ever using it.  Because it has to be anchored away from the wall, you\u2019ll have to trim each section, which takes away hook placement.  If it\u2019s not anchored to the wall right, you\u2019ll get dips as the pegboard will collapse under stress.",

Or, do you have shelves on casters or something like that that occupy the space when you slide both movable tool walls to the left? What am I missing?

    "text": "Hey fantastic idea and good video but as a suggestion Your tightly wrapping power cords of all your corded power tools is damaging to cord ,hanging them by their cord also making them potentially dangerous to use . What happened to a piece of metal if you bend it back and forth in the same place it breaks same with hanging it not designed to carry its own weight indefinitely . Damaged wires in a cord increase resistance meaning your tool may not get its full potential of current or worse catch fire due to heat building up in the wires",

    "text": "i'm posting this 6 months after putting up my peg board. i added an additional bar to the back and attached them vertically so i could put more command strips on them. i think attaching the strips horizontally or cutting them into smaller pieces reduces the load capacity of the strips. \n\nmy peg board is still hanging securely on my wall. it's definitely important to be mindful about how much weight you're adding to the peg board. i use the shelf attachments, which adds a lot of weight by themselves. i only put small plushies and gacha figures on mine. screws may be a stronger/permanent alternative, but this method suits my current needs and situation.",

Pegboard seemed simple, but what they neglect to tell you is that mdf is very susceptible to humidity, living in Eastern Canada 100% humidity is a normal day in summer. As we near the end of the first summer with pegboard walls, it's all warped and drooping depending on the weight of tools, so this winter's project will likely be a French cleat wall!",

    "text": "+Mikel Kd - \"quick fix\"  -- That's pretty misleading as it would only take about 4 minutes more to have put up a sheet of Pegboard, particularly on a wall with wooden studs as opposed to a concrete block garage wall.  Simply nail up some 1x2\" furring strips onto the studs, then use some 3/4\" screws to attach the pegboard to the strips.\n\n$19 for a sheet of pegboard is just too cheap and easy an alternative to use instead.  You end up with:\n\na. More flexible uses: you can quickly move the pegs anywhere as tools change or are added over 32 square feet of storage on just a single sheet\nb. Better use of the wall space: 2x4s waste a ton of wall space by definition if you hang anything other than these full length tools, that's why he only shows them being hung.  So now you can also put all the small but regularly used tools at quick reach, like hammers or even screwdrivers with an inexpensive or even homemade mount for them.\nc. Something that adds resale value to the home instead of looking like it was built by the Beverly Hillbillies.\n\nA single sheet of pegboard would add 5 times the useful storage that this design provides, and for no real effort or time more, and barely much cost difference for a homeowner.",

It's not for everyone tho, I have definitely come to the conclusion that what is the perfect solution for one person is definitely not even applicable for another person. A great example of this is bike storage. For some people, those hoist systems are perfect. For others hooks are perfect. For me, neither are good or optimal or even an option. I also have 7 bikes to hang in a very small space. But again, for someone else, it could not be more perfect",

    "text": "The rolling tool chests have evolved and work very efficiently, for a few key reasons: 1) the drawers are a good size to visually scan, and depth fits a great majority of standard tools. Liners and some internal organizing is all one needs to learn what goes where without over-organizing and wasting space; 2) more small cabinets can fit on top, and drawers are at or below eye level, a real problem for built-in shelving and cabinets over work areas. 3) Most drawers fully extend, and are very strong even loaded with tools. 4) You can move them nearer, or away, from areas, and unlike tray systems, aren't likely to tip over. The metal construction is rigid, but thinner than any wood drawer systems, which are heavy and usually built semi-permanently, demanding a lot of pre-planning design.\n  If your shop is for miscellaneous repair and DIY work, not woodworking, building out a full storage and wall system is impractical and costly, without all the wood tools needed.",

    "text": "\"Enjoy\" your video? No. I found it incredibly depressing. If these are my only realistic options, I'll NEVER get my workshop organized. I've already got my tool density almost a full order of magnitude more dense than yours and still can't seem to efficiently organize: a 19\" bandsaw, 2 bench-grinders, a miter saw, a 7\"x21\" lathe with associated rests, chucks, & vices, a combo disc & belt sander, vacuum cleaner, dust collector,  ultrasonic cleaner, 15 gallon air compressor, an assortment of handheld power tools (Sawzall (2), impact driver (2), cordless drill (2), dremel, heat guns (2), angle grinder (2), portable belt sanders (2)), a collection of clamps, bench vice, a drill press, a full set of hand tools (wrenches (SAE & Metric), sockets (SAE & Metric), ratchets, power bars, torque wrenches, screwdrivers, numerous hammers, allen wrenches, saws, various cutting tools, pliers, tin snips, bolt cutters, riveters, staplers, hot glue guns), propane torches, precision measuring tools (calipers, micrometers, runout gauges + support hardware, levels, squares), taps (SAE & Metric), dies (SAE & Metric), punches, chisels, soldering irons, multimeters, along with all the replaceable cutting/sanding (sandpaper, steel wool, blades, cutting wheels, grinding discs, bandsaw blades, sanding belts & discs, drill bits, razor blades, lathe cutting tools, mill ends, vacuum filters, etc.) consumables. PLUS various raw materials (wood, metal, plastic, wire, rope, screen, nuts, bolts, nails, specialty fasteners, rivets, staples) used to create things. Also, all the lubricants, glues, solvents, & cleaning solutions to support projects. My workspace is 10' by 20'. Two ends can't be used because one is a garage door, & the other is a walkway. Oh, I forgot airless painter, paint, drywall related patch stuff. I'm not including my numerous shovels, picks, pruners, leaf blowers, edgers, hedge trimmers, chainsaws, machetes, rakes, brooms, string trimmers, loppers, sledge hammers, etc., which I have organized into a 1.5'x1.5'x8' space. None of those systems you showed seemingly could accommodate my collection of tools & materials, leaving me depressed. Your demonstration of a broom & shovel wall hanging solution made me laugh. I have over 5X the number of tools in that category you showed I've got it packed into that 1.5'x1.5' space I mentioned. I want to get everything neatly organized. I fix stuff, & I make stuff. I also do my own gardening. I tend to work more with metal than wood, but I have the tools for both. Oh, I also forgot what I call my specialty tools: borescope, lasers, label printers, magnifying glasses, temperature measurement tools, and on and on. Oh, I also have a portapower with dies. When I was a little kid my father told me \"A man has to be able to fix anything.\" I took that to heart. He might have just been joking. Dunno. I was just a kid. I sure as heck can fix way more than he ever could.",

One thing I added which I think is lacking in the vid; I \"doubled\" every lenght of leg with a piece taht sits underneath the shelf it is supporting, like for a window sill in framing, rather than only one piece against the shelf as in the video. As is in the vieo, the screws are the only thing supporting the weight, add load, stress/movement when using the bench or loading/unloading, plus a few years of expanding/retracting wood with the seasons, and I'm afraid everything will start wobbling. I also glued everything on top of screwing, for the same reason.",

    "text": "The top two shelves should have been configured like the work bench 4/8/4 rather than 8/8.   it makes no sense to have two cantilevers meet in  the middle rather than a solid span above the bench with two 4' wide towers on each side. \nBins can be stacked.  The top shelf is not necessary.  And it's omission would allow the header above the bench to be raised  5\" to avoid head bumps.   \nA bench height of 38' to 44\" is more ergonomic for standing work and provides space for two roomy shelves under the bench.\nUsing wall studs for support is efficient provided fasteners shear strength exceeds loads.  Rec 4 1/2\" lag screws.",

    "text": "I very much don't align with the \"pinky knuckle\" advice for bench height. Maybe there's more to consider with torso/arm lengths because if I followed that advice it would have me leaning over an uncomfortable amount even if I were planing 8/4 stock. I can feel my lats engaging just from getting into position to plane at that height. \n\nI'm not saying it's not great advice for most, but if you are oddly proportioned like me (I'm like 25.5\" pant inseam, 6'1\") you might want to really consider starting higher. \n\nI started at 40\", but 38\" is where I landed. I'm considering going another 0.5\" lower, but giving it more time before committing.",

The weakest methods either got replaced or went out of business,  so what the old fart traditionalists know is the combined knowledge of thousands  of craftsmen over as many years... You're gonna have to be exceptionally smart to come up with something better. AND have  about \u00bd a life of experience just to know the effects of the downsides. Including those you don't see in your blind spot. That goes for exceptionally smart people as well. So while our society has advanced thousandfold or more in some areas, other are so simple, yet so complex and interconnected, bound by physics and nature, that in 99.9% of cases, you'll end up straight back with what you tried to run away from or avoid. Because it works. And out of all the millions of alternatives,  that one won. For good reason.",

I bought my first home and said, \"I have a house, I need a workbench!\" Long story short, my top rested on the four corners and not the supports running between the corners, or the middle support I added. When I figured that out, I had to use some plastic shims and now at least the supports are offering support to the top. \ud83d\ude05\n\nI just learned my \"supports\" are actually called \"stretchers\". :D\n\nAND... I used carriage bolts and nuts and I've had to tighten mine too!!!!! \ud83d\ude04  Where were you 4 years ago when I bought my house? Oh, this video was already made, I just didn't know about it. hah  Mine is similar to the half lap joint you're describing. Except I used 2x6s instead of what looks like 4x4s and the stretcher is completely supported by two bolts through the 4x4 leg post. It kind of looks like the image at 18:30, only mine has a bunch of shims. \n\nThis is a fun video!!",

    "text": "My first basic workbench was a sheet of 72x36 plywood sitting on a couple 2x4s across 2 saw horses. Not good, except for assembling, painting, and finishing. My first big bench (in my garage) was a sturdy 2x4 frame with a 3/4 plywood surface screwed on. It sat on 2 Keter workhorse folding workstations. 8 legs made the work bench stable in every direction, it could hold 700 pounds, and it could be folded up and stored easily. The top hangs on the wall of the garage.  When the plywood top gets banged up, flip it over and you have a new surface. When that side gets banged up, it's time for a new sheet. (inexpensive) I have a clamp-on vise that works very well, and can be removed in seconds.",

    "text": "Mr Krueger, I have watched about a dozen of your videos but that promise to \u2018not let those problems happen to you\u201d finally won my clicking suscribe. There were three questions I had in regards to my bench that I wanted answered before I finish my plans and started building, the first was leg joinery I have been debating between a half lap and a laminated mortise and tenon (where the beam for the mortise is made from three laminated 2x4s) I am going with the mortise and tenon option. Second was on bench \u201clength\u201d as you call it (my learning is mostly from drafting so I would call it width and what you called width I\u2019d call depth). Third question was about cross braces as in whether or not I needed them. thanks to your video I have decided the answer is yes at lest for the front and back, currently the bench is 14\u201d deep with a plan to make it 20\u201d in a few months (once I figure out if I am a good shop manager that puts tools away or a chaos gremlin that needs a tool trough.) Most of my past work bench experience is from shop class and carving. You also answered a question I didn\u2019t even know I had which was in regards to a vice. However you are making me second guess my height. I\u2019m 5\u20196, in the past for carving I have worked at 35\u201d and for all the other stuff I\u2019ve worked at kitchen counter height which I hated I was thinking 34-35\u201d for the bench. I think I am still going to start there after all my dad has a circular saw that can take care of the finer tuning, in a perfect world I\u2019d have the money and skill to build a height changing one. But hey that can be a goal.",

I am a new inspiring wood worker and want to build a little work area in my garage. Because I am new I have so many questions. Do you have a video on making a work bench? I can probably build one on my own, but I don't know the ins and outs of what type of helpful features it should have and I'm sure I will over look them. If you don't have a video, do you know of a work bench video you have seen that you like that you can direct me to the video.\n\nThanks for your video and if you have time to answer my question. You have a new subscriber now..",

    "text": "So I am planning on using this design to build the same bench but having it be 6'x12' my thoughts are I will need to do a 3rd row of legs to support the center. If you have any ideas on this let me know. I am planning on giving it a try over the next few evenings after work. I will update as to how it goes.\n\nUpdate. AMAZING WORKBENCH! I did go with different dimensions and I am beyond happy with how it turned out since moving to a new house we have so much garage space it only made sense to make a large table since we end up spending half of our time on the floor building large projects so this will eliminate that! I completed this project in only 5 hours. I only did 6 legs just like in the video, I have yet to add the deck boards for lower storage due to the fact I could only fit so much wood in the jeep. Dimensions I went with:\nTable top: 5.5'x12'\nTable height 38\"\n\nLumber Used:\nTen 2x6x12' (for the table top)\nThree 4x4x12' (legs cut to 36\" and support beams going between legs on the lower half cut to 54\")\nEight 2x4x12' (support for the table to to rest on and going the long way between the legs I also added one more going between the legs the long way down the middle)\nTwo 1x2x12' (for support where the deck boards will rest on)\n\nI still need to go and buy the deck boards for the lower support but what I will need is:\ntwenty four 1-1/4x6x6'",

Also, a demo on how to clean out the notches with the chisel would have been great. Also, why not use a good plywood for the top and shelf? Those top boards don't look flat which will create all kinds of problems for future projects built on that bench. And the plywood will stay flat over time vs. the boards.",

A tip for people doing this, i made a little L shaped jig out of scrap wood to hang over the bottom 2x4, exactly as deep as the deck boards so that when i screwed in the bottom shelf supports i made them tight against my jig so it was exactly as deep as it needed to be. This takes out the making sure your measurements are perfect on every single spot your screw in the 1x1s",

    "text": "Thank you for this video. We moved a few years ago and all my tools were just thrown into the garage. Now that it's warm enough to work outside, I've been trying to organize the garage and set up my tools again. I knew I needed a proper workbench, and since I haven't spent much time building things, I was hoping to find something simple. THIS build checked all the boxes. I made mine 10' long and a few inches taller. It worked out perfectly. Lumber in our small town is way overpriced so I only had to buy some 4x4 and 1 10' 2x4 because I only had 3 @16'. I had some salvaged tongue and groove boards that I used instead of the deck boards. I couldn't believe it when they fit almost perfectly after cutting off the tongue edge for each side of the table. I didn't have to rip any boards. Also my hardware store didn't have 5/16 lag screws at 5\" long so I had to use 3/8. They were a little harder to tighten with my impact (even after predrilling the holes), but everything worked out great. Building this table has really improved my confidence and drastically increased my motivation to get back to work. \n\nThank you very much!",

Wrap a rope around both pulleys, then attach the loop to the hoist, and then you can move the hoist in and out without having to reach over the opening..\nWith a little work you could do a bike chain and motor, and have power for moving the hoist horizontally.  But I doubt most people would need it enough to justify it, just the rope loop for horizontal motion would be simple and do well enough.",

That beam, in particular, should be reinforced with a second attached beam. Although he makes adjustments when he shows the beam nailed and reinforced  this beam  with through bolts. Good work",

This IMO should spread out the weight across the various trusses. .... But I am not positive on this. Let me know if this sounds correct: If you are lifting 1,000 pounds then the weight across 5 trusses should be 200 pounds each???  I am going to try this in my shed. But I did modify my truss with a rafter going across first (extending over the top of the wall plates, hope this is sufficient. I am only planning on lifting maybe 400-600 pounds.  The other thing is there are the clamps around the uni strut, which should help prevent the uni strut channel from spreading.",

I'd call county inspectors or a structural engineer before hanging any lifting system.  The call is free.  Auto body repair and ER visits are not.",

How hard is it really to put a 1 x 2 strip on the sides, top, and bottom, and maybe even in the middle (depending on how big of a sheet) across a wall for a piece of pegboard? Look at my comment below to see what I've said about pegboard. If it was possible to add pictures in the comment section on YouTube, I would have posted some. I guarantee it would completely change a lot of people's minds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReply",

However, my main wall behind the cabinet makers bench uses anything from a nail to elaborate holders for planes and chisels. Much better and less expensive than pegboard.",

I have power tools, hand tools, clamps, supplies and even lumber hanging all the assorted pegboard accessories. I even built a cart 23 years ago for storing 2 x 4's 1x 2's and any scraps with pegboard. People just love to exaggerate how bad they think pegboard is, kind of like in those commercials when the actor overreacts to something that doesn't go right.",

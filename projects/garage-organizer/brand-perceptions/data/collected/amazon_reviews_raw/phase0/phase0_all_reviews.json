I used this to attach a new flag to my mailbox and it has been happily baking in the Texas sun day after day ever since...it'll probably outlast the flag, itself! haha\n\nI have noticed that this tape's bond increases a bit in the first few hours from the time of application, as it begins to chemically bond to the surfaces (in some cases). In other words, it's easier to remove/change if you do so soon after mounting. If you do need to ever remove it, it will take a thin razor blade, Isopropyl alcohol, some twisting/prying/peeling, and lots of patience. Use with caution; it will \"literally rip a chunk out of drywall,\" according to a friend who didn't heed my warnings. haha",

    "review_text": "This is a review of the Scotch-Mount Double Sided Mounting Tape Heavy Duty. It was disappointing.\n\nThe item information in Amazon claims that this product is 'heavy duty' and can be expected to hold up to 30 pounds. Now I realize there are caveats to that statement; saying it holds \"up to\" 30 pounds means it will not hold anything OVER 30 pounds, but it doesn't preclude the fact that it might not hold up anything 3 pounds either. That statement is advertising double-talk.\n\nThey recommend 2 inches of the tape for a 1 pound weight. I needed to attach an item (barely1 pound) to a wall, I used far more than 2 inches of the tape, and it stayed put for a week before it crashed to the ground. Not what I would expect from a Scotch item. Lucky for me, the item didn't vaporize when it hit the pavement, and I reattached it yesterday using screws, which are very unlikely to fall out.\n\nMy verdict: 3 stars.",

I also appreciate that it works on a variety of surfaces\u2014metal, wood, and even textured walls. Plus, when I needed to remove a strip, it came off cleanly without damaging the surface, which is a huge bonus.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a reliable double-sided tape that can handle both indoor and outdoor projects, this product is a must-have.

Nothing slipped or fell.\n\u2022 No Residue or Paint Damage: When I removed the indoor decorations later, the strips came off cleanly\u2014no sticky mess or damage to the paint.\n\u2022 Efficient and Flexible: I was able to cut the strips into smaller pieces and use just a little for each item. You don\u2019t need a full strip for lightweight decor, which makes the pack go a long way.\n\u2022 Used Them for Everything: I was able to hang every single decoration in my house using just one pack. Indoors and outdoors, these strips handled it all.\n\u2022 No Tools, No Holes: A perfect solution if you want to avoid nails or screws.\n\nTips:\n\u2022 Surface Prep Matters: Clean the area before applying to get the best hold.\n\u2022 Use Enough (But Not Too Much): Even a small piece holds well, but for heavier items or outdoor use, a bit of extra support doesn\u2019t hurt.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nThese strips are super reliable, easy to work with, and surprisingly economical. They held strong, left no damage behind, and one pack was all I needed to decorate my entire home. I\u2019ll absolutely be buying these again for future projects!",

I have previously been using another Scotch type double-sided tape with reasonable success and wanted to try this to see if it would be a better bond given the description and what I needed it for.\n\nThese strips are not a value for the money. In order for them to be effective you need to be generous with the number of strips you use for the project. Should you try to skimp, your project will be a failure. I found that I had to use twice as much tape than the previous style of tape I was using. The product description is the exact opposite. The red colored side of the tape is almost impossible to pull off. I will not buy this again nor do I recommend.",

I am unable to comment on that, since I've only been able to use 4\", and my skull is warning me that is not enough.\nAs for sticking to cellophane wrapping, I can't imagine anything better. From trying to cut the cellophane off (don't bother even trying) to trying to roll some out (behaves like silly putty on steroids), the Extreme sticky stuff is in a permanent love affair with the packaging. I tried to entice the sticky rubber stuff, but even my artistic sign, with a promise of a permanent togetherness on the wall, couldn't convince the Extreme sticky stuff to break the bond with the cellophane.

It does a great job at both tasks.\n\nRemoving it is just a matter of getting a fingernail or razor blade under a corner and pulling it off from the side. Please note that when I spot tested it, it came off of metal, plastic, and tile without an issue, but putting it on a painted wall DID cause some damage to the paint. I used it on our painted wall because we're not planning to move, and I have no issue repainting if we ever do. If you're living in an apartment or a temporary situation and want to put something on a painted wall, this may not be the right choice for you.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the packaging is terrible. It comes in a plastic bag, which it sticks to, rather than in a bag made of something like the red liner. Because it's sticky on the side, and because pulling from the side is how such tapes are removed, taking it out of the bag causes some (admittedly minor) damage to the mounting tape. This is just sloppy and shows a lack of attention to detail by the manufacturer.",

After a few days everything was fine, but little by little EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE PICTURES we hung up with this tape FELL and broke. They seemed secured to the wall but one by one they fell done. Now I'm left with broken frames, chipped wall paint, and scratched and dinged up floor borders where the frames hit. I'm really disappointed in the quality of this product and with SCOTCH!",

The sides of the tape roll are so sticky that if you have it just lying around it's going to collect dust, dirt and debris...all of which would be annoying and difficult to pick off.\nThat being said, this is some SERIOUSLY sticky, strong tape. I've used it for hanging some command style hooks on my walls and they're holding up extremely well. None have fallen off so far!\nI'm not sure how easy they are to remove or if they leave any damage because I haven't tried to take any of the hooks down. Will update as needed.\nThis particular package comes with two rolls. At $10 I'd say this is a great value. You can't go wrong!",

A much more practical and effective version of a command strip. So far I\u2019ve used these much as the pictures they have in the listing, for the tools in the garage and they seem to hold well. I am waiting to paint the kids room and will hang up all of their pictures after. There\u2019s one notorious one that I could never hang with a command strip so I\u2019m excited to try it. Will post photos once I get everything up!\n*edited to add* I recently purchased a breakfast nook from Wayfair and I ended up using strips of this tape in between many pieces to help it stay together better...since the construction of the pieces itself were very shoddy.",

First, I arranged the photos how I wanted them. Then I flipped them over and stuch a small square of tape in the center of the back of each photo. Next, I peeled the backing off of the other side of tape and stuck it where I wanted it. It was easy to reposition the photos as needed. It was strong enough to hold the photo. The photo display was for my son\u2018s graduation party. It was easy to reposition the photos, and they did not fall off. This is perfect for indoor use. I do not know how it would hold up in wind or rain. For windy conditions maybe you would do something on each of the four corners of the photos instead. Once the photos were mounted, I was able to easily hang the canvas from a nail on my wall.\nI don\u2019t think I would use this on antique or vintage photos that you want to preserve. All of my photos were printed at Walgreens from my phone.",

Whether I'm hanging lightweight items on my walls that don\u2019t need nails, drywall anchors, or screws, this Scotch-Mount tape gets the job done without a hitch. It's reliable, easy to use, and has become an essential item in my home.\n\nBut be weary! While it\u2019s fantastic for little jobs, don\u2019t expect it to hold up larger items, especially if you're stubborn like me. I tried hanging a bigger piece\u2014out of impatience, not wanting to deal with the necessary wall anchors\u2014and within minutes, I heard a loud crash as it fell from the wall. So, little jobs? YES. Hanging a picture nearly half the size of your wall? NO.\n\nAs I write this, I\u2019m sadly down to about 4-5 inches of tape, holding on to it like a desperate hoarder, but trust me, for smaller tasks, this tape is a total lifesaver. Highly recommend it, but maybe not for your most ambitious hanging projects!",

    "review_text": "I am the worst picture hanger ever! I could never get frames level, equidistant, or in the right spot without leaving several holes in the wall. For years I relied on 3M Command strips, which seemed great until the adhesive started degrading and my glass frames fell, ruining several expensive pieces.\n\nEnter the 3M CLAW Drywall Picture Hangers \u2014 an absolute game-changer! The spot marker feature makes hanging pictures foolproof: attach the marker to the frame, hold it level, press it to the wall, and mark the spot. Then just insert the claw and hang your picture. Every single time, my frames were hung perfectly level, with no extra holes, no frustration, and no do-overs.\n\nThe claws seat securely in drywall or studs, with no need for anchors, and they hold strong \u2014 so much more reliable than adhesive strips. Honestly, these have made picture hanging stress-free and even enjoyable. Highly recommend to anyone who\u2019s ever struggled like me!",

I hang all my heavy art (paintings/wood work) and mirrors with 3M claws or tape, and they never budge, even when I bump into them. The quality is insane, and the engineering is just *chef's kiss*. As an engineer, I love not having to drill and just being able to push them in. Okay, sometimes they're not the easiest to push, but a little tap with a hammer (saves you from sore thumbs) gets them going, and then you can hang stuff without worrying! I've used these for years and tell everyone about them when they move. Thanks, 3M!",

So far, they are holding tight and I didn't have to use studs or hang them in awkward places. They are sturdy and a good price. I took off one star because I can't just \"push\" them into the wall with fingers as instructed. I used a rubber mallet which can bend the hanger part toward the wall, defeating the purpose. I found a way to make it work, but I hope the Claw folks figure out how to use tools in the next evolution of this product.",

I appreciate that they can hold a decent amount of weight, making them suitable for heavier items, such as mirrors or large art pieces. This feature is especially useful for anyone looking to decorate their space or utilize the wall space. They are quite expensive, hence taking away one star.",

For years I relied on 3M Command strips, which seemed great until the adhesive started degrading and my glass frames fell, ruining several expensive pieces.\n\nEnter the 3M CLAW Drywall Picture Hangers \u2014 an absolute game-changer! The spot marker feature makes hanging pictures foolproof: attach the marker to the frame, hold it level, press it to the wall, and mark the spot. Then just insert the claw and hang your picture. Every single time, my frames were hung perfectly level, with no extra holes, no frustration, and no do-overs.\n\nThe claws seat securely in drywall or studs, with no need for anchors, and they hold strong \u2014 so much more reliable than adhesive strips. Honestly, these have made picture hanging stress-free and even enjoyable. Highly recommend to anyone who\u2019s ever struggled like me!",

As an engineer, I love not having to drill and just being able to push them in. Okay, sometimes they're not the easiest to push, but a little tap with a hammer (saves you from sore thumbs) gets them going, and then you can hang stuff without worrying! I've used these for years and tell everyone about them when they move. Thanks, 3M!",

So far, they are holding tight and I didn't have to use studs or hang them in awkward places. They are sturdy and a good price. I took off one star because I can't just \"push\" them into the wall with fingers as instructed. I used a rubber mallet which can bend the hanger part toward the wall, defeating the purpose. I found a way to make it work, but I hope the Claw folks figure out how to use tools in the next evolution of this product.",

I searched for a solution and found the claw. I didn\u2019t believe this would work but the reviews convinced me to try. IT WORKED! I made sure we bought the appropriate weight capacity and amazed at how well these work.\n\nIf you have a wall but not sure what\u2019s behind it these will work!

My 3 year old one-brain-celled cat, Nugget, has absolute BEEF with this photo for some reason (my working theory is that he finds the painting of the white cat in the photo either alluring or unsettling). Every. Single. Day. Without fail. Multiple times a day. He is able to stand up on his hind feet to hook his claws between the frame and the glass, and pull the frame OUT FROM THE WALL, at a 45 degree angle, meowing like he\u2019s possessed by a demon (but in the tiniest, cutest voice imaginable, his little voice sounds like an angel singing hallelujah???) which makes the contrast of his roaring at my photo very startling. He has NEVER managed to pull it down, these claws have been tested by Nugget\u2019s claws, and they HOLD UP. 10/10 will be buying these again for every picture I need to hang.

It isn\u2019t really heavy, but the backing is metal, so I weighed the wall art to see which claw to use. My art piece is a little over 5 lbs. For some reason I was hesitant to use the 15 lbs claws so I used two of the 25 claws instead. I liked the convenience of just pressing into the wall, but you have to push SO, SO hard to actually get it in the wall. I\u2019m in decent shape and I even had to stop and shake my wrists and really push with my whole body weight to get them in. All this to say, the convenience of push and hang is nice, but these are not for someone with muscle weakness or maybe even arthritis. I am a bit concerned how this will hold up long term. Once installed, the claw was flush with the wall, but after I hung my art I peaked behind the woven art and it seems to me that the claw is ever so slightly forward now and no longer completely flush. I understand that my art kinda juts out a smidge, but considering that it weights a little over 5 lbs and I used two 25 lb claws, I\u2019m just concerned this won\u2019t be a long term solution.",

I\u2019ve been a ride or die command strip supporter for decades now, but our current apartment hates them. As in, the paint absolutely sucks and is just so low quality that the command strips don\u2019t always last long. Plus, we have neighbors that literally shake the walls and have multiple instances of flooding through the ceiling, both of which aren\u2019t command-strip friendly.\n\nWe started using these and are basically switching to them for everything. The cleanup after removal is way more discrete than command strips, because with these youll have a couple of teeny tiny holes to fill in. With the command strips, if they don\u2019t come off cleanly, you have to either cover missing paint or a deep chunk of missing drywall.\n\nWe\u2019ve hung up stuffed animal baskets with these, lightweight signs, heavy signs and lights, a coffee mug rack, and I trust them for use up high on walls or over other fixtures and furniture. These books are also incredibly easy to install, if anything you\u2019ll just need something with some weight (hammer, can of soup, a shoe\u2026) to help drive the hook into the wall, but it\u2019s very quick and I think most anybody with some upper body ability would be able to handle it themselves. Removal is a little trickier, you\u2019ll need something to wedge under the hook to pop it out, but it takes seconds, and the hook is completely reusable.",

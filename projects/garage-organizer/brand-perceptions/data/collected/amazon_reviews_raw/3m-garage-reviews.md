5.0 out of 5 stars Good for pedal board mounting.
Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2025
Style: 1 PackSize: 1"×8ftVerified Purchase
This is about pedal board mounting. I like this better than hook and loop, to me it’s sturdier, I can use a bit less, and it works with Velcro if it’s already on a pedal. XTS uses it exclusively.

Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024
Style: 1 PackSize: 1"×4ftVerified Purchase
Unlike Velcro you will have to buy 8 feet if you want 4 feet. It seems that all dual lock tape is that way. I ordered a couple and all came in the same way. I haven’t tested the grip of the back side yet. I will update when I do.
Update: The grip of the adhesive is good. Unfortunately the grip of the removable side isn’t quite as strong. I have standard Velcro that holds better. I wish I could remove another star.

This is not the first time I am buying this product. It is very useful and well made. It has a very strong hold. It isn't a hook and loop (velcro) which wears out every time one peels them apart. This is called a dual lock, and there are no loops to wear out. I've been shopping at TEMU almost everyday for months now and this is one of the very few items Amazon sells for less than TEMU. I was actually surprised.

I got this because the sticky side is supposed to be stickier. It's not. It's no sticker than Velcro you can get for a fraction of the price. Also, there's only the one strip (I guess it's supposed to stick to itself?), so you're getting half the Velcro you think you are. Way too expensive for what it is. What a ripoff.

3M dual lock is a unique product - superior in many ways to velcro. The hold is much stronger and more consistent and the glue is very strong. I ordered the 8 ft piece and it is a great value for how much you get for what you pay. The roll is nice and wide and I ended up cutting pieces in half length wise which made the 8ft go even further.

I'm not sure if the couple of rolls I bought were defective, but when I stick the adhesive side of this product onto my pedal board, or pedals for that matter, the glue strength does not hold. Even after days of letting the adhesive stick to either surface, the tacky side just does not stick rendering this product completely useless. Don't buy from this seller if you're looking for a working product for your pedals

Unlike Velcro you will have to buy 8 feet if you want 4 feet. It seems that all dual lock tape is that way. I ordered a couple and all came in the same way. I haven’t tested the grip of the back side yet. I will update when I do.
Update: The grip of the adhesive is good. Unfortunately the grip of the removable side isn’t quite as strong. I have standard Velcro that holds better. I wish I could remove another star.

I want to say off the bat I have bought from this company before and this is the first time I have ever run into a problem. I am guessing that they had a bad batch so you might want to take this into consideration when buying.

The way this works is both sides have a mushroom head that is pressed into a like matching piece for the other side. Normally you can press and release quite a few times before the tensile strength starts to break down and the holding power is lessened. That wasn't the case with this batch. when I pulled them apart the first time i noticed that allot of the mushroom heads had pulled off and were stuck in the other side. that tells me that something went wrong during the manufacturing process. With the price that you pay for this stuff you would think that the quality assurance would be better. like I said I have bought this exact product in the past and haven't had any problems, but either their QA has dropped or they are using a different supplier and it just isn't the same product as before.

Sometimes I need something that can reliably attach and detach. Old-school Velcro wears out after a while and doesn't bind that great. This all plastic Velcro binds really well, but ones that have cheaper adhesive might detach. Also this all plastic Velcro not likely to wear out anytime soon. The adhesive though is wear this item shines. I'd imagine other plastic velcros might actually detach from the adhesive side. Which would be really annoying. Wipe whatever you attach this to with rubbing alcohol makes sure it's free of any dirt, hair, or oils. So far, adhesive has never detached on me. It's pricey, but the reliability is worth it. I've bought this twice. No question will buy again if needed.

This was to attach a Blackvue Power Magic pro box to turn on/off parking mode for a dashcam on a '23 Ram dashboard. This little device weighs less than 2oz. One side of the Dual lock was on the little box itself. It seemed to stick to that ok. But when trying to stick the other side on the plastic dash side, it would not stick. It kept curling up. And yes, I did prep the surface with alcohol wipe. I tried again with another piece and warmed up the area with a heat gun. Once again it would not stick. When you pick it pick it up by the adhesive, it was not very tacky like vhb tape. Either this stuff is old or its fake 3M adhesive. Going to have to return it. Waisted about a foot with bad results.

5.0 out of 5 stars Versatile Tape for Mounting Power Banks to Portable Devices like the Steam Deck!
Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2023
Style: 1 PackSize: 1"×4ftVerified Purchase
This mounting tape is perfect for adding portable power bank solutions to handheld devices such as the Steam Deck and Nintendo 3DS!

All you have to do is cut two small portions roughly an inch and a half in length and stick them to the flat sides of your devices, one on the handheld and the other on the power bank.

I included images showing how I used this method. This tape is perfect if you want to have portable power and you still want to use your existing protective cases without adding too much bulk. The interlocking mechanism of the mounting tape ensures that the attached objects won't fall off so easily!

Make sure you get the positioning of the tape correct the first time. If you let the tape settle for too long, the adhesive becomes stronger and more difficult to remove!

Don't buy from this seller. I've Purchase these same exact hooks from retail stores, but I didn't have time to go to the store this go around. I ordered from Amazon. First and foremost, the hooks do not come in the command hooked packaging like they should. The seller sells them loose in a box. Secondly, the stickers for these are not the same quality as they are in the company packaged command hooks. They are loose in the small box, and they don't stick to things. When they do stick to things, they don't last long. I got these hooks to stick to the wall by my bed, so I can hang my super lightweight eye mask. This is essentially the weight of a small, thin piece of cotton. The hooks fall at the slightest touch, and that is because the wall stickers aren't the right ones for this.

Be cautious when being from this seller!! You'll save yourself a lot of time, effort, and money to just go to a retail store in your town and get some. I've already used several of these, only to have them fall down, so it's too late for me to return them. Don't be like me and get them on Amazon. Make the time to get the brand packaged ones from a store. I deeply regret my own laziness and trusting a seller on Amazon like this. I should have known better.

Oh these are awesome, of course. They come off the wall by pulling downward per instructions- no damage; and they hold surprisingly well.
There was excess humidity for a week this summer here and one wall became wet looking — the command strips just melted off. No harm done tho. So if you live in humidity and get drippy walls, then maybe not these. But otherwise, I’ve hung pics and towels - great for rental situations!
PS different versions hold different weights so check that against what you need before ordering.

I got these Command Small Clear Wire Toggle Hooks hoping they’d magically hold my stuff without leaving a mark or turning my walls into a disaster zone. Spoiler: they do exactly that. They’re clear, so you don’t notice them—which is great, because when stuff falls off, you’re left wondering if you imagined hanging anything at all.

The strips stick well enough, but the moment you get cocky and think “I’ll just hang something heavier,” boom—gravity wins, and your hook takes a graceful dive off the wall like it’s auditioning for a stunt show.

Still, they’re perfect if you want your walls to stay pristine and your stuff to test your reflexes. Just don’t hang your prized possessions on them unless you enjoy adrenaline rushes.

Works really good! I actually moved to a new place since buying them and had an easy time of removing them and placing them in a new place with new command strips. Haven’t tried anything heavy but bottle cleaning brushes and some stuff were holding great!
(Pro tip: while removing do it slow and try to pull the tip as close along the wall as possible to make sure the paint on the wall stays intact)

5.0 out of 5 stars The Easiest Way to Hang Without Damage
Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2025
Style: 10 HooksVerified Purchase
These Command Small Clear Wire Toggle Hooks are my go-to for lightweight hanging! They’re completely damage-free, which is perfect for renters or for areas where I don’t want to put holes in the wall. I’ve used them for string lights, holiday decorations, and even small picture frames. They hold surprisingly well as long as you follow the instructions (clean surface first and let them set). Removal is also super easy—no sticky residue left behind. Such a simple, affordable solution that makes decorating and organizing stress-free! They will be the perfect tool for this holiday season!!

Oh these are awesome, of course. They come off the wall by pulling downward per instructions- no damage; and they hold surprisingly well.
There was excess humidity for a week this summer here and one wall became wet looking — the command strips just melted off. No harm done tho. So if you live in humidity and get drippy walls, then maybe not these. But otherwise, I’ve hung pics and towels - great for rental situations!
PS different versions hold different weights so check that against what you need before ordering.

I wouldn't recommend these for hanging anything. For pictures, the hooks sticks out too far from the wall so your picture hangs crooked, touched wall at the bottom but is an inch away from the wall at the top. The stickers that adhere it to the wall are janky, i ruined one immediately trying to hang up the hook. I won't buy these again and i don't recommend anyone else do either. It got 2 stars because i was able to eventually adhere one to the wall and hang a picture. But it only looks 2 stars good and I probably won't try to hang anything else up. Also not sure how long until it falls off.

My fireplace doesn't have a great spot to hang hooks on to hold garland, but these command hooks have solved that problem for me! I am currently using 3 command hooks for 2 sets of garland, and it holds them with ease. Could hold heavier garland if wished. It is very sturdy, keeping the garland in one place without it falling between the hooks. I've had this up for several days now and it remains in place. So worth the money I paid!

This is the worst 3M product I have ever used. It did not stick even with no load. The strips fell off before I could hang anything on it. The packaging that it arrived in was missing some 3M branding that I am used to with 3M products, so I think the seller providing this strips may be distributing fraudulent 3M strips. It basically arrived in a bubble wrap envelope with the strips loosely thrown around in the envelope rather than the normal 3M Command Strips packaging.

I put a couple of these cord bundlers on my small appliances. When not in use the cords are conveniently out of the way. The tab is easy to remove and replace. I like knowing I can cleanly remove it and reuse it somewhere else. In my case, the bundlers are a little loose because the cords aren’t very long. It would be great if 3M made a smaller loop size and sell it separately or as a multi pack of different sizes. Regardless, I’m happy with the product and it was worth spending $12.99.

I’ve used these for three years now at the holidays and EVERY year they seriously damage my drywall, pulling a hunk of it off with 3/4 hooks. The sticky pull breaks off EVERY time and I have to finagle the actual hook off the drywall. Frustrating and costly and super inconvenient when I have to repair, patch and paint drywall every year. Additionally the length of the strap cannot accommodate my garland which is simply basic, not “influencer” garland.

I’m saving to use on surfaces other than drywall, if possible.

Bought this to hang a kitchen towel by the sink .
We remodeled our kitchen and I needed a place to hang a kitchen towel at the sink . This was perfect no drilling holes , it sticks perfectly to the area right beneath a kitchen sink ( you know the area that’s looks like a drawer but it’s not a drawer lol)
We were very pleased how well the adhesive sticks , it looks amazing that at times guests think that’s it’s an actual drawer due to the appearance and quality of the handle bar .
Def worth every penny !

The hand towel bar was fine, easy to install. It is a five star product. But the shipper leaves something to be desired. The box was broken and had been taped together. There were no instructions included. The bar was loose in the box. After looking through the box I finally found the mounting strips hidden behind a lower flap in the box. I've used Command before and found a useful youtube video to remind me how to do it.

Great concept but check your size allowance before purchasing. We purchased new kitchen cabinets and the thought of drilling into the new doors for the towel holders made me cringe. These look amazing but they did not work at all. The door wouldn’t close once it was installed. When I attempted to remove them it wouldn’t come off and ended up breaking. Very disappointing since I could’ve used it elsewhere.

## Strong Hold - My New Favorite for Decorating
**Rating:** 5.0 out of 5 stars
**Author:** Customer Review
**Date:** Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2025


Command Garland Holder comes with 6 holders and 12 adhesive strips. Each holder can hold 2 lbs which when used for garland covered in Christmas decor like I do with spacing these out up the stair banister it can hold quite a bit of weight. Have had no issues with falling off or coming off the wall entirely. I love the green color to blend with greenery to make it less noticeable.
I absolutely love these! I want to get more now I can place garland just about anywhere this holiday season my heart desires! Plus can actually leave up year round and decorate not just fall and Christmas! I used all 6 already but would like to try using for cord management on my next order! Can't wait! Highly recommend!

## The green color makes these so much better for the holidays
**Rating:** 5.0 out of 5 stars
**Author:** It's Just Me
**Date:** Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2025


I’ve used Command strips to hold up holiday decorations before, mainly colorful light cords. It was unfortunate that the light cords are green cords while the Command strips were white. Not anymore! These green strips will just blend right in. It seems reasonable to pay $2 extra for the green, over they grey, especially since Command strips are good value for the money anyway, IMHO. The size is appropriate for light strips or garlands.

In a test run, I found these strips to be easy to use. The adhesive’s stickiness is appropriate, as these held up just fine under the weight of the cords with lights. I weighed out 2 lbs. of coiled cable and these strips held that just fine, so the weight capacity they state is accurate.

I also have one of these doing cord management for my aquarium, since the background is green too. It works well there too.

## Great for garland, not for wreaths
**Rating:** 5.0 out of 5 stars
**Author:** Angelady
**Date:** Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2025


These are of the quality you would expect from Command. The size is great for hanging garland. If your wreath has a loop or string on the back, this would work for it, but I think this style is best for garland. It would not go all the way around a wreath. The color blends well with garlic and wreath colors. I don't understand why the green ones are more expensive than the grey ones, though. I think they are a little overpriced, especially since most garlands would require more than one set. I wish more came in the kit. I can see these being perfect for holding other things in place, like cords from my desk, too.

## Good for hanging garland / Great for managing cords

This review is for: Command Garland Holder, Fireplace Mantle Garland Holder for Displaying Garlands, Wreaths, and Holiday Decor Without Leaving Damage, Holes, or Residue, Holds 2lbs, Green, 6 Pack

I only need 2 of these to hang a garland over my door, when the time comes, and it seems like it will do a good job. Since I had left over hangers, I read some reviews and saw that some people were using these to manage their cords on appliances that did not have a good place to store the cords when not in use. I tried it on my shop vac and although it doesn't look pretty, it does stop me from tripping on the cord when I'm dragging my vaccuum from place to place. It has held well on the stainless steel surface and is easy to open and close by sliding the catch out of the slot.

These are exactly what they claim to be. They are simple, functional, and easy to use. The green blends in well with most holiday décor, and installation is as straightforward as you’d expect from Command products. It grips securely so far, though it’s still early to say how well it will hold up once the garland’s full weight and time come into play. For now, it’s a neat, damage-free option for decorating without nails or hooks.

Quite sure that 3M markets this same item as a cable holder and made these green ones specifically for holiday decorations - but either way, they work great! I use 3M hooks and holders throughout my house and these are no different. I put these on my mantle to hold some battery powered Halloween string lights.

They can also be put up on the side of a desk to hang excess cable thru or to run a cord somewhere. They are a great utility item to keep in the drawer. The included tapes stick great just like other 3M hooks and clips.

It's a few weeks early to hang the garland, but I used one of these to secure a power cord on the back of a kitchen appliance. IT WORKED FANTASTIC!

The 3m tape stuck solid and performs well with nice amount of sticky. The hanger is sturdy and nice and easy to use. Color perfect for Christmas and not too off for other things as well. This is Steph perfect way to organize those cables. These will be used not just at Christmas but all through the year. Great value. Versatile as it's thick enough for cables and flexible enough to other smaller things. Five stars.

I expected relatively cheap plastic hangers that essentially snapped together, but was pleasantly surprised. The plastic feels like quality rubber that's sturdy but bends easily while the ends attach by sliding one into the grooves of the other. It forms a very secure latch when positioned vertically and should work in most cases horizontally as well. They're also reusable; just buy some more Command adhesive strips -- they use the standard size.

## Haul Out the Holly

Finding a way to hang garland on my fireplace mantle has been a constant battle. I don’t want to put nail holes in it, yet finding a way to keep the garland from falling has forced me to use a few. I always tried to use little ones, not too many, and didn’t pound the nails very deep. It has been an uneasy situation every Christmas.

Then I found these Command Garland Holders, a product made specifically for hanging garland and greens on the fireplace mantle. No more nails.

I am familiar with this brand because I have used other command products in different places in my home. They have been strong enough to hold things, yet have been removable without causing damage.

These look like they will work the same way. I really like that they are green. That way they will blend in even more with my Christmas garland. Always make sure you follow their instructions, especially, make sure you clean the surface the way they suggest, wait the amount of time that is indicated, and follow the weight limit.

## What can't Command strips do???!
**Rating:** 5.0 out of 5 stars
**Author:** D.
**Date:** Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2025


I'll echo the other glowing reviews on these garland holders. I think I currently own or have at least used just about every kind of Command product ever produced EXCEPT for these, until now. I like and use their products so frequently that I have a bin in my hall closet dedicated solely to Command strips and hangers. That's some dedication!

When I came across these, I knew I need to also give these a shot. Up until recently, I was using small Command hooks to hold onto my holiday garlands on my mantle. You place the hooks so that the open side is facing the wall, away from the room, and then hook the garland into them and everything stays in place, since gravity wants to pull the hook forward, but the hook is there supporting everything... theoretically. But in the past, at least for Christmas, I have tended to layer my garlands, so having 3 strands trying to all be jammed together and held up by small hooks has presented some challenges that required zip ties and prayer to overcome. Taking that apart last year was an interesting exercise in patience.

These are a game changer! They really accommodate more than just a small hook, are sturdy, don't damage my mantle, and hold up enough weight that I'm not overly concerned that my garland, bells and lights will come crashing down this holiday season. As it stands, these are holding up my fall garland perfectly. You just adhere the base to your mantle, wrap this around the garland stem, and then fasten the end to the base. So easy. I do wish they came with more strips, so that you can get more uses out of one pack before having to spring for another pack of strips, but to be honest, the strips seem to lose their adhesion after sitting for a while (as I've discovered from some of my older strips in my closet Command bin!), so maybe it's best to buy them fresh every time you need them to ensure they're at max stickiness.

Love that they're useable year after year by just replacing the adhesive. I'm going to use these until they wear out (or until something better comes along, though I'm not sure this could be improved upon!).

## Versatile and Gentle Garland Holders That Blend Right In
**Rating:** 5.0 out of 5 stars
**Author:** Joseph Garcia
**Date:** Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2025


If you love Command strips in general, you’ll adore these. They’re long enough to easily handle thicker or custom garlands with lots of decorations. The material is a flexible, rubbery kind of plastic that’s easy to bend and adjust, so placing them exactly how you need is a breeze. As any other commend strip they are supper sticky, and can hang anywhere.

One of the best parts is that they come off cleanly without leaving any damage or residue on my mantel or walls. The green color blends perfectly with garlands or even other greenery, so they’re pretty discreet if you want to hang up wreaths or plants. Plus, you get six in a pack, which is great value for decorating multiple spots.

Overall, these holders are a fantastic and damage-free way to display holiday décor or other hanging items. Definitely recommend them!

## Check the weight and surface. Works well!
**Rating:** 4.0 out of 5 stars
**Author:** Courtney
**Date:** Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2025


These Command Garland Holders are such a smart and practical solution for decorating without any mess or damage. They make it so easy to hang garlands, wreaths, or other holiday decorations around the fireplace or doorways without worrying about nails, hooks, or sticky residue. The green color blends in nicely with greenery and other seasonal decor, so they don’t stand out or distract from the decorations themselves. They hold surprisingly well for their small size and are a total lifesaver for anyone who loves decorating but hates cleaning up afterward.

The installation is simple and quick. You just peel, stick, and press firmly, and the adhesive feels strong right away. I used them to hold a garland across the fireplace mantel, and they kept it securely in place through the entire season without slipping or loosening. They also come off easily when the holidays are over, leaving the surface completely clean. No marks, no paint peeling, and no residue at all, which is exactly what makes Command products so reliable and worth having on hand.

Each hook can hold up to two pounds, which is enough for most lightweight garlands or wreaths, though if your decor is heavier or especially full, you might need to use a few extra hooks for added support. I love that the pack includes six, which gives you flexibility for different decorating ideas. You can space them out across a mantel, window frame, or banister, and they stay hidden under the greenery for a neat and polished look.

The only small downside is that their holding power does depend on the surface. Smooth, clean surfaces work perfectly, but if your surface is textured or dusty, the adhesive may not stick as firmly. Once you find the right placement though, they perform wonderfully and can easily be reused with new strips next season.

Overall, these garland holders are one of those little things that make holiday decorating so much easier and stress-free. They save time, protect your home from damage, and help you achieve that classic holiday look without the hassle of nails or hooks. I absolutely recommend them for anyone who loves decorating for the holidays but wants everything to look clean and put together when the season is over.

We’re big fans of Command products and use them all the time around the house. These are a bit different since they’re made for holiday decorations per the color and would be amazing for hanging garlands. I actually got them to organize wires behind our TV and sound system, and they’ve been perfect for that. The flexible silicone-like holder grips cords easily, while the base is firm and sticks securely with the reliable Command adhesive. These feel very sturdy & are practical and easy to use. The only surprise is that it didn’t come in a traditional packaging but rather in a bubble wrap bag, less waste is good!

My fireplace doesn't have a great spot to hang hooks on to hold garland, but these command hooks have solved that problem for me! I am currently using 3 command hooks for 2 sets of garland, and it holds them with ease. Could hold heavier garland if wished. It is very sturdy, keeping the garland in one place without it falling between the hooks. I've had this up for several days now and it remains in place. So worth the money I paid!

This is the worst 3M product I have ever used. It did not stick even with no load. The strips fell off before I could hang anything on it.

We bought these to use for our stockings. Held the weight and worked great. Prevented our toddler from pulling them off and easy to hand and remove. Will be reusing these next year.

I use these cord bundlers for many different things. Great for keeping rubber gloves on the inside of kitchen sink cabinet, holding headphones on side of desk and holding oxygen tubing on wall when not in use. So many ways to use them. If placing on a rough surface it helps if you use a 2-way tape that peels off easily if command strip won't hold.

Purchased this item to hang garland around my front door. Unfortunately they did not stick very well to the siding so I ended up using nails. I think the product would work better inside because the cold weather was part of the problem.

After our heavy Christmas mantle garland fell off, I searched for ways to keep it in place. I found a YouTube video showing how to use these and it worked great. I used 5 across our long mantel. You do have to fluff to cover them. Not crazy about the gray color. Wish they were clear or even black. But this is the way to go and I didn't know they existed until I watched the video.

## Convenient cord keeper

I put a couple of these cord bundlers on my small appliances. When not in use the cords are conveniently out of the way. The tab is easy to remove and replace. I like knowing I can cleanly remove it and reuse it somewhere else. In my case, the bundlers are a little loose because the cords aren’t very long. It would be great if 3M made a smaller loop size and sell it separately or as a multi pack of different sizes. Regardless, I’m happy with the product and it was worth spending $12.99.

## Rips Off Drywall, Can’t Grip Garland Well
**Rating:** 1.0 out of 5 stars
**Author:** dhasselhoff

I’ve used these for three years now at the holidays and EVERY year they seriously damage my drywall, pulling a hunk of it off with 3/4 hooks. The sticky pull breaks off EVERY time and I have to finagle the actual hook off the drywall. Frustrating and costly and super inconvenient when I have to repair, patch and paint drywall every year. Additionally the length of the strap cannot accommodate my garland which is simply basic, not “influencer” garland.

I’m saving to use on surfaces other than drywall, if possible.

So I originally bought a cheaper version of something similar to this, and it did not work at all however, these were absolutely amazing. I used all six to hold a heavy garland on my mantle that had a heavy battery box and these held the garland throughout the whole holiday season. I absolutely love them and will definitely keep using them moving forward. I would highly recommend these to anyone looking to hang garland. This was a huge find and a game changer for me! They were super easy to put on and easy to remove. I was worried about removing them and tearing up my mantel but they came right off with no damage. I love how I got a pack of 6, and I can resume them.

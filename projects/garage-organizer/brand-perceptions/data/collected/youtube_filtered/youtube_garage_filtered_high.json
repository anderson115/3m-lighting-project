    "text": "The rolling tool chests have evolved and work very efficiently, for a few key reasons: 1) the drawers are a good size to visually scan, and depth fits a great majority of standard tools. Liners and some internal organizing is all one needs to learn what goes where without over-organizing and wasting space; 2) more small cabinets can fit on top, and drawers are at or below eye level, a real problem for built-in shelving and cabinets over work areas. 3) Most drawers fully extend, and are very strong even loaded with tools. 4) You can move them nearer, or away, from areas, and unlike tray systems, aren't likely to tip over. The metal construction is rigid, but thinner than any wood drawer systems, which are heavy and usually built semi-permanently, demanding a lot of pre-planning design.\n  If your shop is for miscellaneous repair and DIY work, not woodworking, building out a full storage and wall system is impractical and costly, without all the wood tools needed.",

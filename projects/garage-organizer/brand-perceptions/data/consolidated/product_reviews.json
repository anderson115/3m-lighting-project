    "review_text": "Used almost the entire box for a Halloween costume project, primarily to hold EVA foam pieces together. The sheer amount of product is the value here. For the most part it does the job. I did experience some inconsistent performance with more weight-bearing applications, both with the hook and loop as well as with the adhesive. I won't be pulling apart the attached pieces apart often, if at all, but I would have reasonable concerns about the long-term sticking power (hook and loop - and - adhesive) if I did. I've used other brands before that I trusted that are no longer available, and while I would buy this item again, my level of confidence isn't quite as high. But, for semi-permanent usage with minimal weight-bearing, it's solid.",

I've had several pieces of art just fall off the wall out of nowhere, and that's really frustrating. No breakage yet, but I'm not going to be waiting to see if that happens.

The size is appropriate for light strips or garlands.\nIn a test run, I found these strips to be easy to use. The adhesive\u2019s stickiness is appropriate, as these held up just fine under the weight of the cords with lights. I weighed out 2 lbs. of coiled cable and these strips held that just fine, so the weight capacity they state is accurate.\nI also have one of these doing cord management for my aquarium, since the background is green too.

    "review_text": "I'll echo the other glowing reviews on these garland holders. I think I currently own or have at least used just about every kind of Command product ever produced EXCEPT for these, until now. I like and use their products so frequently that I have a bin in my hall closet dedicated solely to Command strips and hangers. That's some dedication!\nWhen I came across these, I knew I need to also give these a shot. Up until recently, I was using small Command hooks to hold onto my holiday garlands on my mantle. You place the hooks so that the open side is facing the wall, away from the room, and then hook the garland into them and everything stays in place, since gravity wants to pull the hook forward, but the hook is there supporting everything... theoretically. But in the past, at least for Christmas, I have tended to layer my garlands, so having 3 strands trying to all be jammed together and held up by small hooks has presented some challenges that required zip ties and prayer to overcome. Taking that apart last year was an interesting exercise in patience.\nThese are a game changer! They really accommodate more than just a small hook, are sturdy, don't damage my mantle, and hold up enough weight that I'm not overly concerned that my garland, bells and lights will come crashing down this holiday season. As it stands, these are holding up my fall garland perfectly. You just adhere the base to your mantle, wrap this around the garland stem, and then fasten the end to the base. So easy. I do wish they came with more strips, so that you can get more uses out of one pack before having to spring for another pack of strips, but to be honest, the strips seem to lose their adhesion after sitting for a while (as I've discovered from some of my older strips in my closet Command bin!), so maybe it's best to buy them fresh every time you need them to ensure they're at max stickiness.\nLove that they're useable year after year by just replacing the adhesive. I'm going to use these until they wear out (or until something better comes along, though I'm not sure this could be improved upon!).",

Plus, you get six in a pack, which is great value for decorating multiple spots.\nOverall, these holders are a fantastic and damage-free way to display holiday d\u00e9cor or other hanging items. Definitely recommend them!",

    "review_text": "These Command Garland Holders are such a smart and practical solution for decorating without any mess or damage. They make it so easy to hang garlands, wreaths, or other holiday decorations around the fireplace or doorways without worrying about nails, hooks, or sticky residue. The green color blends in nicely with greenery and other seasonal decor, so they don\u2019t stand out or distract from the decorations themselves. They hold surprisingly well for their small size and are a total lifesaver for anyone who loves decorating but hates cleaning up afterward.\nThe installation is simple and quick. You just peel, stick, and press firmly, and the adhesive feels strong right away. I used them to hold a garland across the fireplace mantel, and they kept it securely in place through the entire season without slipping or loosening. They also come off easily when the holidays are over, leaving the surface completely clean. No marks, no paint peeling, and no residue at all, which is exactly what makes Command products so reliable and worth having on hand.\nEach hook can hold up to two pounds, which is enough for most lightweight garlands or wreaths, though if your decor is heavier or especially full, you might need to use a few extra hooks for added support. I love that the pack includes six, which gives you flexibility for different decorating ideas. You can space them out across a mantel, window frame, or banister, and they stay hidden under the greenery for a neat and polished look.\nThe only small downside is that their holding power does depend on the surface. Smooth, clean surfaces work perfectly, but if your surface is textured or dusty, the adhesive may not stick as firmly. Once you find the right placement though, they perform wonderfully and can easily be reused with new strips next season.\nOverall, these garland holders are one of those little things that make holiday decorating so much easier and stress-free. They save time, protect your home from damage, and help you achieve that classic holiday look without the hassle of nails or hooks. I absolutely recommend them for anyone who loves decorating for the holidays but wants everything to look clean and put together when the season is over.",

    "review_text": "I want to say off the bat I have bought from this company before and this is the first time I have ever run into a problem. I am guessing that they had a bad batch so you might want to take this into consideration when buying. The way this works is both sides have a mushroom head that is pressed into a like matching piece for the other side. Normally you can press and release quite a few times before the tensile strength starts to break down and the holding power is lessened. That wasn't the case with this batch. when I pulled them apart the first time i noticed that allot of the mushroom heads had pulled off and were stuck in the other side. that tells me that something went wrong during the manufacturing process. With the price that you pay for this stuff you would think that the quality assurance would be better. like I said I have bought this exact product in the past and haven't had any problems, but either their QA has dropped or they are using a different supplier and it just isn't the same product as before.",

One side of the Dual lock was on the little box itself. It seemed to stick to that ok. But when trying to stick the other side on the plastic dash side, it would not stick. It kept curling up. And yes, I did prep the surface with alcohol wipe. I tried again with another piece and warmed up the area with a heat gun. Once again it would not stick. When you pick it pick it up by the adhesive, it was not very tacky like vhb tape. Either this stuff is old or its fake 3M adhesive. Going to have to return it.

    "review_text": "This mounting tape is perfect for adding portable power bank solutions to handheld devices such as the Steam Deck and Nintendo 3DS! All you have to do is cut two small portions roughly an inch and a half in length and stick them to the flat sides of your devices, one on the handheld and the other on the power bank. I included images showing how I used this method. This tape is perfect if you want to have portable power and you still want to use your existing protective cases without adding too much bulk. The interlocking mechanism of the mounting tape ensures that the attached objects won't fall off so easily! Make sure you get the positioning of the tape correct the first time. If you let the tape settle for too long, the adhesive becomes stronger and more difficult to remove!",

First and foremost, the hooks do not come in the command hooked packaging like they should. The seller sells them loose in a box. Secondly, the stickers for these are not the same quality as they are in the company packaged command hooks. They are loose in the small box, and they don't stick to things. When they do stick to things, they don't last long. I got these hooks to stick to the wall by my bed, so I can hang my super lightweight eye mask. This is essentially the weight of a small, thin piece of cotton. The hooks fall at the slightest touch, and that is because the wall stickers aren't the right ones for this. Be cautious when being from this seller!! You'll save yourself a lot of time, effort, and money to just go to a retail store in your town and get some. I've already used several of these, only to have them fall down, so it's too late for me to return them. Don't be like me and get them on Amazon.

Additionally the length of the strap cannot accommodate my garland which is simply basic, not \u201cinfluencer\u201d garland. I\u2019m saving to use on surfaces other than drywall, if possible.",

I used all six to hold a heavy garland on my mantle that had a heavy battery box and these held the garland throughout the whole holiday season. I absolutely love them and will definitely keep using them moving forward. I would highly recommend these to anyone looking to hang garland. This was a huge find and a game changer for me! They were super easy to put on and easy to remove. I was worried about removing them and tearing up my mantel but they came right off with no damage. I love how I got a pack of 6, and I can resume them.",

The Command 17205-16ES Small Picture Hanging Strips are one such tool that consistently delivers.\n\nThese strips are straightforward to use\u2014just peel, stick, and press. They hold firmly, supporting frames up to 4 lbs, making them ideal for small to medium-sized pictures. The real advantage is their damage-free removal; they come off cleanly without leaving holes or sticky residue, preserving the integrity of your walls.\n\nI particularly value their versatility. Whether arranging a gallery wall or hanging seasonal decorations, these strips adapt to various surfaces and layouts. The white color blends seamlessly with most wall paints, maintaining a clean aesthetic.\n\nWhile they're not suited for heavier items, for everyday decorating needs, these strips are a dependable choice. They've become a staple in my toolkit, simplifying the process of personalizing spaces without the hassle of nails or drills.",

It is laughably light, but there is a little tension when all three points of the hammock are hooked. As soon as I put the empty hammock onto the hooks, the hooks went shooting off the walls (literally!). Fortunately, no paint was ripped off! I tried the whole process a second time with no luck. At least they were easy to remove (obviously). Now, I am using the hooks to hold my COVID-19 masks in the hallway. They seem to work well for very light items, so I'd recommend them for that.",

So I doubt it's the humidity, or that this bathroom has very much. But 2 out of 3 fell off within 48 hours of each other after being installed properly just a few months ago. And I only hang 1 towel or 1 bathrobe on them, and they are supposed to be heavy duty. Maybe don't use in the bathroom or near humidity, or get another product.

    "review_text": "As someone who\u2019s spent years curating a gallery wall of family photos, travel prints, and framed certificates, I\u2019ve come to rely heavily on damage-free hanging solutions. I\u2019ve used various adhesive strips and hooks over the years, including other Command products, with generally positive results. So when I saw the Command Picture Hanging Strips (Large, White, 17206-ES) claiming to hold up to 16 lbs, I thought I\u2019d found the perfect solution for my heavier frames. Unfortunately, this product turned out to be a costly mistake.\n\nPros:\nEasy to apply: The strips are simple to attach to both the wall and the frame. The click-and-lock mechanism is intuitive and satisfying.\n\nClean removal (in theory): When they don\u2019t fail prematurely, they do come off without leaving residue or damaging paint.\n\nCons:\nGrossly overstated weight capacity: I used these strips on a 12 lb wooden frame with a glass front\u2014well below the advertised 16 lb limit. Within 48 hours, the frame crashed to the floor, shattering the glass and damaging the corner of the frame. I followed the instructions meticulously: cleaned the wall, pressed firmly, waited the recommended hour before hanging. Still failed.\n\nInconsistent adhesion: I tried again with a different frame and a fresh set of strips. This time, the strips held for about a week before giving out. The adhesive seems to degrade quickly, especially in rooms with mild humidity (mine was a climate-controlled living room).\n\nExpensive for what you get: At this price point, I expected reliability. Instead, I\u2019m out the cost of the strips and the damage to two frames. For comparison, I\u2019ve had better luck with Gorilla mounting tape and traditional wall anchors, both of which cost less and actually do what they claim.\n\nNo warning about surface compatibility: While the packaging mentions \u201csmooth surfaces,\u201d it doesn\u2019t clarify that even painted drywall can be problematic. A more honest disclaimer would\u2019ve saved me the trouble.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nI used these strips for two weeks across three different frames, all under the weight limit and on smooth, painted drywall. Two fell, one barely held on. For a product marketed as a reliable alternative to nails and screws, this was a complete letdown. If you\u2019re hanging anything of value\u2014emotionally or financially\u2014look elsewhere. These strips might work for lightweight decor, but they\u2019re absolutely not suited for anything substantial.\n\nSave your walls, your frames, and your money. This product doesn\u2019t deliver on its promise.",

I tried the clear adhesive product you see in the photo (which has worked the best so far) but as you can see it has somehow twisted and will no doubt fail at some point. I'm concerned that my tile will be damaged when the rod crashes down (again), so I came up with this rig. It's unsightly, but I think it'll serve my purpose. I just want something that will break the fall, or hopefully keep it from falling to the floor.\nThe strips have been stuck on the tile for 2 weeks, and when I tug firmly downward on the string they don't budge. If they stay on the tile, I know they'll support the rod if it falls.\nThe two strips actually \"lock\" together, better than velcro. They kind of snap together. As long as they adhere to your surface, they'll definitely stick to each other. Time will tell on this project, to see if the strips continue to stick to the tile.",

The thicker foamlike nature of the tape ensures a great bonding even to things like brick and wood! Totally weatherproof, too. I used this to attach a new flag to my mailbox and it has been happily baking in the Texas sun day after day ever since...it'll probably outlast the flag, itself! haha\n\nI have noticed that this tape's bond increases a bit in the first few hours from the time of application, as it begins to chemically bond to the surfaces (in some cases). In other words, it's easier to remove/change if you do so soon after mounting. If you do need to ever remove it, it will take a thin razor blade, Isopropyl alcohol, some twisting/prying/peeling, and lots of patience. Use with caution; it will \"literally rip a chunk out of drywall,\" according to a friend who didn't heed my warnings. haha",

    "review_text": "This is a review of the Scotch-Mount Double Sided Mounting Tape Heavy Duty. It was disappointing.\n\nThe item information in Amazon claims that this product is 'heavy duty' and can be expected to hold up to 30 pounds. Now I realize there are caveats to that statement; saying it holds \"up to\" 30 pounds means it will not hold anything OVER 30 pounds, but it doesn't preclude the fact that it might not hold up anything 3 pounds either. That statement is advertising double-talk.\n\nThey recommend 2 inches of the tape for a 1 pound weight. I needed to attach an item (barely1 pound) to a wall, I used far more than 2 inches of the tape, and it stayed put for a week before it crashed to the ground. Not what I would expect from a Scotch item. Lucky for me, the item didn't vaporize when it hit the pavement, and I reattached it yesterday using screws, which are very unlikely to fall out.\n\nMy verdict: 3 stars.",

I used them to mount decorations both inside my home and on exterior surfaces, and everything stayed perfectly in place.\n\nThe adhesive is easy to apply, yet it\u2019s strong enough to hold heavier items without sagging or falling. I also appreciate that it works on a variety of surfaces\u2014metal, wood, and even textured walls. Plus, when I needed to remove a strip, it came off cleanly without damaging the surface, which is a huge bonus.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a reliable double-sided tape that can handle both indoor and outdoor projects, this product is a must-have. It definitely exceeded my expectations!",

    "review_text": "I used these Scotch Extreme Mounting Strips on both painted walls inside and the smooth siding outside my house to hang lightweight decorations, and they worked exactly as advertised.\n\nPros:\n\u2022 Super Strong Hold: Everything stayed securely in place\u2014even on a very windy day. Nothing slipped or fell.\n\u2022 No Residue or Paint Damage: When I removed the indoor decorations later, the strips came off cleanly\u2014no sticky mess or damage to the paint.\n\u2022 Efficient and Flexible: I was able to cut the strips into smaller pieces and use just a little for each item. You don\u2019t need a full strip for lightweight decor, which makes the pack go a long way.\n\u2022 Used Them for Everything: I was able to hang every single decoration in my house using just one pack. Indoors and outdoors, these strips handled it all.\n\u2022 No Tools, No Holes: A perfect solution if you want to avoid nails or screws.\n\nTips:\n\u2022 Surface Prep Matters: Clean the area before applying to get the best hold.\n\u2022 Use Enough (But Not Too Much): Even a small piece holds well, but for heavier items or outdoor use, a bit of extra support doesn\u2019t hurt.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nThese strips are super reliable, easy to work with, and surprisingly economical. They held strong, left no damage behind, and one pack was all I needed to decorate my entire home. I\u2019ll absolutely be buying these again for future projects!",

I have previously been using another Scotch type double-sided tape with reasonable success and wanted to try this to see if it would be a better bond given the description and what I needed it for.\n\nThese strips are not a value for the money. In order for them to be effective you need to be generous with the number of strips you use for the project. Should you try to skimp, your project will be a failure. I found that I had to use twice as much tape than the previous style of tape I was using. The product description is the exact opposite. The red colored side of the tape is almost impossible to pull off. I will not buy this again nor do I recommend.",

It looked great and appear to be securely adhered for 3 days. Then 1 by 1 the prints started falling off the walls. I tried to pry the remaining ones off the wall and it ripped off parts of the dry wall paper backing. So the tape works, until it doesn\u2019t and there\u2019s no way to tell when the adhesion will give out. One frame fell on my arm and shattered, but thankfully didn\u2019t cut me. This frame is one of the cheap Michaels frames that are just a lightweight plastic bevel and a sheet of glass and yet it couldn\u2019t hold it up.",

Some scotch products I have u couldn\u2019t get off a wall without ripping the hole wall down like I did when hung a guitar which different scotch product (the Velcro white tape) but that\u2019s still up.. but I bought the gorilla tape for outdoor and put 6 huge strips across it and it came crashing down within 2-4 hrs max- so I switched to scotch products and so far so good other then this odd thing with heavier item holding up and something weighs like maybe if holding say idk 2 normal size lighters or say a very light Xmas ornament that weighs nothing (but 4 things I put up that weigh nothing came crashing down- kinda doesn\u2019t make sense",

    "review_text": "It sticks wonderfully. I used it to stick my power and USB strips to the wall, as well as to stick my spouse's magnetic chargers to the bedside table. It does a great job at both tasks.\n\nRemoving it is just a matter of getting a fingernail or razor blade under a corner and pulling it off from the side. Please note that when I spot tested it, it came off of metal, plastic, and tile without an issue, but putting it on a painted wall DID cause some damage to the paint. I used it on our painted wall because we're not planning to move, and I have no issue repainting if we ever do. If you're living in an apartment or a temporary situation and want to put something on a painted wall, this may not be the right choice for you.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the packaging is terrible. It comes in a plastic bag, which it sticks to, rather than in a bag made of something like the red liner. Because it's sticky on the side, and because pulling from the side is how such tapes are removed, taking it out of the bag causes some (admittedly minor) damage to the mounting tape. This is just sloppy and shows a lack of attention to detail by the manufacturer.",

I've used it for hanging some command style hooks on my walls and they're holding up extremely well. None have fallen off so far!\nI'm not sure how easy they are to remove or if they leave any damage because I haven't tried to take any of the hooks down.

A much more practical and effective version of a command strip. So far I\u2019ve used these much as the pictures they have in the listing, for the tools in the garage and they seem to hold well. I am waiting to paint the kids room and will hang up all of their pictures after. There\u2019s one notorious one that I could never hang with a command strip so I\u2019m excited to try it. Will post photos once I get everything up!\n*edited to add* I recently purchased a breakfast nook from Wayfair and I ended up using strips of this tape in between many pieces to help it stay together better...since the construction of the pieces itself were very shoddy.",

Super strong hold that actually works (goodbye, fallen picture frames!), easy to apply, and leaves no messy residue when you need to move things around. Perfect for renters or anyone who doesn't want to put holes in walls. The 15lb strength means business - I've used it for everything from lightweight shelves to holiday decorations. Clean, simple, reliable. What more could you want from tape?",

First, I arranged the photos how I wanted them. Then I flipped them over and stuch a small square of tape in the center of the back of each photo. Next, I peeled the backing off of the other side of tape and stuck it where I wanted it. It was easy to reposition the photos as needed. It was strong enough to hold the photo. The photo display was for my son\u2018s graduation party. It was easy to reposition the photos, and they did not fall off. This is perfect for indoor use. I do not know how it would hold up in wind or rain. For windy conditions maybe you would do something on each of the four corners of the photos instead. Once the photos were mounted, I was able to easily hang the canvas from a nail on my wall.\nI don\u2019t think I would use this on antique or vintage photos that you want to preserve. All of my photos were printed at Walgreens from my phone.",

The blush was expensive and also extremely hard to switch out product for the refill, something I didn't realize at the time. The refill sat in the base of the case but a $50 disaster was on the horizon.\n\nThis worked perfectly, wasn't too thick for the thin case, and held well. Not super pleased with the makeup company that sells refills that won't actually refill correctly but very pleased with this mounting tape.",

It's reliable, easy to use, and has become an essential item in my home.\n\nBut be weary! While it\u2019s fantastic for little jobs, don\u2019t expect it to hold up larger items, especially if you're stubborn like me. I tried hanging a bigger piece\u2014out of impatience, not wanting to deal with the necessary wall anchors\u2014and within minutes, I heard a loud crash as it fell from the wall. So, little jobs? YES. Hanging a picture nearly half the size of your wall? NO.\n\nAs I write this, I\u2019m sadly down to about 4-5 inches of tape, holding on to it like a desperate hoarder, but trust me, for smaller tasks, this tape is a total lifesaver. Highly recommend it, but maybe not for your most ambitious hanging projects!",

For years I relied on 3M Command strips, which seemed great until the adhesive started degrading and my glass frames fell, ruining several expensive pieces.\n\nEnter the 3M CLAW Drywall Picture Hangers \u2014 an absolute game-changer! The spot marker feature makes hanging pictures foolproof: attach the marker to the frame, hold it level, press it to the wall, and mark the spot. Then just insert the claw and hang your picture. Every single time, my frames were hung perfectly level, with no extra holes, no frustration, and no do-overs.\n\nThe claws seat securely in drywall or studs, with no need for anchors, and they hold strong \u2014 so much more reliable than adhesive strips. Honestly, these have made picture hanging stress-free and even enjoyable. Highly recommend to anyone who\u2019s ever struggled like me!",

I hang all my heavy art (paintings/wood work) and mirrors with 3M claws or tape, and they never budge, even when I bump into them. The quality is insane, and the engineering is just *chef's kiss*. As an engineer, I love not having to drill and just being able to push them in. Okay, sometimes they're not the easiest to push, but a little tap with a hammer (saves you from sore thumbs) gets them going, and then you can hang stuff without worrying! I've used these for years and tell everyone about them when they move. Thanks, 3M!",

So far, they are holding tight and I didn't have to use studs or hang them in awkward places. They are sturdy and a good price. I took off one star because I can't just \"push\" them into the wall with fingers as instructed. I used a rubber mallet which can bend the hanger part toward the wall, defeating the purpose. I found a way to make it work, but I hope the Claw folks figure out how to use tools in the next evolution of this product.",

Thankfully we didn\u2019t nail hard but gently to make sure we didn\u2019t damage anything behind the wall.\n\nI was so disappointed, I literally did not a wall to hang my favorite clock on. I searched for a solution and found the claw. I didn\u2019t believe this would work but the reviews convinced me to try. IT WORKED! I made sure we bought the appropriate weight capacity and amazed at how well these work.\n\nIf you have a wall but not sure what\u2019s behind it these will work!

For years I relied on 3M Command strips, which seemed great until the adhesive started degrading and my glass frames fell, ruining several expensive pieces.\n\nEnter the 3M CLAW Drywall Picture Hangers \u2014 an absolute game-changer! The spot marker feature makes hanging pictures foolproof: attach the marker to the frame, hold it level, press it to the wall, and mark the spot. Then just insert the claw and hang your picture. Every single time, my frames were hung perfectly level, with no extra holes, no frustration, and no do-overs.\n\nThe claws seat securely in drywall or studs, with no need for anchors, and they hold strong \u2014 so much more reliable than adhesive strips. Honestly, these have made picture hanging stress-free and even enjoyable. Highly recommend to anyone who\u2019s ever struggled like me!",

Although the installation process was more involved than I thought, these have held steady. I used 2, 45lb. capacity on each mirror to make sure they were secure.\n\nI still feel the installation process was easy to make my final product look great. Would get again!",

As an engineer, I love not having to drill and just being able to push them in. Okay, sometimes they're not the easiest to push, but a little tap with a hammer (saves you from sore thumbs) gets them going, and then you can hang stuff without worrying!

So far, they are holding tight and I didn't have to use studs or hang them in awkward places. They are sturdy and a good price. I took off one star because I can't just \"push\" them into the wall with fingers as instructed. I used a rubber mallet which can bend the hanger part toward the wall, defeating the purpose. I found a way to make it work, but I hope the Claw folks figure out how to use tools in the next evolution of this product.",

All you do is line it up where you want your item hanged and put the claws into the wall...so easy. They have different weights to hang heavier things. They're the perfect size as they're not bulky or jut out of the wall, only the hooks to hang your item. They are very sturdy and hold items well. I will always use these now to hang things on the walls as they are so easy to use and a great value for the job that they do. I would definitely recommend these.",

Thankfully we didn\u2019t nail hard but gently to make sure we didn\u2019t damage anything behind the wall.\n\nI was so disappointed, I literally did not a wall to hang my favorite clock on. I searched for a solution and found the claw. I didn\u2019t believe this would work but the reviews convinced me to try. IT WORKED! I made sure we bought the appropriate weight capacity and amazed at how well these work.\n\nIf you have a wall but not sure what\u2019s behind it these will work! I love these genius products that make the impossible possible!",

    "review_text": "I bought these for ease of use, and because I was looking for something to hold heavier, larger picture frames in my gallery wall more efficiently, as I\u2019m lazy and wanted minimal damage to the walls. I tested these by using a 15lb claw on a medium sized picture frame with glass, above my nightstand. My 3 year old one-brain-celled cat, Nugget, has absolute BEEF with this photo for some reason (my working theory is that he finds the painting of the white cat in the photo either alluring or unsettling). Every. Single. Day. Without fail. Multiple times a day. He is able to stand up on his hind feet to hook his claws between the frame and the glass, and pull the frame OUT FROM THE WALL, at a 45 degree angle, meowing like he\u2019s possessed by a demon (but in the tiniest, cutest voice imaginable, his little voice sounds like an angel singing hallelujah???) which makes the contrast of his roaring at my photo very startling. He has NEVER managed to pull it down, these claws have been tested by Nugget\u2019s claws, and they HOLD UP. 10/10 will be buying these again for every picture I need to hang. Cat tax of my orange idiot below, and the photo he loves/hates.",

    "review_text": "I bought these hanging claws to hang up a cool art piece I picked up while thrifting. It isn\u2019t really heavy, but the backing is metal, so I weighed the wall art to see which claw to use. My art piece is a little over 5 lbs. For some reason I was hesitant to use the 15 lbs claws so I used two of the 25 claws instead. I liked the convenience of just pressing into the wall, but you have to push SO, SO hard to actually get it in the wall. I\u2019m in decent shape and I even had to stop and shake my wrists and really push with my whole body weight to get them in. All this to say, the convenience of push and hang is nice, but these are not for someone with muscle weakness or maybe even arthritis. I am a bit concerned how this will hold up long term. Once installed, the claw was flush with the wall, but after I hung my art I peaked behind the woven art and it seems to me that the claw is ever so slightly forward now and no longer completely flush. I understand that my art kinda juts out a smidge, but considering that it weights a little over 5 lbs and I used two 25 lb claws, I\u2019m just concerned this won\u2019t be a long term solution.",

    "review_text": "If you\u2019re renting - or even if you just don\u2019t want to throw nails in your walls at home - these are a necessity. I\u2019ve been a ride or die command strip supporter for decades now, but our current apartment hates them. As in, the paint absolutely sucks and is just so low quality that the command strips don\u2019t always last long. Plus, we have neighbors that literally shake the walls and have multiple instances of flooding through the ceiling, both of which aren\u2019t command-strip friendly.\n\nWe started using these and are basically switching to them for everything. The cleanup after removal is way more discrete than command strips, because with these youll have a couple of teeny tiny holes to fill in. With the command strips, if they don\u2019t come off cleanly, you have to either cover missing paint or a deep chunk of missing drywall.\n\nWe\u2019ve hung up stuffed animal baskets with these, lightweight signs, heavy signs and lights, a coffee mug rack, and I trust them for use up high on walls or over other fixtures and furniture. These books are also incredibly easy to install, if anything you\u2019ll just need something with some weight (hammer, can of soup, a shoe\u2026) to help drive the hook into the wall, but it\u2019s very quick and I think most anybody with some upper body ability would be able to handle it themselves. Removal is a little trickier, you\u2019ll need something to wedge under the hook to pop it out, but it takes seconds, and the hook is completely reusable.",

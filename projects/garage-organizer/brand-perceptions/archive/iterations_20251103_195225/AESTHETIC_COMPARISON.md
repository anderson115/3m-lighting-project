## 🚀 Next Steps

### If CURRENT wins:
1. Use `slide1_FINAL.html` as base
2. Build slides 2-3 with same system
3. Extract design specs → Figma handoff

### If BOLD wins:
1. Use `aesthetic_BOLD.html` as base
2. Apply to slides 2-3
3. Extract specs with bold characteristics

### If MINIMAL wins:
1. Use `aesthetic_MINIMAL.html` as base

## 📋 What's Portable to Figma/PowerPoint

### All 3 Styles Include:
✅ Typography scale (sizes, weights, spacing)
✅ Color palette (hex codes documented)
✅ Spacing system (margins, gaps, padding)
✅ Component specs (tables, charts, panels)
✅ Layout grid (80px margins, 2-column)
✅ Icon system (sizes, usage, positioning)

### Implementation Paths:
1. **Figma:** Designer recreates components as reusable library
2. **PowerPoint:** Build master slides with layouts
3. **Pitch/Beautiful.ai:** Custom brand kit upload

## ⚠️ Realistic Assessment

### HTML = Proof of Concept ✅
- Perfect for showing visual direction
- Gets design approval
- Documents specs

### HTML ≠ Production System ❌
- Not editable by non-technical team
- No drag-and-drop
- Doesn't scale to 20+ slides

### Recommended Path:
1. ✅ Pick aesthetic NOW (from these 3)
2. ✅ Build slides 2-3 in HTML (proof complete system)
3. ✅ Extract design specs document
4. 🎯 **Hand off to Figma designer** ($500-1000)
5. 🎯 Get reusable component library
6. 🚀 **Then it's a real design system**

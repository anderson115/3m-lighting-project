## User Workflow Match

### Our Requirements:
1. Recreate 12 HTML slide templates
2. Preserve exact gradients, shadows, Inter font sizes
3. Locked Charcoal (#2D3748) + Teal (#14B8A6) colors
4. Editable PowerPoint export
5. NO screenshots, NO Figma plugins

### Round 1 Recommendation:
**Visme** - Manual recreation allows pixel-perfect match

### Round 2 Recommendation:
**Visme STILL #1** - Reasons:

- Exact HTML recreation requires manual control
- Custom gradients (balance scale, performance bars) need precise replication
- Inter font sizes (10pt-36pt) must match exactly
- AI may interpret designs differently

**Alternative to Test:**
**Presentations.AI** - Build 1 slide proof-of-concept
- If AI-generated fidelity acceptable → Save 4-5 hours
- If fidelity insufficient → Proceed with Visme

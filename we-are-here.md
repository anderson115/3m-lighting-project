**Installation:** `pip3 install python-pptx`
**Documentation:** https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/

**Key Classes Used:**
```python
from pptx import Presentation
from pptx.util import Inches, Pt
from pptx.dml.color import RGBColor
from pptx.enum.text import PP_ALIGN, MSO_VERTICAL_ANCHOR
from pptx.enum.shapes import MSO_SHAPE
```

**Common Operations:**

1. **Create Presentation:**
```python
prs = Presentation()
prs.slide_width = Inches(16)  # Widescreen
prs.slide_height = Inches(9)
```

2. **Add Slide:**
```python
slide = prs.slides.add_slide(prs.slide_layouts[6])  # Blank layout
```

3. **Add Shape:**
```python
box = slide.shapes.add_shape(
    MSO_SHAPE.ROUNDED_RECTANGLE,
    Inches(1), Inches(2),  # x, y position
    Inches(5), Inches(3)   # width, height
)
box.fill.solid()
box.fill.fore_color.rgb = RGBColor(255, 107, 53)
box.line.color.rgb = RGBColor(0, 0, 0)
box.line.width = Pt(2)
```

4. **Add Text:**
```python
text_box = slide.shapes.add_textbox(
    Inches(1), Inches(2),
    Inches(10), Inches(1)
)
tf = text_box.text_frame
p = tf.paragraphs[0]
p.text = "Your text here"
p.font.name = "Arial Black"
p.font.size = Pt(24)
p.font.bold = True
p.font.color.rgb = RGBColor(28, 32, 39)
p.alignment = PP_ALIGN.CENTER
```

        MSO_SHAPE.RECTANGLE, 0, 0,
        prs.slide_width, Inches(1.1)
    )
    header_bar.fill.solid()
    header_bar.fill.fore_color.rgb = RGBColor(28, 32, 39)
    header_bar.line.fill.background()

    # Title text
    title_box = slide.shapes.add_textbox(
        Inches(0.8), Inches(0.25),
        Inches(13), Inches(0.6)
    )
    tf = title_box.text_frame
    p = tf.paragraphs[0]
    p.text = title
    p.font.name = "Arial Black"

## NEXT STEPS FOR YOU (Next LLM - After Restart)

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: What Just Happened (October 28, 5:35 PM Session)

**Problem Found:**
- Previous handoff doc said Google Drive was "configured" but it wasn't working
- workspace-mcp was in config but had no credentials file
- No MCP tools were available

**Solution Applied:**
1. ✅ Installed `@isaacphi/mcp-gdrive` globally via npm
2. ✅ Created credentials file at `/Users/anderson115/.config/google-drive-credentials.json`
3. ✅ Updated Claude Code config with correct gdrive MCP configuration
4. ✅ Located PowerPoint file at `/Users/anderson115/00-interlink/12-work/3m-lighting-project/Garage_Organizers_Category_Intelligence_FINAL.pptx`

**Current Status:**
- 🔄 User needs to restart Claude Code for changes to take effect
- 🔄 After restart, `mcp__gdrive__*` tools should be available
- 🔄 First use will trigger OAuth browser flow

### Immediate Actions After Restart

1. **Verify Google Drive Integration**
   - ✅ Check if `mcp__gdrive__*` tools are available in your toolset
   - ⚠️ If NOT available, check `/Users/anderson115/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-gdrive.log` for errors
   - 📝 On first use, browser will open for Google OAuth authorization

2. **Upload PowerPoint to Google Drive**
   ```
   Source: /Users/anderson115/00-interlink/12-work/3m-lighting-project/Garage_Organizers_Category_Intelligence_FINAL.pptx
   Destination: Google Drive folder (ask user for specific location)
   ```

3. **Create Folder Structure** (if needed)
   ```
   3M Category Intelligence/
   ├── Presentations/
   ├── Reports/
   └── Data/
   ```

### If Google Drive MCP STILL Doesn't Work

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Check MCP logs: `tail -50 ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-gdrive.log`
2. Verify config: `cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
3. Test MCP manually: `npx @isaacphi/mcp-gdrive --auth-config /Users/anderson115/.config/google-drive-credentials.json`
4. Check credentials: `cat ~/.config/google-drive-credentials.json`

**Fallback Option:**
- User can manually upload file to Google Drive via browser
- File location: `/Users/anderson115/00-interlink/12-work/3m-lighting-project/Garage_Organizers_Category_Intelligence_FINAL.pptx`

### Potential Iterations

**User may request:**
- Additional slides (competitive analysis detail, consumer segments, financial projections)
- Design modifications (different color scheme, layout changes)
- Export to PDF
- Create versions for different audiences (executive vs. technical)
- Add animations/transitions
- Update with new data

### If Creating New Slides

**Use these principles:**
1. Minimum 18pt body text
2. Follow Bold Editorial color palette (orange/teal/dark navy)
3. Add header bar to every slide with `add_header()` function
4. Include citation footer with source references
5. Use rounded rectangles with side accent bars for callouts
6. Large metric displays (48-96pt) with small descriptive text below
7. Maintain consistent spacing (generous white space)
8. Test text fit - NO OVERLAPPING

**Regenerate from source:**
```bash
python3 /tmp/create_polished_deck.py
```

This will recreate the exact same deck. Modify the script for changes.

### If Google Drive Upload Fails

**Fallback Option 1: Manual Upload**
- User can manually drag file from Desktop to Google Drive

**Fallback Option 2: rclone**
```bash
brew install rclone
rclone config  # Configure Google Drive
rclone copy ~/Desktop/Garage_Organizers_Category_Intelligence_FINAL.pptx gdrive:3M-Category-Intelligence/
```

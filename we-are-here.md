## NEXT STEPS FOR YOU

### Step 1: Prepare Genspark AI Input
```bash
cd /Users/anderson115/00-interlink/12-work/3m-lighting-project/modules/category-intelligence
```

**Upload to Genspark AI:**
1. Primary: `SLIDE_SPECIFICATION_FOR_GENSPARK.md`
2. Supporting: All 6 numbered MD files (00-05)
3. Data: `04_CATEGORY_DATA_ALL_PRODUCTS.xlsx`

### Step 2: Genspark AI Instructions

**Prompt for Genspark AI:**
```
Create a 35-slide Google Slides presentation based on the attached
SLIDE_SPECIFICATION_FOR_GENSPARK.md file. Use the 6 numbered markdown
files (00-05) as source material for content.

Follow these requirements:
1. Design: Charcoal (#2C3E50) + Teal (#16A085) color scheme
2. Typography: Montserrat headings, Open Sans body text
3. Layout: Generous white space, max 3 bullets per slide
4. Visuals: Create diagrams specified in each slide description
5. Photos: Use authentic imagery (not stock) where specified
6. Structure: 4 sections + appendix as outlined in specification

The presentation is for 3M's cross-functional innovation team and must
be professional, data-driven, and visually compelling.
```

### Step 3: Quality Check After Genspark Creation

**Review these elements:**
- ✅ All 35 slides created (25 main + 10 appendix)
- ✅ 5 Big Boulders each have visual framework
- ✅ Litmus test questions included for each boulder
- ✅ Caveat slide before brand mapping (Slide 21)
- ✅ Data appendix has audit trail verification steps
- ✅ All footnotes and confidence levels preserved
- ✅ Consumer quotes prominent and attributed
- ✅ Design adheres to Charcoal + Teal theme

### Step 4: Client Delivery Prep

**What to deliver to 3M:**
1. Google Slides presentation (from Genspark AI)
2. PDF export of presentation
3. All 6 numbered MD files as supporting documentation
4. Excel file: `04_CATEGORY_DATA_ALL_PRODUCTS.xlsx`
5. `README.md` as delivery cover letter

## PROJECT SUMMARY

### The Challenge
First project with 3M. Need comprehensive category intelligence that:
- Is highly visual and consumable by cross-functional teams
- Has complete audit trail (AI is not trusted)
- Provides strategy guidance without creating attack surfaces
- Enables strategic conversations without derailing into data debates

### The Solution
**5 Big Boulders Framework:**
1. Channel Bifurcation Is Structural
2. Installation Is The Universal Barrier
3. Quality Skepticism From Prior Failures
4. Category Is Platform, Not Product
5. Customer Segments Are Bifurcated

**Three White Space Opportunities:**
1. The Renter's Dilemma (31% of market)
2. Premium Performance Gap (45-50% of market)
3. Platform Ecosystem Play (73% expansion rate)

**Brand Mapping (Outsider's Perspective):**
- Command → Renter's Dilemma
- Scotch → Premium Performance Gap
- Claw → Platform Ecosystem (if real consideration)

### The Deliverable
- 35-slide Google Slides presentation
- 6 comprehensive MD files with complete documentation
- Complete audit trail for all claims
- Expert panel certified as "Top 1% category strategy document"

---

## KEY DECISIONS MADE

**Format Decision:**
- ❌ NOT PowerPoint created directly by Python
- ✅ MD files + slide specification → Genspark AI → Google Slides
- **Rationale:** Genspark AI creates better visual design than automated Python-PPTX

**Content Approach:**
- ❌ NOT prescriptive product recommendations
- ✅ Category intelligence with strategic framework
- **Rationale:** We don't know 3M's business well enough to prescribe; provide insights that enable strategic conversations

**Data Rigor:**
- ❌ NOT false precision ($518,000 monthly revenue)
- ✅ Round numbers with footnotes (~$500K, Confidence: MEDIUM)
- **Rationale:** Audit trail builds trust; overprecision creates attack surface

**Visual Approach:**
- ❌ NOT text-heavy markdown reports
- ✅ Visual frameworks with diagrams, photos, infographics
- **Rationale:** 3M innovation teams need memorable, repeatable frameworks

## HANDOFF TO NEXT SESSION

### If You Need to Resume This Project

**Start here:**
1. Read: `README.md` in category-intelligence folder
2. Review: `SLIDE_SPECIFICATION_FOR_GENSPARK.md` to understand deliverable
3. Check: All 6 numbered MD files (00-05) for content
4. Execute: Pass specification + MD files to Genspark AI

**If Genspark AI fails or needs iteration:**
- Specification file is comprehensive - can be modified as needed
- Each slide has detailed layout, content, visual descriptions
- Design guidelines are in the specification header
- Source material references are in each slide spec

**If client requests changes:**
- Modify relevant MD files (00-05) first
- Update SLIDE_SPECIFICATION_FOR_GENSPARK.md to reflect changes
- Re-run through Genspark AI
- All content is version controlled and traceable

## NEXT STEPS FOR YOU

### Step 1: Prepare Genspark AI Input
```bash
cd /Users/anderson115/00-interlink/12-work/3m-lighting-project/clients/3m/projects/lighting-2025/docs/modules/category-intelligence
```
Upload:
1. Primary: `documentation/SLIDE_SPECIFICATION_FOR_GENSPARK.md`
2. Supporting: `documentation/00_…` through `05_…`
3. Data: `data/04_CATEGORY_DATA_ALL_PRODUCTS.xlsx`

### Step 2: Prompt for Genspark AI
```
Create a 35-slide Google Slides presentation based on the attached
SLIDE_SPECIFICATION_FOR_GENSPARK.md file. Use the six numbered markdown
files (00-05) as source material.

Requirements:
1. Design: Charcoal (#2C3E50) + Teal (#16A085)
2. Typography: Montserrat headings, Open Sans body
3. Style: Clean, professional, generous white space
4. Include visuals indicated in the specification
5. Reference data citations inline where noted
```

### Format, Content, and Rigor Expectations
- ❌ Do **not** build PPTX manually → ✅ Let Genspark AI produce Google Slides.
- ❌ Avoid prescriptive product recommendations → ✅ Focus on category intelligence + strategy prompts.
- ❌ Avoid false precision → ✅ Use rounded figures with confidence tags.
- ❌ Avoid text-heavy slides → ✅ Use diagrams/photos as specified.

1. **Command Cable Clips**: Manage and hide LED wires for clean aesthetic
2. **Command Strips**: Damage-free and easy-to-use LED strip attachment for shelves
3. **Command Mounting Tape**: Easier, damage-free attachment of lights to shelves

### **Verbatims** (11 total, showing top 3):
1. "You don't get a constant stream of light..."
2. "You just get a long continuous light..."
3. "It'll be perfectly hidden, but still shine up in the direction..."

## üî¨ **TECHNICAL DETAILS**

### **Model Stack**
- **Llama 3.1 8B** (via Ollama): JTBD extraction
  - Temperature: 0.3 (low for consistency)
  - Format: JSON (structured output enforcement)
  - Max tokens: 4000 per chunk

### **Processing Pipeline**
1. Load transcript (Whisper output) + visual analyses (LLaVA output)
2. Merge into unified timeline (sorted by timestamp)
3. Chunk timeline (2-minute segments to fit context window)
4. Extract insights from each chunk (LLM with structured prompting)
5. Merge chunks and deduplicate
6. Validate and sort by timestamp

### **Prompt Engineering**
- **System Prompt**: 2,300 chars defining JTBD framework, product categories, output schema
- **User Prompt**: Timeline-formatted context with clear extraction instructions
- **JSON Schema**: Enforced structure with required fields, enums for categories
- **Retry Logic**: 2 retries with 5s delay on LLM failures

### **Performance**
- Processing time: ~2-3 min per video (acceptable for 11x improvement)
- Llama 3.1 8B: ~118 MB/s download, inference stable
- No crashes or hangs (robust error handling)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT NOTE**

**Test used TRANSCRIPT ONLY** - The old analysis format had 0 visual analyses in the JSON (format mismatch).

**Expected improvement with visual data integration:**
- Current: 12 pain points (from transcript alone)
- Expected: 19-25 pain points (with 18 LLaVA frame analyses added)
- **Next step**: Refactor perception pipeline to ensure visual analyses are properly stored

- **When:** Local models unavailable
- Still near-free ($0.0003/50 frames)

### For Speed-Critical Use Cases: **PRO TIER**
**Best For:**
- Live video analysis (need <5s response)
- Real-time applications
- High-throughput batch processing (1000s of frames)
- OCR specialists (charts, multilingual)

**Recommended Model:** Gemini 2.0 Flash (2.7s, free)

### For Research/Testing: **ADMIN TIER**
**Best For:**
- Comparative model analysis
- Benchmarking studies
- OpenAI ecosystem dependencies

**Note:** Poor cost-benefit for production (GPT-4o costs more, scores lower than free local models)

# Offbrain Insight Framework
## Consumer Insights Writing Framework Based on Behavioral Science Principles

> **Reference Document**: Use this framework when developing consumer insights for any category intelligence report.

## üéØ Core Philosophy

### The "WHY" Paradox
- Consumers fundamentally **cannot articulate WHY** they behave as they do
- **95% of decisions** are made subconsciously (intuitive, fast, emotional)
- **5% of decisions** use rational, deliberate thinking
- **Belief ‚â† Behavior** - what people say ‚â† what they do

### Path to Action
**Quick, good enough decisions that FEEL right with least effort possible**

---

## ‚úÖ Insight Development Principles

### 1. **Focus on BEHAVIOR Over Attitudes**

**DO:**
- Observe what consumers actually DO
- Track actual purchase/usage behavior
- Watch for compensating behaviors
- Study behavior in natural contexts

**DON'T:**
- Rely solely on stated intentions
- Accept hypothetical scenarios
- Assume attitudes predict behavior

---

### 2. **Use the 4 W's to Infer the WHY**

When you can't ask "Why?" directly, use:

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **WHO** were you with? | Understand social context |
| **WHAT** did you do? | Capture actual behavior |
| **WHEN** did this happen? | Identify timing/triggers |
| **WHERE** were you? | Understand environmental context |

**Example:**
- ‚ùå "Why do you buy this brand?"
- ‚úÖ "Tell me about the last time you purchased this. Who were you with? What were you shopping for? When did you decide?"

---

### 3. **Be SPECIFIC, Not General**

| DO Ask ‚úÖ | DON'T Ask ‚ùå |
|-----------|--------------|
| "What shows did you watch on TV yesterday?" | "How many hours of TV do you watch per week?" |
| "Tell me about the last time you..." | "What do you usually do?" |
| "What did you do yesterday?" | "What do you do on average?" |
| Concrete, recent behaviors | Hypothetical scenarios |

**Why:** Specific, recent memories are more accurate than generalized patterns.

---

### 4. **Context is EVERYTHING**

#### Behavior is Goal-Driven
- Only 1-2 goals are active at any time
- People cannot describe states they're not currently in ("empathy gap")
- Same person behaves differently in different contexts

#### Research Implications
- **Recreate actual context** (in-store, in-home, time pressure)
- **Simulate reality** when direct observation isn't possible
- **Consider environmental triggers** (music, crowding, time of day)
- **Don't give unlimited time** - real decisions are made in seconds

**Example:**
- Testing packaging in a 45-minute focus group ‚â† 3-second shelf decision
- Shopping alone for yourself ‚â† shopping with kids for the family
- Morning routine ‚â† evening routine

---

### 5. **Combine Explicit AND Implicit Understanding**

| **Explicit** | **Implicit** |
|--------------|--------------|
| What consumers consciously say | Subconscious associations |
| Stated preferences | Gut reactions |
| Deliberate choices | Automatic behaviors |
| Rational justifications | Emotional drivers |

**The Best Insights Reveal the Gap Between These Two**

## üìù Consumer Insight Template

### Structure
```
[TARGET AUDIENCE] + [CONTEXT/SITUATION] + [TENSION/NEED] + [UNDERLYING EMOTION/MOTIVATION]
```

### Components

1. **Observed Behavior**
   - What they actually do (not what they say)
   - Specific, concrete actions

2. **Context**
   - When, where, with whom
   - Environmental/situational factors
   - Active goals at the time

3. **Tension/Unmet Need**
   - The gap, frustration, or desire
   - Often discovered through observation, not direct questioning

4. **Underlying Motivation**
   - The real "why" (emotional, subconscious)
   - Human truth that drives behavior

5. **Implication**
   - What this means for the category/brand
   - Opportunity space

## üí° Examples of Strong Insights

### Example 1: Lighting Category
**Weak Insight:**
"Consumers want better lighting in their homes"

**Strong Insight:**
"When parents come home from work (WHEN) and walk into their dimly-lit living room (WHERE), they feel like their home isn't a welcoming sanctuary after a stressful day (EMOTION). They compensate by turning on every available lamp (BEHAVIOR), but the patchwork lighting still feels cold and disconnected (TENSION). They want their home to instantly signal 'you're safe now' the moment they walk in (MOTIVATION)."

### Example 2: Food Shopping
**Weak Insight:**
"Shoppers want convenient healthy options"

**Strong Insight:**
"When grocery shopping with young children (WHO + CONTEXT), parents are on autopilot and skip entire aisles (BEHAVIOR) because their mental list and life are already too full (TENSION). They can't wait to leave the store (EMOTION). Products that require new mental effort to evaluate don't get considered - they need solutions that fit into existing habits, not new routines to learn (MOTIVATION)."

## üîÑ Key Shifts in Approach

| **OLD Approach** | **NEW Approach** |
|------------------|------------------|
| Asking "Why?" directly | Using 4 W's + observation |
| Isolated testing | Always considering context |
| Measuring recall | Measuring fluent processing |
| Measuring liking | Measuring approach vs. avoid |
| Purchase intent | Action intent + subconscious engagement |
| General patterns | Specific recent behaviors |
| What they say | What they do |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### DON'T:
- ‚ùå Ask consumers to be psychologists ("Why do you think you did that?")
- ‚ùå Rely on hypotheticals ("If we added X feature, would you buy it?")
- ‚ùå Ignore context ("In general, how do you feel about...")
- ‚ùå Make unrealistic comparisons that consumers don't actually consider
- ‚ùå Give unlimited time to decide (creates artificial deliberation)
- ‚ùå Ignore the order of questions (priming effects are real)
- ‚ùå Focus only on explicit statements (miss subconscious drivers)

### DO:
- ‚úÖ Observe actual behavior in natural contexts
- ‚úÖ Ask about specific, recent occasions
- ‚úÖ Look for the gap between stated beliefs and actual behavior
- ‚úÖ Recreate realistic decision contexts
- ‚úÖ Use time pressure that matches real shopping
- ‚úÖ Consider what comes before (priming) and after (consequences)
- ‚úÖ Combine explicit questioning with behavioral observation

---

## üîç Research Methods to Uncover Insights

### Behavioral Observation
- In-store observation (Retail Safari)
- In-home ethnography
- Digital behavior tracking
- Purchase data analysis (Buyer Behavior)

### Implicit Measures
- Implicit Association Testing (IAT) - gut reactions
- Eye tracking - what captures attention
- Response time - processing fluency
- Actual choices under time pressure

### Contextual Methods
- Shop-alongs with real shoppers
- Mobile research in-the-moment
- Simulated environments that match reality
- Passive tracking of natural behavior

### Smart Questioning
- 4 W's approach
- Last time narratives
- Behavioral sequences
- Compensating behaviors

## üìä Integration with Reports

### ‚ö†Ô∏è ZERO FABRICATION REQUIREMENT

**CRITICAL:** All consumer insights must be rooted in **actual signal** from research data:

‚úÖ **Acceptable Sources:**
- Video transcripts (actual consumer quotes)
- Emotional analysis from consumer research
- Image analysis from consumer content
- Observed behaviors from ethnography/shop-alongs
- Purchase data and behavioral patterns
- Social media listening (real consumer posts)
- In-context research findings

‚ùå **NEVER ACCEPTABLE:**
- Made-up consumer quotes
- Placeholder insights ("consumers want quality")
- Generic assumptions without data support
- Hypothetical scenarios
- Fabricated emotions or motivations
- Invented behaviors or contexts

**Validation Rule:** Every insight must trace back to specific research signal. If you can't cite the source (transcript line, video timestamp, data point), don't include it.

### When Writing Category Intelligence Reports:

1. **Consumer Jobs-to-be-Done Section**
   - **Ground each job in observed behavior** (cite video/transcript)
   - Include context and circumstances **(from actual consumer signal)**
   - Reveal underlying emotional drivers **(from emotional analysis data)**
   - Show behavioral evidence with specific examples

2. **Market Analysis**
   - Look for gaps between what consumers say vs. do **(from research data)**
   - Identify behavioral patterns from purchase data **(cite source)**
   - Note contextual factors affecting behavior **(from observations)**

3. **Opportunity Identification**
   - Base on unmet needs revealed through behavioral observation **(cite signal)**
   - Consider what consumers do (not just what they say they want)
   - Factor in context and real decision-making environments **(from research)**

4. **Recommendations**
   - Design for how people actually behave **(based on observed patterns)**
   - Account for autopilot decision-making **(from behavioral data)**
   - Work with existing habits, don't require new ones
   - Make desired behavior the easy, intuitive choice

---

## üéì Key Takeaway

**Great insights reveal the truth between what people SAY and what they DO - uncovering the subconscious, contextual, and emotional drivers of actual behavior.**

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 1. Client Project Pricing

**Before**: Guessing at costs, inconsistent pricing
**After**: Data-driven quotes based on actual costs

```bash
# Create new project tracking file
cp projects/project_cost_template.yaml projects/acme-analysis.yaml

# Track time as you work
# ... log hours daily ...

# Calculate costs and get quote
python scripts/calculate_project_costs.py --project projects/acme-analysis.yaml
```

**Result**: Professional quote with 50% markup, typical $20k-$30k for medium projects

### 2. Profitability Analysis

**Before**: No visibility into which projects are profitable
**After**: Detailed cost breakdown per project

```bash
# Review completed project
python scripts/calculate_project_costs.py \
  --project projects/completed-project.yaml \
  --format json
```

**Result**: Know your effective hourly rate ($220-250/hr), gross margins (33%)

### 3. Business Planning

**Before**: Unclear what overhead costs to cover
**After**: Complete visibility into monthly fixed costs

**Monthly Business Costs**:
- Subscriptions: $989
- Hardware: $219
- Operational: $230
- **Total**: $1,438/month base costs

**Break-Even**: ~10 hours/month of billable work to cover overhead

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

### This Module is NOT Client-Facing

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Include in client deliverables
- ❌ Show cost breakdowns to clients
- ❌ Discuss hourly rates with clients
- ❌ Explain overhead allocation

**DO**:
- ✅ Use for internal pricing decisions
- ✅ Quote fixed prices to clients
- ✅ Focus on value and outcomes
- ✅ Keep cost data confidential

### Pricing Philosophy

**Quote This Way**:
> "The investment for comprehensive category intelligence is $27,500. This includes complete product analysis, consumer insights, competitive intelligence, and strategic recommendations delivered in a professional presentation."

**Not This Way**:
> ~~"My rate is $150/hour and I estimate 120 hours, plus overhead..."~~

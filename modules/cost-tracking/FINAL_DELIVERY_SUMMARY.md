SUBSCRIPTIONS (proportional):
  Only tools actually used
  $989 × (30 work days / 20) = $969

HARDWARE (time-based):
  $219 × (120 hours / 160) = $159

OPERATIONAL (per-hour):
  ($230 / 160) × 120 hours = $173

API COSTS (direct):
  Exact usage from dashboards = $7

TOTAL DIRECT COSTS: $18,283
MARKUP (50%): $9,142
────────────────────────────
QUOTED PRICE: $27,425

```

### Expected Result

For a typical medium project (80-120 hours):
- **Direct costs**: $13,000-$20,000
- **50% markup**: $6,500-$10,000
- **Quoted price**: $20,000-$30,000
- **Effective rate**: $220-$250/hour

**This is competitive and profitable!** ✅

## ⚠️ Critical Reminders

### This is NOT Client-Facing

**NEVER**:
- ❌ Include this module in client deliverables
- ❌ Show cost breakdowns to clients
- ❌ Discuss your overhead allocation
- ❌ Mention your hourly rates

**ALWAYS**:
- ✅ Quote fixed prices based on value
- ✅ Focus on outcomes and deliverables
- ✅ Keep cost data confidential
- ✅ Present professional estimates

### How to Quote

**Good**:
> "The investment for comprehensive category intelligence is $27,500. This includes complete product analysis across 1,500+ products, consumer insights from 40+ social videos, competitive intelligence, and strategic recommendations delivered in a professional presentation with full data export."

**Bad**:
> ~~"My rate is $150/hour and I estimate 120 hours, plus my subscriptions and overhead..."~~

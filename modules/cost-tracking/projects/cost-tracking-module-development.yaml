# User Input Time Breakdown:
# - Initial consultation to define requirements
# - Review and feedback on cost structure
# - Review design approach and methodologies
# - Testing the calculator with real data
# - Documentation review and feedback
# - Final approval
# - Post-delivery consultation on usage

  notes: |
    This project is R&D for developing the cost tracking system.

    Only billing USER INPUT TIME (11.5 hours total):
    - Initial consultation and requirements: 2h (discovery_research)
    - Review sessions and feedback: 3h (client_meetings)
    - System testing and validation: 1.5h (client_meetings)
    - Final review and approval: 1h (client_meetings)
    - Post-delivery consulting: 4h (client_meetings)
    - Project scoping/coordination: 2h (project_management)

    NOT billing AI implementation time (~6-8 hours):
    - System architecture and design
    - Code development (calculator script)
    - Configuration file creation
    - Documentation writing
    - Testing and debugging

    This is a capital investment in business infrastructure that will
    be amortized across all future client projects.

# ==============================================================================
# PRICING STRATEGY
# ==============================================================================
pricing:
  markup_percentage: 0  # R&D project - no markup, track actual costs only
  discount_percentage: 0

  notes: |
    This is an R&D / capital investment project, not a billable client project.

    Tracking costs to understand:
    - Investment in business infrastructure
    - ROI calculation (will save time on future projects)
    - Amortization across future client work

    Expected ROI:
    - System will be used on all future client projects (50+ over 3 years)
    - Will save 2-3 hours per project on cost calculation and pricing
    - More accurate pricing will improve profitability by 5-10%
    - Better visibility will enable data-driven rate increases

    Break-even estimate:
    - At 11.5 billable hours @ $150/hr = $1,725 investment
    - Will save ~2 hours per project @ $150/hr = $300/project
    - Break-even after 6 projects (~2-3 months)
    - Lifetime value: Significant (ongoing profitability improvement)

# ==============================================================================
# DELIVERABLES
# ==============================================================================
deliverables:
  - "Complete cost tracking system (module structure)"
  - "Cost configuration database (YAML)"
  - "Automated cost calculator (Python script)"
  - "Project tracking template"
  - "Real project example (3M Lighting)"
  - "Comprehensive documentation (5,500+ words)"

  R&D PROJECT SUMMARY:

  This project developed a comprehensive cost tracking and pricing system
  for the category intelligence business. The system is now a permanent
  business asset that will be used on all future client projects.

  DEVELOPMENT APPROACH:
  - User provided strategic requirements and cost structure
  - AI handled implementation (code, config, documentation)
  - User reviewed and approved deliverables
  - System tested with real project data (3M Lighting)
  - Post-delivery consultation included for onboarding

  COST TRACKING METHODOLOGY:
  - Only billing user's consulting time (11.5 hours)
  - AI implementation time is NOT billed (capital investment)
  - Treating this as infrastructure development, not consulting
  - ROI will be realized through ongoing use

  FUTURE APPLICATIONS:
  - All client projects: Category intelligence, brand perceptions, etc.
  - Internal projects: Track R&D investments like this one
  - Proposals: Use for accurate estimates
  - Business analytics: Understand profitability trends

  SUCCESS METRICS:
  - System produces accurate cost calculations ✅
  - Documentation is comprehensive and usable ✅
  - Template is reusable across projects ✅
  - Calculator handles all cost categories ✅
  - ROI projection is achievable ✅

  LESSONS LEARNED:
  - Clear separation between user time and AI time is important
  - R&D projects should track costs but not necessarily bill with markup
  - Infrastructure investments pay dividends across all future work
  - Good documentation multiplies the value of the system
  - Testing with real data validates the approach

  NEXT STEPS:
  - Use system on next 3 client projects
  - Refine based on real-world usage
  - Consider Excel/Sheets export for easier reporting
  - Potentially add dashboard for multi-project view
  - Review ROI after 6 months of use

# Cost Tracking Quick Reference Card

## üöÄ Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1. Start New Project
```bash
cp projects/project_cost_template.yaml projects/client-name-project.yaml
```

### 2. Track Time & Usage
Update your project YAML file as you work:
- Log hours daily
- Note which tools you used
- Track API usage from dashboards

### 3. Calculate Costs
```bash
python scripts/calculate_project_costs.py \
  --project projects/client-name-project.yaml

## üìä Cost Allocation Formulas

### Subscriptions
```
Allocated = Monthly Cost √ó (Project Days / 20)
```
Only charge for subscriptions actually used!

### Hardware
```
Allocated = Monthly Depreciation √ó (Project Hours / 160)
```

### Operational
```
Allocated = (Total Operational / 160) √ó Project Hours
Hourly Rate = $230 / 160 = $1.44/hr
```

### APIs
```
Direct attribution from actual usage
```

---

## üíµ Pricing Formula

```
Total Direct Costs = Labor + Subscriptions + Hardware + Operational + APIs

Markup Amount = Total Direct Costs √ó 50%

Quoted Price = Total Direct Costs + Markup
```

**Standard Markup: 50%**

| Category | Cost |
|----------|------|
| Labor | $16,975 |
| Subscriptions | $969 |

| Operational | $173 |
| APIs | $7 |
| **Subtotal** | **$18,283** |
| Markup (50%) | $9,142 |
| **QUOTED PRICE** | **$27,425** |

**Effective Rate**: $228/hour

## üìù Time Tracking Tips

1. **Log daily** - Don't wait until end of week
2. **Be honest** - Track all time, including mistakes
3. **Use categories** - Match YAML categories
4. **Note scope creep** - Track separately
5. **Include everything**:
   - Research time
   - Client emails
   - Meetings
   - Rework
   - Project planning

---

## üí° Profitability Tips

### Maximize Efficiency
- Reuse code/scripts from previous projects
- Build templates and frameworks
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Use faster/cheaper APIs when appropriate

### Control Costs
- Monitor API usage weekly
- Use local models when possible
- Batch API requests
- Cancel unused subscriptions

### Price Right
- Add 15-20% contingency to estimates
- Charge for value, not just time
- Consider project risk in markup
- Don't compete on price alone

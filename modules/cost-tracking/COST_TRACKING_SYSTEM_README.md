## üöÄ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. Start Your Next Project

```bash
# Copy the template
cp projects/project_cost_template.yaml projects/acme-widget-analysis.yaml

# Open in your editor
code projects/acme-widget-analysis.yaml
```

### 2. Track Your Time

As you work on the project, log hours in the YAML file:

```yaml
time_tracking:

## üéì How the System Works

### Cost Allocation Methodology

#### 1. Labor Costs (Direct)
- Tracked hours √ó task-specific rates
- Different rates for different work types
- Client meetings: $175/hr (premium)
- Analysis/research: $150/hr (core value)
- Data collection: $125/hr (operational)

#### 2. Subscription Allocation (Proportional)
- Only charge for subscriptions actually used
- Allocated based on project duration
- Formula: `Monthly Cost √ó (Project Days / 20)`
- Example: Claude Max for 30-day project = $200 √ó 1.5 = $300

#### 3. Hardware Depreciation (Time-based)
- Allocated based on hours worked
- Formula: `Monthly Depreciation √ó (Project Hours / 160)`
- Example: 120 project hours = $219 √ó 0.75 = $164.25

#### 4. Operational Overhead (Per-hour)
- Distributed across all billable hours
- Formula: `($230 / 160) √ó Project Hours`
- Hourly operational rate: $1.44/hour

#### 5. API Costs (Direct Attribution)
- Exactly what you used from provider dashboards
- No allocation needed - direct pass-through
- OpenAI Whisper: $0.006/minute
- GPT-4 Vision: $0.00765/image
- Claude Sonnet: $3/M input tokens, $15/M output tokens

### Pricing Formula

```
1. Calculate all direct costs
2. Add 50% markup (industry standard)
3. Round to nearest $500 for cleaner quote
```

**50% Markup Covers**:
- Marketing & sales time
- Proposal development
- Professional development
- Business insurance
- Accounting & legal
- Bad debt risk
- Bench time
- Profit margin

## üìà Project Size Guidelines

### Small Project (40-60 hours)
- **Duration**: 2-3 weeks
- **Example**: Single category analysis, basic research
- **Cost Range**: $8,000 - $13,000
- **Deliverable**: Report + basic presentation

### Medium Project (80-120 hours)
- **Duration**: 4-6 weeks
- **Example**: Comprehensive category intelligence
- **Cost Range**: $18,000 - $29,000
- **Deliverable**: Full analysis + presentation + data files

### Large Project (150-200 hours)
- **Duration**: 8-12 weeks
- **Example**: Multi-category analysis, ongoing research
- **Cost Range**: $33,000 - $50,000
- **Deliverable**: Comprehensive strategic report + ongoing insights

## üîç API Usage Tracking

### Where to Find Usage Data

| Provider | Dashboard URL | What to Track |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| **OpenAI** | platform.openai.com/usage | Whisper minutes, GPT-4V images |
| **Anthropic** | console.anthropic.com/settings/usage | Input/output tokens |
| **Apify** | console.apify.com/billing | Results scraped, compute units |
| **BrightData** | brightdata.com/cp/reports | Requests made, GB transferred |
| **Google Cloud** | console.cloud.google.com/apis | API requests (usually free tier) |

### When to Check

- **Weekly during project**: Monitor for unexpected spikes
- **End of project**: Get final totals for cost calculation
- **Monthly**: Review overall usage trends

---

## üí° Best Practices

### Time Tracking

‚úÖ **DO**:
- Log time every day
- Be honest about hours (including mistakes)
- Track all activities (meetings, emails, research)
- Use the predefined categories
- Note scope creep separately

‚ùå **DON'T**:
- Wait until end of project to reconstruct
- Inflate hours to justify price
- Forget non-coding work
- Combine unrelated activities

### API Cost Management

‚úÖ **DO**:
- Monitor usage weekly during projects
- Use batch processing when possible
- Consider local models for bulk processing
- Cache results to avoid re-processing
- Set budget alerts in provider dashboards

‚ùå **DON'T**:
- Ignore API costs until bill arrives
- Over-process (analyze more than needed)
- Forget to track in project YAML
- Use expensive APIs when cheap ones suffice

### Pricing

‚úÖ **DO**:
- Quote fixed prices based on scope
- Include 15-20% contingency in estimates
- Focus on value delivered, not hours
- Be transparent about process
- Round to clean numbers ($29,500 not $29,337)

‚ùå **DON'T**:
- Quote pure hourly rates
- Underprice to win business
- Hide costs in markup
- Compete solely on price
- Give discounts without reason

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Commands

```bash
# Start new project
cp projects/project_cost_template.yaml projects/CLIENT-PROJECT.yaml

# Calculate costs (console output)
python scripts/calculate_project_costs.py --project projects/CLIENT-PROJECT.yaml

# Export to JSON
python scripts/calculate_project_costs.py \
  --project projects/CLIENT-PROJECT.yaml \
  --format json \
  --output projects/CLIENT-PROJECT-costs.json

# Both formats
python scripts/calculate_project_costs.py \
  --project projects/CLIENT-PROJECT.yaml \
  --format both \
  --output projects/CLIENT-PROJECT-costs.json

# Custom config location
python scripts/calculate_project_costs.py \
  --project projects/CLIENT-PROJECT.yaml \
  --config config/cost_configuration_2026.yaml
```

---

## üîß Customization

### Update Subscription Costs

Edit `config/cost_configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
subscriptions:
  ai_tools:
    claude_max:
      cost: 250.00  # Update when price changes
```

### Adjust Your Rates

```yaml
labor:
  consultant_hourly_rate: 175.00  # Raise annually

  task_categories:
    client_meetings: 200.00  # Premium rate
    data_analysis: 175.00
    # ... etc
```

### Add New Hardware

```yaml
hardware:
  new_device:
    purchase_price: 2000.00
    purchase_date: "2026-01-15"
    depreciation_years: 3
    monthly_depreciation: 55.56
    notes: "New equipment"
```

### Add New API Service

```yaml
api_pricing:
  new_service:
    cost_per_unit: 0.05
    unit: "requests"
    notes: "New API description"
```

---

## üìä Using Cost Data

### For Tax Purposes

Export project costs to JSON for accounting:

```bash
python scripts/calculate_project_costs.py \
  --project projects/completed-project.yaml \
  --format json \
  --output tax-docs/2025/project-name.json
```

Keep for tax records:
- Project YAML files (time tracking)
- Cost calculation JSON (expenses)
- API usage receipts
- Subscription receipts

### For Business Analysis

Aggregate costs across projects:
- Which projects are most profitable?
- What's your effective hourly rate?
- Are you under/over-pricing?
- Which APIs cost the most?

### For Client Proposals

Use historical data for estimates:
```bash
# Run calculation on estimate YAML
python scripts/calculate_project_costs.py \
  --project projects/prospect-company-ESTIMATE.yaml
```

Use output to create proposal with confidence.

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "KeyError: 'hours'" Error
- Check that your project YAML has `time_tracking` section
- Ensure all task categories are present (even if 0.0 hours)

### "FileNotFoundError: config/cost_configuration.yaml"
- Run command from project root directory
- Or use `--config` flag to specify path

### Costs Seem Too High/Low
- Review `cost_configuration.yaml` prices
- Check that `tools_used` only lists what you actually used
- Verify API usage numbers from dashboards
- Review time tracking for accuracy

### API Costs Show $0
- Make sure API usage fields have values in project YAML
- Check that field names match calculator expectations
- Review `api_usage` section in your project file

        "text": "Let's learn how to hang things in the garage. Now, I already did these chairs. Make sure that you find a stud, but having the right hooks is huge. I'm gonna be hanging up this ladder. It's pretty heavy and I need something beefy, but it also comes with a bunch of others. Now, I already have my marks, so all I'm gonna do is just right here, right in front of ya. You can do it into studs, you can do it into drywall. It comes with drywall anchors. I'm putting something heavy in, so I am gonna use this. Let's do it right in real time versus just talking about it. I feel like other influencers on this app, they don't actually show, they just talk. Let's do the real demo, okay? And yep, that's the stud. And we got one, gotta make sure that it's nice and vertical, as in level, here we go. Nice and snug on top. Nice and snug on the bottom, and it's that simple. Now, let me show you how it looks with the ladder on, and it can hold a lot of weight, just so nice. Now, I don't have to have this just sit in an awkward spot. I can just put this right here and be done. Right there, there. Look at that, that's how simple it is. I'm gonna get a bunch of stuff hung up on the wall, but that is why having these hooks are so nice.",

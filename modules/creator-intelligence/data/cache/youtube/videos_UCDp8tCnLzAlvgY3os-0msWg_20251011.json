    "description": "When I renovated, I chose no main light throughout my house for aesthetic reasons. While it looks great, the lighting was insufficient, which seriously affected my vision when working or studying at home! After some research, I bought a full-spectrum eye care lamp, which solved this issue. When choosing an eye care lamp, keep these points in mind: 1. Choose full-spectrum lighting, 2. Look for an up-and-down light design, 3. Make sure the CRI (Color Rendering Index) is over 97. This ensures more even and comfortable lighting!\n\nIf you've faced similar issues or have other eye care lamp recommendations, feel free to share your experience in the comments! Also, let me know what other challenges you've encountered during your home renovation, and we can discuss them together. Taking care of our eyes is important! \u2728\n\n#HomeDesign #EyeCareLamp #RenovationTips #VisionHealth #LightingAdjustment",

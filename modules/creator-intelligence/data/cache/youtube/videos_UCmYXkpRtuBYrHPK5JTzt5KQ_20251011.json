    "description": "\u201cOur new LED lights are the best, and I couldn\u2019t believe how much they improved the museum,\u201d states Dan Gable, the museum\u2019s namesake and legendary gold medal Olympic wrestler, NCAA champion coach and Presidential Medal of Freedom Recipient. \u201cThe updated LED lighting highlights each display perfectly and offers an open, comfortable space visitors really want to spend time in and enjoy.\u201d \n\nDuring a $1.5 million dollar remodel funded by donations, the National Wrestling Hall of Fame Dan Gable Museum in Waterloo, Iowa installed $100K in new, LED lights from yellowblue LED, replacing all of the old, incandescent lighting in the building. \n\n\u201cAfter a seamless installation process, the new LED lights created an ambiance that really highlights the museum artifacts and provides a cooler, safer space for our employees and visitors,\u201d states Coach Jim Miller, the Dan Gable National Wrestling Hall of Fame Director. \u201cBest of all, we saved over 65% on our energy bills and eliminated the hassles and expense of bulb replacement and maintenance fees.\u201d\n\nThe museum now uses approximately 65% less energy to power the new LED lighting and emits 70% less heat with the upgrade, saving thousands each year on their utility bills.\n\n\u201cAs a huge fan of wrestling and all that Dan Gable has contributed to the world, especially our local area, it has been a huge honor to help the museum offer a better experience for visitors and reduce energy costs,\u201d states Craig Schwienebart, yellowblue Eco Tech President.\n\nCurrently, yellowblue LED serves the entire Midwest and more and plans to expand significantly in 2022.

LEDs can create a safer, brighter environment for customers, employees and more.\n\nWe're here today to show you some of our new exciting commercial LED products that we have coming your way. I'm standing here, holding in my hand a shoebox parking lot or street light replacement. \n\nThis would replace a shoebox like we might see up here on this post behind me. And what's really nice about these is, number one, as you can see, it's a lot sleeker and a lot nicer looking than the big old shoeboxes. \n\nShoeboxes in the past required a big metal headlight lamp inside. And then the reason they have the box over them is because they have a big reflector that reflects all the wasted light that would go up, back down. So, it's a very inefficient technology. And this is a very efficient technology to replace it with. It's going to look better, produce better light, save vast amounts of energy. And this is what your customers want. This is what your customers need. So, come on everybody. Let's come to the light.\n\nFor more information, visit https://www.yellowblueled.com.",

    "description": "In many commercial, industrial, and retail environments, we will find what's known as PL lamps. And PL lamps are found in recessed fixtures, or otherwise known as can fixtures, like we see above us. In this particular case, we have horizontal PL lamps, which means they're going to go in and plug in horizontally and shine the light downward directionally. \n\nWe do have a few varieties of PL lamps. Occasionally, we'll find a vertical PL lamp, which will plug in vertically and shine the light, again, directionally down. So, there are two options in PL lamps. Make sure you look for these in commercial, industrial, and retail environments.\n\nAs part of Eco Technologies International since 2011, Yellowblue LED is a leader in the commercial lighting industry, helping thousands of small to medium-sized businesses find the perfect LED lighting to increase productivity and greatly reduce utility costs.

    "description": "In this short video, Eric Mortensen explains the use of a mini LED Wall Pack.\n\nOkay, we're still here on the same property. And as you can see above us, we had some shoeboxes that were located above the sidewalk adjacent to the parking lot here. We did have a couple of options for LED retrofits for these shoeboxes. And in this case, we opted to go with the standard LED wall pack for a very particular reason. \n\nThe shoebox above us is only illuminating the sidewalk below us. And it's not really helping the parking lot see any light. So, as people exit the building in the evenings in low-light areas or low-light times of the year, they're out there in the parking lot. They may be fumbling with their keys, trying to get into their cars. So, we're going to install a standard wall pack that is not only going to send light down to the sidewalk but also out to the parking lot, improving the overall aesthetics of this building.\n\nAs part of Eco Technologies International since 2011, Yellowblue LED is a leader in the commercial lighting industry, helping thousands of small to medium-sized businesses find the perfect LED lighting to increase productivity and greatly reduce utility costs.

    "description": "Discover the benefits of replacing your fluorescent lights with LEDs in this short video. \n\nHi there. This is Troy Downey. I am an agent for Yellowblue LED. We're here at Coon Rapids Real Estate and Insurance. We've got an LED job that we're doing a conversion on over here. We're about half done. We'd like to show you the difference between the fluorescents and the LED. Why don't we go on inside and see the difference?\n\nOkay, if we walk over here, we can see that this is the LED side. As you can tell, the walls look really clean here. The floors look a lot cleaner on this side. \n\nIf we go over to the fluorescent side, you can tell that the true color of the walls is not visible because of the yellowness of the fluorescents. The fluorescents actually lose 30% of their light capacity within the first six months. And these lights have been in here for quite a long time. So, the brightness and the color has gone away from the fluorescent lights, which makes everything look yellow and dirty as you can see. \n\nThis John Heydon. He's actually my insurance agent. \nHi John.\nHi. I would just like to ask John a few questions about whether he likes the light or not. So, John, what do you think of the light?\n\nYeah, it's a lot better. Lighting-wise, it's easy to read. It really cleans it up in here I think. It's not so dark and dim as it used to be. But, it's just a cleaner light, easier to read. We do a lot of paperwork. We're looking at that. It's a little easier on the eyes I think with it. I noticed that.\n\nPerfect.\n\nYeah, it's been a good change.\n\nWell, I would say we're really happy with the lights - just the difference. It has been fun seeing the difference in what our old lights look like versus what the new lights look like, how orange or yellow the older lights look, and how dirty or dingy everything looks and how clean and bright everything looks with the new lights. So, we're excited to get the rest of them finished. And I'm excited to see what it does to our bills.\n\nGreen is awesome. \nLight it up. \n\nAs part of Eco Technologies International since 2011, Yellowblue LED is a leader in the commercial lighting industry, helping thousands of small to medium-sized businesses find the perfect LED lighting to increase productivity and greatly reduce utility costs.

    "description": "Hi. My name is Kel Durham with Yellowblue LED. Right now, I'm going to show you guys how to change out the fixtures. The first thing you want to do is you want to take out all your bulbs. Once you have all your bulbs taken out, you'll want to disconnect the power from the ballast and cap it immediately. The black is going to be your power. So, you cut the black, separate it from all the other wires, and get it to your desired length. I'm just going to cut that there.\n\nAfter that, you're going to do the same thing with the white wire - the negative. After that, you pretty much just get the entire fixture down from all existing wires. So, right there, we just bypassed the ballast. So, all your power is connected to this red and this white right here. So, what you're going to want to do is take out these old tombstones, replace them with new tombstones, and then piggy back each one to each other. And then one of the tombstones, you're going to have wires running out of. Your red is going to go to your red. And your blue is going to go to your white to provide the power since we bypassed the ballast. This is the step that takes the longest here. So, bear with me.\n\nSo, you're going to cut those to size?\n\nYes. You'll want to keep one color to one side, so my blues are on your guys\u2019 left. So, I'll put this blue on the left again, piggy back it to this one here. I'll do the same thing with my reds except for the right-hand side.\n\nAnd you can choose either this one or this one. I'll just do this one for convenience out of this little notch right here. It's all ready to be hooked up.\n\nSo, here's what your tombstones are going to look like after they're rewired. I've got my blues on the right hand of each tombstone. So, I've got the blue running to the blue here, this blue here running to this blue. I've got this blue piggy backed out to the power supply - the neutral. This is going to be my positive except these are all on the left. It's all ready to be installed now.\n\nSo, when I plug those bulbs in, it's immediate light?\n\nYou're going to put this end right here, labeled with the \"L\", on the end. This has got all our power. These are our single-ended tubes. I loaded all of my power to this right end here. So, make sure you're hooking up the right end to the right power. \n\n\nAs part of Eco Technologies International since 2011, Yellowblue LED is a leader in the commercial lighting industry, helping thousands of small to medium-sized businesses find the perfect LED lighting to increase productivity and greatly reduce utility costs.

They're the ones that we chose to do our lighting, and we're very, very impressed with the change. After we put the new lighting in, it seems like the employees take a little bit more pride in their area. It's kept more orderly. It's neater. It's cleaner. We made the switch to Yellowblue LED.\n\nAs part of Eco Technologies International since 2011, Yellowblue LED is a leader in the commercial lighting industry, helping thousands of small to medium-sized businesses find the perfect LED lighting to increase productivity and greatly reduce utility costs. Yellowblue LED currently has regional offices in metro Milwaukee, WI, Des Moines, IA and Dallas, TX, serving the entire Midwest and more through a network of Independent Agents and Representatives.

    "description": "Welcome to Amy's School of Dance. I am Amy Murphy, the owner of Amy's School of Dance here in Huxley, Iowa. We have been in Huxley for 20 years. This is our 20th year. And we have ballet, tap, jazz, tumbling. And we also have a theater program. We have a competition group. We have an elite group. We have a company group. We have dancing for two-year-old's up to any age, really. \n\nAs you can see, we do have lots of lights in our studio. And one of the lighting specialists came to me and was wanting to talk to me about helping us save money on our lighting. And each room has so much lighting. And I'm always about saving money, saving the earth. And actually, I used to have little signs around my light switches - \"Let's be green and turn our lights off,\" and have to go around turning lights off around the kids. \n\nI didn't even think twice about it. Because once she showed me the rebate and the understanding of how I could save money, I was like, \"Of course. Why wouldn't I?\"\n\nI have a dream to open up my own performing arts school. And that money that I'm going to save will really help towards building that school. I made the switch to Yellowblue LED, and you should too. \n\nAs part of Eco Technologies International since 2011, Yellowblue LED is a leader in the commercial lighting industry, helping thousands of small to medium-sized businesses find the perfect LED lighting to increase productivity and greatly reduce utility costs.

    "description": "We're going to show you now how to identify a fluorescent tube and how to open up a fixture. Every fixture is a little bit different. But on one side or the other, on the long end of the fixture, will be couple of tabs. Pull the tabs and carefully lower so as not to cause it to fall out.\n\nThen, the next thing we're going to do is we're just going to spin our fluorescent tubes and pull down. You may have to angle it a little bit to get it out. Now, what we're looking for on each tube, this is how we're going to identify our products. On every single lighting product in the world, you'll see a stamp. It will tell you the type of product that it is along with the wattage that it's running. \n\nSo, to do accurate walk throughs, this is exactly what we need to find on the products in the field. \n\nOkay?\n\nAnd here we have our OptiFIT tube, which will run with or without a ballast. Just for the sake of showing you how much better the quality of LED lighting is, we'll throw it in, in place of the fluorescent tube that was out.\n\nNow the beauty of an OptiFIT tube is if this ballast were ever to go bad, we could simply pop this cover, exposing the ballast, and clip the ballast and wire that right to the power source, making this essentially a decent fixture.\n\nAs part of Eco Technologies International since 2011, Yellowblue LED is a leader in the commercial lighting industry, helping thousands of small to medium-sized businesses find the perfect LED lighting to increase productivity and greatly reduce utility costs.

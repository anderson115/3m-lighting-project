I repurposed 3 of those metal frame white reindeer everyone seems to have in their own yards with LED strip lights, made my own candy canes from pre-cut pipe at home depot and some red duct tape. Made some Christmas trees using upside down tomato cages with one repurposed old metal frame Christmas tree and radio station sign from an old piece of plexiglass wrapped in LEDs.

    "description": "Here is a whole house demonstration of the A18804 Audio to LED Converter board and the P4804 Daisy Chain board. This entire system of LEDs is using less power than a single 40 watt light bulb. These boards allow anyone the ability to create simple animations tied into any audio source without spending hours programming. These boards are now available on Amazon, Digikey and our own website www.animatedledlighting.com",

    "description": "This is the Halloween test script I've been using to test out the new A18804 Audio converter board and the P4804 Daisy Chain boards. This entire system as shown only uses about 15-35 Watts of total power. Using standard RGBW LED light strips mounted on the peaks and gutters in conjunction with 519 individually addressable LEDs around the garage door. It can run 2000 individually addressable LEDs in total. The audio input to the A18804 board is connected to the projector using a standard 3.5mm headphone jack. This will also be used for the Christmas show with many more lights. It's all controlled by one Arduino Nano Every microcontroller plugged right into the A18804. You can use our program for free, and we can even tell you where and how to tweak the program for your own application. The good thing about this system is it's small, inexpensive and allows the user to tweak the program to their own satisfaction, even if you've never programmed before.",

    "description": "The A18804 Audio to LED converter board is designed for the Arduino Nano Every microcontroller. It converts audio signals through a 3.5mm headphone jack to Pulse Width Modulation signals for running standard RGBW LED strips. This board can run up to 50ft without the need for power injection. It can simultaneously run up to 2000 individually addressable LEDs.",

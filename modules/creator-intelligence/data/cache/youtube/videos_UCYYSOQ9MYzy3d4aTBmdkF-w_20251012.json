This custom lighting solution eliminates limited visibility for skiers and snowboarders during nighttime hours. \u26f7\ufe0f\n\n\u26a1 Custom lighting design & layout plan: \nEach project has its unique requirements. Leveraging the existing poles from the new rope tow lift installation, our team designed a lighting solution that strategically placed the poles and fixtures in a triangle shape along the rope tow lift area. Why? Our main focus was distributing high-quality light in the skiable area. \n\n\ud83d\udcaa Consultative service from a Product Expert: \nTenney Mountain Terrain Parks requested to use an existing tree at the start of the rope tow lift as a light fixture mounting location. Our Product Specialist, Mike Redmond, incorporated this request into his product and fixture layout recommendation while providing hands-on support throughout the process. \n\n\ud83d\udca1 Fixture recommendation: 600W LED stadium fixtures with 90,000 lumens each for precise illumination.\n\nThe result? \n\n\ud83d\udc40 Maximum visibility for late-night skier and snowboarder students in the Plymouth State University area, improving overall after-dark experiences.\n\nTenney Mountain Terrain Parks even shared this video on Instagram, celebrating the moment they flipped the switch! \ud83c\udf89\n-\nRepost from @tenney_parks\n- \nThank you to all who showed support for the PLN Park dedication.

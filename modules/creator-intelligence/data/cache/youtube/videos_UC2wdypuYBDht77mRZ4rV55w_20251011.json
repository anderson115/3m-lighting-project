    "title": "How to Recreate JEREMY SOMA\u2019s Studio Lighting \u2013 Bare Bulb, Clip Lights & Contrast Control",
    "description": "In this video, we break down the lighting style of Jeremy Soma, known for his bold portraits and carefully constructed use of contrast. His lighting often feels raw,  grainy deliberate, and pared-back with a strong use of dramatic clip lighting. Pockets of shadow play against areas of desaturation and block colour. \n\nAcross a series of his shoots, I look at several approaches, including:\n\n\u2022 Bare bulb lighting used to carve sharp shadows and add intensity to the frame\n\u2022 Clip lights positioned for precise highlights and sculptural accents\n\u2022 Softlight umbrellas used to wrap light subtly around the face\n\u2022 Specular highlights from Deep silver Umbrellas and Octas\n\u2022 Mixing Strobe/Studio with Constant LED lighting\n\n\nSoma\u2019s portraits often rely on intentional pockets rather than filling everything evenly, he lets areas fall off into darkness, then introduces simple light sources to shape form and direct attention. A lighting style that feels restrained but confident.\n\nOverall I feel there is a solid base to work from here, but I also gotta put my hand up and say I didn't nail this one a 100% so its a learning and testing tool, not a THIS IS HOW :)\n\nI begin the tutorial with a lighting diagram, and draw in some basic areas to look at helping you visualise the spatial layout and understand how each light interacts. You\u2019ll also see several variations for each setup, giving you practical options to recreate the look in your own studio.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to create stripped-back portraits with strong presence, this is a great reference.\n\nSupport the channel and enhance your lighting workflow \u2014 get 15% off Set-a-Light 3D with our exclusive code:\nEASYSTUDIOLIGHTING at\nwww.studio-lighting.com/recommends/setalight3d\n\nThis is an affiliate link, which means I earn a commission at no extra cost to you.

    "description": "If you're starting to shoot fashion content or want to build skills that actually get you booked this breakdown is for you.\n\nI\u2019ve recreated a lighting style based on a recent Bershka campaign to show how you can light six different looks in one efficient studio setup. It\u2019s not about copying but it's about learning how to think like a campaign shooter and make creative decisions fast.\n\nYou\u2019ll see how I structured the session to:\n\nKeep the lighting adaptable but consistent across looks\nHandle both skin and fabric tones cleanly under studio conditions\nMake the most of one set while still giving variety\nMix editorial style with real eCom requirements\nAllow easy set-ups so Video teams can also work easily\n\nIf you want to get work in this space, knowing how to light efficiently is a must.\nBrands and clients need people who can deliver strong results without wasting time or overcomplicating the shoot. It\u2019s one of those underrated skills that keeps clients coming back and helps you build a sustainable practice.\n\nWhether you're working on your first eCom job or already shooting campaigns, this has loads you can take straight into your next session.\n\nAll references to Bershka are for educational use only. This is not an ad or collab I\u2019m using the campaign as a visual case study for studio lighting and content creation. This is also not advocating fast fashion. \n\nSupport the channel and enhance your lighting workflow\u2014get 15% off Set-a-Light 3D with our exclusive code: EASYSTUDIOLIGHTING at\n\ud83d\udc49 www.studio-lighting.com/recommends/setalight3d\n\nThis is an affiliate link, which means I earn a commission at no extra cost to you.

    "description": "If you're figuring out your visual identity as a photographer or creative, Petra Collins is someone worth studying. She doesn\u2019t just take photographs she builds a world that feels soft, nostalgic, and a bit surreal, like a memory you didn\u2019t know you had.\n\nThis breakdown looks at how she does it not through complex lighting or gear, but through repeated, intentional choices that give her work that emotional pull.\n\nWe break down how she uses:\n\nWindows and blinds for layered framing\n\nColour that floods the entire image\n\nHarsh front light and lens flares\n\nConsistency across sets, styling, and composition\n\nIt\u2019s not about copying her style it\u2019s about understanding how to build your own. Because having a clear visual world is one of the most powerful things you can do as a photographer, art director, or stylist.\n\nIf you're trying to build a portfolio that actually stands out, this kind of visual thinking is what makes the difference.\nClients and collaborators respond to clarity and when your work feels like a world, people want to step into it.\n\nAll imagery shown is copyright Petra Collins (https://petra-collins.com), used here for educational and critical discussion.",

    "description": "Discover how Philip-Lorca diCorcia used carefully constructed scenes to create photographs that feel both documentary and fictional. This video explores how his approach to staging, lighting, and subject matter challenged traditional ideas of authenticity in photography.\n\nWe examine diCorcia\u2019s most important series including Hustlers, Heads, W Magazine, and East of Eden. From his earliest work, diCorcia showed an interest in performance, morality, and narrative tension. From using hidden strobes on the street to building cinematic fashion sets, his work pushed the limits of our perception of photography. \n\nPhilip-Lorca diCorcia built his reputation as one of the most distinctive voices in 1990s and early 2000s photography working in analogue film. His images feel cinematic, psychological, and sometimes unsettling, but always meticulously constructed. His iconic work navigated the tension between observation and orchestration.\n\nI really hope if you are new to his work you enjoy the journey of discovery ahead!\n\nall images used for educational purposes here are copyright Philip-Lorca diCorcia (unless stated as Winograd, Friedlander or Groover). \n\nYou may need to hit pause for some of the captions, editing this was a lot!\n\nFor more reading on PLDC try\nhttps://spruethmagers.com/artists/philip-lorca-dicorcia\nhttps://www.moma.org/artists/7027-philip-lorca-dicorcia\nhttps://americansuburbx.com/2015/08/philip-lorca-dicorcia-reflections-on-streetwork-1993-1997.html\nhttps://www.icaboston.org/art/philip-lorca-dicorcia/igor/",

    "description": "Alex Prager and Nadia Lee Cohen craft striking cinematic photography inspired by classic Hollywood, surrealism, and carefully curated character-driven imagery. This deep dive explores their bold use of colour, light, and storytelling, revealing how film influences their photographic worlds.\n\nFew photographers balance theatrical composition and cinematic storytelling as effectively as Alex Prager and the photographer she inspired, Nadia Lee Cohen. Their work exists in a space between fashion, portraiture, and narrative-driven imagery, evoking the feel of stills from an unknown film.\n\nThis video explores how Prager and Cohen use photography as a medium for visual storytelling, including:\n\nAlex Prager\u2019s Hitchcockian compositions and dramatic use of movement.\nNadia Lee Cohen\u2019s hyper-stylised portraits, bold lighting, and surreal colour palettes.\nHow both artists draw inspiration from 70s Hollywood, David Lynch, and iconic directors.\nThe cinematic techniques they apply to photography, from framing to character styling.\nWe also examine how their work bridges the gap between film, photography, and fashion, influencing a new generation of image-makers.\n\nBy the end of this deep dive, you\u2019ll gain insight into how these two photographers construct their distinctive, immersive visual worlds.\n\nThis is a compilation of my TikToks on Alex Prager and Nadia Lee Cohen.  \n\nI saw Alex Pragers first London exhibition 2008 and fell in love with the work, it had a huge impact on some UK photographers including Nadia Lee Cohen. \n\nNadia Lee Cohen, I take a look at her cinematic lighting and her use of narrative storytelling by taking the themes of directors she borrows heavily from in her early work. \n\nThe video finishes with 20s of inspirational movie scenes or lighting. \n\nI was recently asked to make my TikToks available to people who don't have the app, so this is what I am doing here. \n\nI know its not the ideal layout and but I cant post longform Portrait format videos, so hopefully this isn't super annoying.

    "description": "Capture One just introduced \"Match Look\"\u2014a one-click tool that lets photographers recreate the post-production style of any image. But how well does it actually work? In this video, I test it using a Jack Bridgland style low-res JPEG and an old TIFF file to see if it really holds up.\n\nCapture One recently released Match Look, a new feature that allows photographers to instantly replicate the colour, contrast, and tonal characteristics of any reference image. This could be a game-changer for workflow efficiency, but what does it mean for photographers who have spent years refining their own distinct visual style?\n\nIn this video, I put Match Look to the test, experimenting with:\n\nA Jack Bridgland low-res JPEG to see how it adapts to a high-contrast, bold aesthetic.\nAn older TIFF file to assess its accuracy on different formats.\nThe limitations and potential of this feature for real-world use.\n\n\nI\u2019ll be diving deeper into Match Look in a future video, but for now, here\u2019s my first impression: It\u2019s surprisingly effective even without further manual adjustment. But does it mean that signature editing styles can now be automated? There\u2019s a lot to discuss.\n\n#StudioLighting #CaptureOne #MatchLook #PhotographyEditing #PostProduction",

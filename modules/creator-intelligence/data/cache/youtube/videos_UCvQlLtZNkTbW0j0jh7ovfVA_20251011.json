This was a special edition piece, with details and improvements I\u2019ve never included before.\n\nSeeing the smile on Bob\u2019s face\u2026 hearing his kind words\u2026 watching my daughter witness that moment\u2014it was emotional, surreal, and incredibly humbling.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t just a prop delivery.\n\nIt was a full-circle moment, a love letter to the Haunted Mansion, and a dream come true for me as a lifelong Disney fan and maker.\n\nFrom my garage\u2026 to a Disney Legend\u2019s studio.\n\nThank you, Bob.

    "description": "Here\u2019s a throwback to one of my all-time favorite songs - Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen - brought to life in a whole new way! \ud83c\udf83\ud83c\udfb6\n\nThis project was a labor of love. There is NO external projector used in this project. Each pumpkin has it's own internal short throw projector hidden inside of it. These pumpkins can be placed anywhere and can be viewed from different angles without distortion.\n\nI created custom - carved pumpkin faces to match different singing phonemes, designed animated mouth movements, and synced everything to Queen\u2019s iconic track. Each of the 4 Mindscope 3D Jabbering Jack mini pumpkins plays a different part of the song, perfectly in sync with one another.\n\nIt took a lot of time, patience, and a bit of Halloween magic to pull it off, but I'm super proud of how it turned out. Hope you enjoy this musical Halloween tribute as much as I enjoyed creating it!\n\nItems used:\n\n4 Mindscope Jabbering Jack mini pumpkins\n\nCustom Power Supply with 4 outputs, so the pumpkins turn on at the same time\n\nCustom animation synced to vocals\n\nAudio split & video-mapped per pumpkin\n\n\ud83d\udc7b Let me know what song I should try next in the comments!\n\n\ud83d\udd16 Tags:\nqueen, bohemian rhapsody, bohemian rhapsody singing pumpkins, queen halloween show, jabbering jack pumpkins, animated pumpkins, halloween light show, queen bohemian rhapsody cover, halloween music light show, diy halloween decorations, pumpkin singing animation, halloween 2025 ideas, bohemian rhapsody halloween tribute, jabbering jack sync\n\n#\ufe0f\u20e3 Hashtags:\n#BohemianRhapsody #Queen #HalloweenShow #SingingPumpkins #JabberingJack #HalloweenDIY #PumpkinAnimation #LightShow #DIYLightGuy",

    "description": "Check out my latest project! I brought the Haunted Mansion's Grim Grinning Ghosts to life using carved pumpkin singing faces that I created \u2014 No External Projector needed!\n\nI created carved pumpkin faces based on different phonemes and designed a singing face animation. Then I synced the legendary Disney Haunted Mansion \u201csinging busts\u201d audio to the animation and uploaded it to 5 Mindscope 3D Jabbering Jack mini pumpkins. Each Pumpkin has its own video file, based on the character on the pumpkin. It was a little tricky, but I got all 5 pumpkins to synchronize together!\n\nThis version features scary faces, but I\u2019ll be testing traditional, funny, and mixed faces also to see which vibe works best. Let me know what you think\u2014do you like spooky, classic, or silly?\n\n\ud83d\udc7b\ud83c\udfb5\ud83c\udf83",

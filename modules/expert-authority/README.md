# Expert Authority Module

**Purpose:** Extract insights from expert discussions on Quora, Reddit, Stack Exchange, and technical forums where professionals discuss lighting, installation, and electrical topics.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Discover expert discussions
python scripts/forum_scraper.py --platform reddit --subreddit homeimprovement

# Analyze expert threads
python scripts/expert_analyzer.py --input data/raw/reddit_threads.json

# Generate authority report
python scripts/generate_expert_report.py
```

## Target Platforms

### Primary Sources
- **Reddit** - r/homeimprovement, r/electricians, r/lighting, r/DIY
- **Quora** - Lighting, electrical installation, home improvement spaces
- **Stack Exchange** - Home Improvement, DIY, Electronics

### Secondary Sources
- **Professional Forums** - Electrician Talk, Contractor Talk
- **Technical Communities** - Engineer's Edge, Physics Forums

## Analysis Pipeline

### Phase 1: Discovery & Collection
1. **Forum Scraping** - Collect threads matching lighting keywords
2. **Expert Identification** - Score users by karma, verified status, post history
3. **Thread Classification** - Pain points, solutions, product recommendations, warnings

### Phase 2: Authority Analysis
4. **Consensus Detection** - Identify widely-agreed solutions (upvotes, agreement language)
5. **Controversy Mapping** - Flag areas of expert disagreement
6. **Citation Extraction** - Pull verbatim expert quotes with attribution

### Phase 3: Insight Synthesis
7. **Authority Scoring** - Weight insights by expert credibility
8. **Pattern Clustering** - Group similar expert opinions
9. **Client Reporting** - Generate expert authority report with citations

## Key Metrics

### Expert Credibility Signals
- **Karma/Reputation** - Platform-specific reputation scores
- **Verified Status** - Professional flair, credentials
- **Post Quality** - Length, detail, technical accuracy
- **Peer Validation** - Upvotes, awards, agreement responses

### Insight Types
- **Consensus Solutions** - Widely-agreed best practices
- **Warning Signals** - Common mistakes, safety issues
- **Product Recommendations** - Expert-endorsed products
- **Controversial Topics** - Areas of disagreement
- **Emerging Trends** - New techniques, materials

## Output Files

### Raw Data (`data/raw/`)
- Platform-specific JSON files (reddit_threads.json, quora_answers.json)
- Timestamp, author, content, metadata (karma, upvotes)

### Processed Insights (`data/processed/`)
- `expert_insights.json` - Scored and categorized expert opinions
- `consensus_patterns.json` - Widely-agreed solutions
- `controversy_map.json` - Areas of expert disagreement

### Client Deliverables (`data/deliverables/`)
- `Expert_Authority_Report.html` - Cited expert insights
- `Consensus_vs_Controversy.html` - Agreement/disagreement analysis

## Evidence-First Principles

- **Verbatim Quotes Required** - All insights cited with source
- **Authority Scoring Transparent** - Show expert credibility metrics
- **Multiple Sources** - Validate across platforms when possible
- **Timestamp Citations** - Include discussion date for currency
- **Context Preservation** - Maintain original discussion thread context

## Technical Stack

- **Scraping** - PRAW (Reddit), Beautiful Soup (Quora/forums), Selenium (dynamic)
- **NLP** - Sentiment analysis, consensus detection, keyword extraction
- **Authority Scoring** - Multi-factor credibility algorithm
- **Storage** - JSON for raw data, processed insights

## Status

ðŸ“‹ **Planning Stage** - Module scaffolded, implementation pending

## Scope & Constraints

### In Scope
- Text-based expert discussions (Reddit, Quora, forums)
- Authority scoring based on platform metrics
- Consensus vs. controversy detection
- Verbatim citation extraction

### Out of Scope
- Video content from expert channels (use consumer-video module)
- Real-time monitoring (batch analysis only)
- Direct expert outreach/interviewing
- Paid/gated expert content

## Next Steps

1. Implement Reddit scraper (PRAW integration)
2. Design expert credibility scoring algorithm
3. Build consensus detection (NLP-based)
4. Create client report template
5. Validate on 3M lighting topics

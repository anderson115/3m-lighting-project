# Preflight Status - Brand Perceptions Data Collection

**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Status:** SIMPLIFIED APPROACH NEEDED

---

## Issue Identified

Initial plan called for:
- Reddit API (PRAW) - requires Reddit app registration
- YouTube API - requires Google Cloud project setup
- Twitter/X (Snscrape) - complex setup
- TikTok API - requires Playwright browser automation

**Reality Check:** Setting up 4 different APIs for a preflight test is over-engineered and violates our "simple & stable" principle.

---

## Revised Preflight Strategy

**SIMPLEST POSSIBLE APPROACH:** Use only tools Claude already has (WebSearch/WebFetch) to manually collect a tiny sample and test the checkpoint validation system.

### Preflight Goal (Revised):
1. Collect 10 data points manually using WebSearch/WebFetch
2. Structure them in JSON format
3. Run checkpoint validator to verify it works
4. **STOP** and show you the data + validation results

This tests the checkpoint infrastructure without complex API setup.

## Next Steps:

### Option A: Manual WebFetch Preflight (RECOMMENDED)
- Use WebFetch to extract 10 pieces of consumer feedback from accessible web pages
- Save to JSON
- Run checkpoint validator
- Show you results
- **Then** decide if we need full API setup or if WebSearch/WebFetch can handle Pass 1

### Option B: Full API Setup
- Set up Reddit app credentials
- Set up YouTube API credentials
- Test Twitter/X scraping
- Test TikTok scraping
- Run full preflight

---

## Recommendation:

**Go with Option A** - Manual WebFetch preflight to test infrastructure first, then scale up only if needed. This aligns with:
- ✅ Simple & stable principle
- ✅ Right-sized for scope
- ✅ Small sample before scale
- ✅ User evaluation at every step

**Your call:** Should I proceed with Option A (manual WebFetch preflight) or Option B (full API setup)?

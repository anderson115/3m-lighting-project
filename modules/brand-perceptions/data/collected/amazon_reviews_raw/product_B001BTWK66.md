These bundlers are perfect to keep the hose in place for the cpap machine. We struggled to keep the hose off the pillow area and the bundlers were the answer. We used the second bundler to keep our laundry bag from falling over when it starts to get ful. Glad they created this item.

I’ve had OCD for most my life..getting worse now; but at least we have command in this world & before they dropped the “Cable Organization Clip” with have a main home studio + smaller room studio for writing- I have..A LOT of cables & use @ 1/3 of them but feel I need more cause I..end up buying them later down the line even tho I thought I was good on cables...anyways I used to drill hooks & door hat hangers (which still works great if other door wasn’t different?) that was alot of work & patching up when moving sucked.
Finally, these cable clips by command, have saved me from a panic attack amount of messy cables and wasting time on minor home construction - when now I can use the time for..music :) thanks!

These don’t just work for cords! I bought new blue tooth headphones for my daughter (both from Amazon) & was thinking how I could store her headphones when not in use. I quickly got to looking at all the different command hooks & found these awesome things! Let me tell you, not only do these give her headphones a place to live while not in use, but they also help to act like a charging station & she gets to be like daddy and have her own blue tooth headphone station. Couldn’t be more happy!

These are great for managing my CPAP hose and parts. However, one did pull off the paint and top layer of paper on the drywall when I pulled the tap (slowly) to remove it when we painted the room. The rest were fine. It's odd. I still used them once we repaired the wall and painted. But just be aware that they may still cause damage.

These work great, especially if you are looking to replace an appliance cord wrap like I was. The cord wrap broke on my vacuum and I needed a way to keep the cord tidy. It adhered well to the back of my vacuum although it was a little big for the small space I needed it to fit. It’s been used about 60 times since I bought it and it’s staying on with no signs of wear on the rubber cord holder piece.

I am unable to comment on that, since I've only been able to use 4\", and my skull is warning me that is not enough.\nAs for sticking to cellophane wrapping, I can't imagine anything better. From trying to cut the cellophane off (don't bother even trying) to trying to roll some out (behaves like silly putty on steroids), the Extreme sticky stuff is in a permanent love affair with the packaging. I tried to entice the sticky rubber stuff, but even my artistic sign, with a promise of a permanent togetherness on the wall, couldn't convince the Extreme sticky stuff to break the bond with the cellophane.

It looked great and appear to be securely adhered for 3 days. Then 1 by 1 the prints started falling off the walls. I tried to pry the remaining ones off the wall and it ripped off parts of the dry wall paper backing. So the tape works, until it doesn\u2019t and there\u2019s no way to tell when the adhesion will give out. One frame fell on my arm and shattered, but thankfully didn\u2019t cut me. This frame is one of the cheap Michaels frames that are just a lightweight plastic bevel and a sheet of glass and yet it couldn\u2019t hold it up.",

It does a great job at both tasks.\n\nRemoving it is just a matter of getting a fingernail or razor blade under a corner and pulling it off from the side. Please note that when I spot tested it, it came off of metal, plastic, and tile without an issue, but putting it on a painted wall DID cause some damage to the paint. I used it on our painted wall because we're not planning to move, and I have no issue repainting if we ever do. If you're living in an apartment or a temporary situation and want to put something on a painted wall, this may not be the right choice for you.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the packaging is terrible. It comes in a plastic bag, which it sticks to, rather than in a bag made of something like the red liner. Because it's sticky on the side, and because pulling from the side is how such tapes are removed, taking it out of the bag causes some (admittedly minor) damage to the mounting tape. This is just sloppy and shows a lack of attention to detail by the manufacturer.",

The sides of the tape roll are so sticky that if you have it just lying around it's going to collect dust, dirt and debris...all of which would be annoying and difficult to pick off.\nThat being said, this is some SERIOUSLY sticky, strong tape. I've used it for hanging some command style hooks on my walls and they're holding up extremely well. None have fallen off so far!\nI'm not sure how easy they are to remove or if they leave any damage because I haven't tried to take any of the hooks down. Will update as needed.\nThis particular package comes with two rolls. At $10 I'd say this is a great value. You can't go wrong!",

A much more practical and effective version of a command strip. So far I\u2019ve used these much as the pictures they have in the listing, for the tools in the garage and they seem to hold well. I am waiting to paint the kids room and will hang up all of their pictures after. There\u2019s one notorious one that I could never hang with a command strip so I\u2019m excited to try it. Will post photos once I get everything up!\n*edited to add* I recently purchased a breakfast nook from Wayfair and I ended up using strips of this tape in between many pieces to help it stay together better...since the construction of the pieces itself were very shoddy.",

I've had to replace sections of the other tape with this tape and i've had no problems with this. I've used it to attach a pen holder to the wall, attach edges to the shade to my wall to keep light out in my office, attach a piece of foam at the edges of my air conditioners. So I used the tape for multiple things and it's worked great each time.",

First, I arranged the photos how I wanted them. Then I flipped them over and stuch a small square of tape in the center of the back of each photo. Next, I peeled the backing off of the other side of tape and stuck it where I wanted it. It was easy to reposition the photos as needed. It was strong enough to hold the photo. The photo display was for my son\u2018s graduation party. It was easy to reposition the photos, and they did not fall off. This is perfect for indoor use. I do not know how it would hold up in wind or rain. For windy conditions maybe you would do something on each of the four corners of the photos instead. Once the photos were mounted, I was able to easily hang the canvas from a nail on my wall.\nI don\u2019t think I would use this on antique or vintage photos that you want to preserve. All of my photos were printed at Walgreens from my phone.",

Whether I'm hanging lightweight items on my walls that don\u2019t need nails, drywall anchors, or screws, this Scotch-Mount tape gets the job done without a hitch. It's reliable, easy to use, and has become an essential item in my home.\n\nBut be weary! While it\u2019s fantastic for little jobs, don\u2019t expect it to hold up larger items, especially if you're stubborn like me. I tried hanging a bigger piece\u2014out of impatience, not wanting to deal with the necessary wall anchors\u2014and within minutes, I heard a loud crash as it fell from the wall. So, little jobs? YES. Hanging a picture nearly half the size of your wall? NO.\n\nAs I write this, I\u2019m sadly down to about 4-5 inches of tape, holding on to it like a desperate hoarder, but trust me, for smaller tasks, this tape is a total lifesaver. Highly recommend it, but maybe not for your most ambitious hanging projects!",

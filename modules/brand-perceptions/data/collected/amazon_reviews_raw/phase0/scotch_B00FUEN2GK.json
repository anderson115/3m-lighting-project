I used this to attach a new flag to my mailbox and it has been happily baking in the Texas sun day after day ever since...it'll probably outlast the flag, itself! haha\n\nI have noticed that this tape's bond increases a bit in the first few hours from the time of application, as it begins to chemically bond to the surfaces (in some cases). In other words, it's easier to remove/change if you do so soon after mounting. If you do need to ever remove it, it will take a thin razor blade, Isopropyl alcohol, some twisting/prying/peeling, and lots of patience. Use with caution; it will \"literally rip a chunk out of drywall,\" according to a friend who didn't heed my warnings. haha",

    "review_text": "This is a review of the Scotch-Mount Double Sided Mounting Tape Heavy Duty. It was disappointing.\n\nThe item information in Amazon claims that this product is 'heavy duty' and can be expected to hold up to 30 pounds. Now I realize there are caveats to that statement; saying it holds \"up to\" 30 pounds means it will not hold anything OVER 30 pounds, but it doesn't preclude the fact that it might not hold up anything 3 pounds either. That statement is advertising double-talk.\n\nThey recommend 2 inches of the tape for a 1 pound weight. I needed to attach an item (barely1 pound) to a wall, I used far more than 2 inches of the tape, and it stayed put for a week before it crashed to the ground. Not what I would expect from a Scotch item. Lucky for me, the item didn't vaporize when it hit the pavement, and I reattached it yesterday using screws, which are very unlikely to fall out.\n\nMy verdict: 3 stars.",

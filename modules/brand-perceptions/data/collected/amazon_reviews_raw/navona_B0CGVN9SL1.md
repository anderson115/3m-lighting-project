## Solid
**Rating:** 4.0 out of 5 stars
**Author:** Jay P
**Date:** Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2025
✅ Verified Purchase

Used almost the entire box for a Halloween costume project, primarily to hold EVA foam pieces together. The sheer amount of product is the value here. For the most part it does the job. I did experience some inconsistent performance with more weight-bearing applications, both with the hook and loop as well as with the adhesive. I won't be pulling apart the attached pieces apart often, if at all, but I would have reasonable concerns about the long-term sticking power (hook and loop - and - adhesive) if I did. I've used other brands before that I trusted that are no longer available, and while I would buy this item again, my level of confidence isn't quite as high. But, for semi-permanent usage with minimal weight-bearing, it's solid.

## Great to keep outdoor cushions in place!

**Author:** Kelli

I purchased hook and loop strips for our outdoor couch/patio furniture to help prevent the wind from tossing the cushions off the furniture. I've tried other brands but they didn’t provide a strong enough hold. Since using this, we haven't had any issues with the velcro detaching from the cushions or the furniture. Everything has stayed in place. I appreciate the large size and strength of the hook and loop strips. You get a lot for the price.

## If you're hanging art? These probably aren't for you.
**Rating:** 3.0 out of 5 stars
**Author:** H. A.
**Date:** Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2025
✅ Verified Purchase

If you're like me and have a ton of art to hang, you might be looking for a Command Strip alternative that isn't as expensive. Unfortunately, these don't quite fit the bill.

They might be great for mounting other things, or securing carpets etc, but if you're trying to hang frames (light ones, even!), these will not be a suitable alternative to Command Strips for the vast majority of what you need to hang.

Pros:
Very sticky.
Don't seem to damage walls unless the paint is already kind of sketchy, which is a big deal!

Unfortunately, these just didn't serve my needs, and despite lots of reviews, I really had to post this one. I've had several pieces of art just fall off the wall out of nowhere, and that's really frustrating. No breakage yet, but I'm not going to be waiting to see if that happens. I'll just be spending the money on big Command Strip.

This is holding up well. I needed to replace the velcro that holds my garage door cover decoration. After cleaning the surface, I attached this. It's been on my garage for nearly a month now and is holding well. We've had a few 100 degree days and it hasn't failed. I also tried on brick, just to see if it would hold some Halloween decorations and so far so good!

I use Velcro tape so often that I'm honestly surprised I never thought of getting some off Amazon before. Its strong good for what I'm using it for. the adhesive is good and the Velcro is good. The Velcro has not worn out on my project yet and I'm making this review a few months after purchasing it, and it came with quite a bit! I still have more left over for other projects which is more then I can say about the packs I used to get from home depot 👍

This review is for a 30’ x 1” Hook and Loop Strips with Adhesive. I have a craft table and want to hide what is underneath, so I got a skirt to wrap around it. The only issue was there was no way to adhere the material to the table, which is why I purchased this hook and loop. The adhesive backing is strong and reliable, and kept the material in place, and the white color blends well with the material. I like and recommend this hook and loop strips for anyone looking to fasten and keep their project in place.

This have come in handy on so many projects.ni live that it has the measurements on the actual Velcro so you know how much to cut for each side. We haven’t done so many projects with this one pack of Velcro and we still have over half left over. You can cut them in half if you need a thin strip or leave them as is and they are perfect for so many projects! Dave’s my falls from being full of holes when you don’t need a strong or heavy hold. The quality is great and would highly recommend. I added this to my cart again and just put it in the save for later cart so when we use up this box I can purchase again. I can’t tell you how handily this has been and so happy with this purchase!

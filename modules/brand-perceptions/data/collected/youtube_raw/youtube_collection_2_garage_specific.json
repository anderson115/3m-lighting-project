Because it has to be anchored away from the wall, you\u2019ll have to trim each section, which takes away hook placement.

He has not harmed you by publishing a video of a product. He is just trying to make a living in a world of financial uncertainty. And look. You don\u2019t have to buy the product.

Because you don't need to mine/refine as much anymore. The steel that's used in every tool/car/bridge/road sign is the same steel they took out of the ground to make fighter planes in ww2. \n\nFun fact: manufacturers of Geiger counters and other radiation detection equipment use steel from sunken ww1&2 era ships. Reason being, after the atomic bombings in Japan, and all the subsequent cold war atomic tests, there's no material left on the planet that's not slightly radioactive. If they used regular steel those detectors wouldn't work because they'd just detect themselves.",

    "text": "Wall anchors and toggle bolts are not bad options whatsoever\u2026.its simply that people underestimate the weight that will hang their, and install them incorrectly 80% of the time.\n\n  1.) Wall anchors - the golden rule here is called \u201cpower of 3\u201d, which simply means that whatever weight you believe needs to hang from the anchor, get one that can hold triple that weight.\n   Secondly, choose a pilot hole but that is barely smaller than the anchor size. This way, you can tap the anchor into the wall with a rubber mallet so it is snug, secure, and has zero wiggle room, thereby insuring the screw expands and gains maximum outward tension against the drywall.\n\n2.) Toggle bolts - for starters, accurately discern what length of machine screw is needed for the distance between the drywall and whatever is being fastened to it. Getting a 4\u201d toggle bolt for standard 5/8 drywall is overkill and the screw could punch through something you can\u2019t see going in.\n\n   Secondly, the power of 3 still applies. If I\u2019m hanging a 40 pound TV wall mount bracket, I\u2019ll use 4 or 5 quarter inch toggle bolts. One of these can home up to 80-120 lbs a piece. Using 5 in a rectangle formation with one in the middle can now handle 500 plus pounds.\n   God himself would struggle removing it.\n\n  Finally, buy your wall anchors and toggle bolts from an online specialty fastener store like Uline, Fastenal, or Grainger. They are head and shoulders above Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s, will last forever, and a come in packs small or large enough for any usage.\n\n  Wall anchor and toggle bolts are not inferior, the people whose ignorance about installation and placement technique generally are.",

    "text": "I wonder about the effect on the house with putting screws into the studs. It seems it would be better to add extra studs, perhaps with minimal screws + construction adhesive or wood glue, alongside construction studs & then a mounting plate onto the dummy studs??  I'd like a video on this issue. I see some youtube videos involving installations with huge lag bolts into studs, that I instantly thought was a horrible idea; just by a sense of the matter. (I also came to realize a mounting plate makes better sense than screwing into studs, once I learned about the directional strength of wood- if your mounting plate wood grain runs horizontal, unlike studs running vertically- which is the direction wood likes to split).",

One thing I added which I think is lacking in the vid; I \"doubled\" every lenght of leg with a piece taht sits underneath the shelf it is supporting, like for a window sill in framing, rather than only one piece against the shelf as in the video. As is in the vieo, the screws are the only thing supporting the weight, add load, stress/movement when using the bench or loading/unloading, plus a few years of expanding/retracting wood with the seasons, and I'm afraid everything will start wobbling. I also glued everything on top of screwing, for the same reason.",

    "text": "The top two shelves should have been configured like the work bench 4/8/4 rather than 8/8.   it makes no sense to have two cantilevers meet in  the middle rather than a solid span above the bench with two 4' wide towers on each side. \nBins can be stacked.  The top shelf is not necessary.  And it's omission would allow the header above the bench to be raised  5\" to avoid head bumps.   \nA bench height of 38' to 44\" is more ergonomic for standing work and provides space for two roomy shelves under the bench.\nUsing wall studs for support is efficient provided fasteners shear strength exceeds loads.  Rec 4 1/2\" lag screws.",

    "text": "I am thinking about your plans, but have a question.  \n\nQ1. What is the maximum height for an item placed inside the double height drawer?   \nQ2. And likewise, what's the maximum height for an item placed inside the single height drawer?   (I think if you answer question one accurately I can figure out this one ;-) )\n\nI'm gonna assume the double height drawer is double the height of the first one because it certainly looks that way.  The reason I ask is that at the beginning of your video you state that the stretchers are 3\" high, yet at about 23:35 mins in your video the height of the uprights with your red square is 2.75 inches.   I realize that you have gaps in the top and the bottom, but there is no measurement there.  I am asking because the stuff I have to insert in the double height drawers will be very, very close to the height within a quarter of an inch or less.     I am aware that I can modify your plans and I'm capable of doing that, but the reason for buying them is to not have to do the math and draw all this stuff out.  Which is the very reason you are selling them.  ;-)   I did go to your website too, but the measurements are not listed.  It might be a good idea to list the entire inner dimensions of each drawer because I'm pretty certain there are other folks out there that will want to know this.  \n\nThanks for the input and as you can tell, I did watch your entire video.",

Where you have wood sliding on wood, you'll want to wax both surfaces. Having used candle wax and carnauba car wax, I recommend the latter.  The car wax (unbuffed) will stand up to hot days, friction, and is the hardest wax you can get.  It will seal the wood keeping it from swelling and last years.  Use two to three coats letting it dry between coats.\nPam   {Tom's wife}  \ud83e\udd3f",

    "text": "I very much don't align with the \"pinky knuckle\" advice for bench height. Maybe there's more to consider with torso/arm lengths because if I followed that advice it would have me leaning over an uncomfortable amount even if I were planing 8/4 stock. I can feel my lats engaging just from getting into position to plane at that height. \n\nI'm not saying it's not great advice for most, but if you are oddly proportioned like me (I'm like 25.5\" pant inseam, 6'1\") you might want to really consider starting higher. \n\nI started at 40\", but 38\" is where I landed. I'm considering going another 0.5\" lower, but giving it more time before committing.",

The weakest methods either got replaced or went out of business,  so what the old fart traditionalists know is the combined knowledge of thousands  of craftsmen over as many years... You're gonna have to be exceptionally smart to come up with something better. AND have  about \u00bd a life of experience just to know the effects of the downsides. Including those you don't see in your blind spot. That goes for exceptionally smart people as well. So while our society has advanced thousandfold or more in some areas, other are so simple, yet so complex and interconnected, bound by physics and nature, that in 99.9% of cases, you'll end up straight back with what you tried to run away from or avoid. Because it works. And out of all the millions of alternatives,  that one won. For good reason.",

    "text": "Your first statement was me. I bought my first home and said, \"I have a house, I need a workbench!\" Long story short, my top rested on the four corners and not the supports running between the corners, or the middle support I added. When I figured that out, I had to use some plastic shims and now at least the supports are offering support to the top. \ud83d\ude05\n\nI just learned my \"supports\" are actually called \"stretchers\". :D\n\nAND... I used carriage bolts and nuts and I've had to tighten mine too!!!!! \ud83d\ude04  Where were you 4 years ago when I bought my house? Oh, this video was already made, I just didn't know about it. hah  Mine is similar to the half lap joint you're describing. Except I used 2x6s instead of what looks like 4x4s and the stretcher is completely supported by two bolts through the 4x4 leg post. It kind of looks like the image at 18:30, only mine has a bunch of shims. \n\nThis is a fun video!!",

    "text": "My first basic workbench was a sheet of 72x36 plywood sitting on a couple 2x4s across 2 saw horses. Not good, except for assembling, painting, and finishing. My first big bench (in my garage) was a sturdy 2x4 frame with a 3/4 plywood surface screwed on. It sat on 2 Keter workhorse folding workstations. 8 legs made the work bench stable in every direction, it could hold 700 pounds, and it could be folded up and stored easily. The top hangs on the wall of the garage.  When the plywood top gets banged up, flip it over and you have a new surface. When that side gets banged up, it's time for a new sheet. (inexpensive) I have a clamp-on vise that works very well, and can be removed in seconds.",

    "text": "Mr Krueger, I have watched about a dozen of your videos but that promise to \u2018not let those problems happen to you\u201d finally won my clicking suscribe. There were three questions I had in regards to my bench that I wanted answered before I finish my plans and started building, the first was leg joinery I have been debating between a half lap and a laminated mortise and tenon (where the beam for the mortise is made from three laminated 2x4s) I am going with the mortise and tenon option. Second was on bench \u201clength\u201d as you call it (my learning is mostly from drafting so I would call it width and what you called width I\u2019d call depth). Third question was about cross braces as in whether or not I needed them. thanks to your video I have decided the answer is yes at lest for the front and back, currently the bench is 14\u201d deep with a plan to make it 20\u201d in a few months (once I figure out if I am a good shop manager that puts tools away or a chaos gremlin that needs a tool trough.) Most of my past work bench experience is from shop class and carving. You also answered a question I didn\u2019t even know I had which was in regards to a vice. However you are making me second guess my height. I\u2019m 5\u20196, in the past for carving I have worked at 35\u201d and for all the other stuff I\u2019ve worked at kitchen counter height which I hated I was thinking 34-35\u201d for the bench. I think I am still going to start there after all my dad has a circular saw that can take care of the finer tuning, in a perfect world I\u2019d have the money and skill to build a height changing one. But hey that can be a goal.",

I can probably build one on my own, but I don't know the ins and outs of what type of helpful features it should have and I'm sure I will over look them. If you don't have a video, do you know of a work bench video you have seen that you like that you can direct me to the video.\n\nThanks for your video and if you have time to answer my question.

    "text": "I came here to check out if there even was a project farm clip  on double sided tape..I am glad that there is an inexpensive tape which might do the job which I am trying to do cause it might take a lot of trial and error. ( further reading optional)\n I Wish I knew how they work on paper l like fabric like that is found in adult undergarments I am currently looking for a double sided tape to tape a super absorbent liner into an adult diaper to act as a guard.  I have heard that 3m auto trim tape is a super heavy duty double sided tape that also is water proof... yet I am not willing to go to that extreme. Yet...  I tried the 3m 1 inch heavy duty gray foam double sided tape... it did not last 30 seconds and you could pull apart the liner from the undergarment way to easily ( it practically fell off) probably due to the porous or fibrous nature of the materials surface... which is an interesting point to mention because  if these tapes were tested with something like wood to brick or wood to concrete it might likely show a lesser amount of force that it would take to pull the wood block off of the brick or piece of concrete. However this clip did reveal a good inexpensive tape that I may also try to use in my efforts to make a super adult absorbent disposable diaper... So thanks project farm....as  I am basically going mad scientist crazy trying to get back a discontinued product that use to work in one fashion and team it with something else to possibly make a super diaper.... It probably won't be cost effective but just as long as it works in the case and circumstances that I am witnessing ( and cleaning up after )  this clip may prove to help me out...",

    "text": "Very good testing video. I like the fact that rubber mounting tape is softer and can mold and stick well to textured surface. The problem though it stretches and unstick itself in high temperature. I mounted a modem to my truck upside down and had to put tie ropes to catch it. The tape would stop sticking in summer when it goes above 80 degrees inside the truck the heat generated from the device would make it worse. I could use acrylic adhesive tape but it does not work well with textured surface even though I prep the surface well wiping with alcohol.",

It\u2019s more expensive, but it\u2019s the best thing for tarps . Old duct tape. Can come off become brittle with time this thing I put it on one and a half years ago . And still good . Unlike duct tape you can't tear it with your hands it needs a knife to cut it . Be careful , it's super sticky don't let it get on anything you don't want to tape and the white back paper doesn't always peel off very cleanly",

If you have any ideas on this let me know. I am planning on giving it a try over the next few evenings after work. I will update as to how it goes.\n\nUpdate. AMAZING WORKBENCH! I did go with different dimensions and I am beyond happy with how it turned out since moving to a new house we have so much garage space it only made sense to make a large table since we end up spending half of our time on the floor building large projects so this will eliminate that! I completed this project in only 5 hours. I only did 6 legs just like in the video, I have yet to add the deck boards for lower storage due to the fact I could only fit so much wood in the jeep. Dimensions I went with:\nTable top: 5.5'x12'\nTable height 38\"\n\nLumber Used:\nTen 2x6x12' (for the table top)\nThree 4x4x12' (legs cut to 36\" and support beams going between legs on the lower half cut to 54\")\nEight 2x4x12' (support for the table to to rest on and going the long way between the legs I also added one more going between the legs the long way down the middle)\nTwo 1x2x12' (for support where the deck boards will rest on)\n\nI still need to go and buy the deck boards for the lower support but what I will need is:\ntwenty four 1-1/4x6x6'",

Those top boards don't look flat which will create all kinds of problems for future projects built on that bench. And the plywood will stay flat over time vs. the boards.",

A tip for people doing this, i made a little L shaped jig out of scrap wood to hang over the bottom 2x4, exactly as deep as the deck boards so that when i screwed in the bottom shelf supports i made them tight against my jig so it was exactly as deep as it needed to be. This takes out the making sure your measurements are perfect on every single spot your screw in the 1x1s",

If you watch \"How to Notch Wood with a Miter Saw?\" by Easy Woodworking, he explains it pretty well. Im sure you could use a hand saw to achieve the same result but that, in my opinion, is more work than a miter or table saw is worth.",

    "text": "Thank you for this video. We moved a few years ago and all my tools were just thrown into the garage. Now that it's warm enough to work outside, I've been trying to organize the garage and set up my tools again. I knew I needed a proper workbench, and since I haven't spent much time building things, I was hoping to find something simple. THIS build checked all the boxes. I made mine 10' long and a few inches taller. It worked out perfectly. Lumber in our small town is way overpriced so I only had to buy some 4x4 and 1 10' 2x4 because I only had 3 @16'. I had some salvaged tongue and groove boards that I used instead of the deck boards. I couldn't believe it when they fit almost perfectly after cutting off the tongue edge for each side of the table. I didn't have to rip any boards. Also my hardware store didn't have 5/16 lag screws at 5\" long so I had to use 3/8. They were a little harder to tighten with my impact (even after predrilling the holes), but everything worked out great. Building this table has really improved my confidence and drastically increased my motivation to get back to work. \n\nThank you very much!",

    "text": "I am not a mechanical engineer. However, I feel many people commenting may be missing the fact that the uni strut is suspended over multiple truss. This IMO should spread out the weight across the various trusses. .... But I am not positive on this. Let me know if this sounds correct: If you are lifting 1,000 pounds then the weight across 5 trusses should be 200 pounds each???  I am going to try this in my shed. But I did modify my truss with a rafter going across first (extending over the top of the wall plates, hope this is sufficient. I am only planning on lifting maybe 400-600 pounds.  The other thing is there are the clamps around the uni strut, which should help prevent the uni strut channel from spreading.",

With the plywood shadow box you are stuck with your custom tool holders only for that tool and would have to modify it or make a different one for other tools.",

    "text": "Hello -\n\nThank you for choosing the 3M CLAW\u2122 Drywall Picture Hanger. If one of your hangers feels loose and can be removed with minimal effort, we recommend not using it for your mirror. For best performance, the hardened steel claws need to fully engage with the drywall. You can remove the loose hanger and reinstall a new one a few inches away from the original holes, as installing too close could weaken the drywall in that spot. Please also ensure the hanger is installed exactly as shown in the instructions, with firm, even pressure so the claws bite securely into the surface. You can view our step-by-step installation guide here for the best results: https://s.3m.com/oxhf5r3h\n\nWe hope this helps!\n",

    "text": "Hello Frank -\n\nThank you for your query. The 3M CLAW\u2122 Drywall Picture Hanger securely holds objects on drywall, but its effectiveness for a phone box depends on weight, surface, and movement. Ensure the total weight is within the hanger\u2019s limit (15-45 lbs). It works only on drywall, not wood, metal, or tile. Frequent opening and closing may cause shifting, so additional stabilization might be needed. Since it uses steel claws instead of adhesive, a more secure mounting method like screws or a hinged bracket may be better for a flush, frequently used box.\n\nWe hope this information helps!",

They are built to hold drywall, and not much else. 10lbs per square foot is the standard for roof truss bottom chords. \n\nAs a carpenter, you should know this. You never mentioned this fact a single time in this video. \nYou've given permission to people to hang as much weight as they want from their ceiling, never once warning them that it's only ok when the framing they are attaching to are joists or rafters... \n\nFor this serious omission, I give this video an F.",

    "text": "Thank you for this, it's very clear and informative! \nI've been wanting to add three small hooks for pot plants (10cm diameter max, lightweight plastic pots) and few hooks to carry vining sections across the ceiling. But, I live in a modern, fairly high density apartment building on the first floor. There are three floors above me, one below, and two basement layers beyond that - and every time I've stuck my head through the manhole, there's not a single wooden joist to be seen. My best assessment is that my ceiling has metal framework and railings, all upon suspended bolts from a concrete slab (the next floor above). At least, thats how it appears to me. Any tips for a framework like that? I assume the winged options will work best in the plasterboard for the lightest sections, other than that I am stumped! Rather tempted to remove a chunk and see what I can do with the railings, but I think my partner will have kittens if she sees me attempt it!",

Pre-drill your joist (and use a Drill not an impact, it will over torque your threads and them weaker). It has internal threads that you can use threaded rod with. They make it for all your standard hardware sizes, but 3/8 will do just about everything you need it to. It\u2019s a great price of hard ware. Deep strut is also a good one, as it\u2019s also considered a framing material.",

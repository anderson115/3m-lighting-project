The way you did it, it seems to me you don't gain anything. Why not skip the unistruts and use the entire wall to hang tools? Or, do you have shelves on casters or something like that that occupy the space when you slide both movable tool walls to the left? What am I missing? Don't get me wrong, I see the potential for this to be a great space-saving solution, but I don't see it in this case",

    "text": "Very nice build.  I would suggest in a future build to add a T-strap to the attachment points holding the plywood to the roller hangers.  This would add strength to the places where the bolts go through the plywood, depending on the weight of tools that are hung on the board, especially if a thinner board than what is shown in this video is used.  Thanks for sharing.",

This could give me far more useable space and help me keep track of everything.  This would be perfect for my back wall so I can fit my vehicles in the garage all the way.  I have a scaffolding system so I could increase my storage, but it\u2019s a good looking mess that ensures I\u2019m going to be frustrated and takes up a few feet making it not possible to close my garage door when working on a vehicle. This could fix both problems and look amazing.  \ud83e\udd29",

    "text": "Hey fantastic idea and good video but as a suggestion Your tightly wrapping power cords of all your corded power tools is damaging to cord ,hanging them by their cord also making them potentially dangerous to use . What happened to a piece of metal if you bend it back and forth in the same place it breaks same with hanging it not designed to carry its own weight indefinitely . Damaged wires in a cord increase resistance meaning your tool may not get its full potential of current or worse catch fire due to heat building up in the wires",

    "text": "Hello -\n\nThank you for choosing the 3M CLAW\u2122 Drywall Picture Hanger. If one of your hangers feels loose and can be removed with minimal effort, we recommend not using it for your mirror. For best performance, the hardened steel claws need to fully engage with the drywall. You can remove the loose hanger and reinstall a new one a few inches away from the original holes, as installing too close could weaken the drywall in that spot. Please also ensure the hanger is installed exactly as shown in the instructions, with firm, even pressure so the claws bite securely into the surface. You can view our step-by-step installation guide here for the best results: https://s.3m.com/oxhf5r3h\n\nWe hope this helps!\n",

The 3M CLAW\u2122 Drywall Picture Hanger securely holds objects on drywall, but its effectiveness for a phone box depends on weight, surface, and movement. Ensure the total weight is within the hanger\u2019s limit (15-45 lbs). It works only on drywall, not wood, metal, or tile. Frequent opening and closing may cause shifting, so additional stabilization might be needed. Since it uses steel claws instead of adhesive, a more secure mounting method like screws or a hinged bracket may be better for a flush, frequently used box.\n\nWe hope this information helps!",

They are built to hold drywall, and not much else. 10lbs per square foot is the standard for roof truss bottom chords. \n\nAs a carpenter, you should know this. You never mentioned this fact a single time in this video. \nYou've given permission to people to hang as much weight as they want from their ceiling, never once warning them that it's only ok when the framing they are attaching to are joists or rafters... \n\nFor this serious omission, I give this video an F.",

    "text": "Thank you for this, it's very clear and informative! \nI've been wanting to add three small hooks for pot plants (10cm diameter max, lightweight plastic pots) and few hooks to carry vining sections across the ceiling. But, I live in a modern, fairly high density apartment building on the first floor. There are three floors above me, one below, and two basement layers beyond that - and every time I've stuck my head through the manhole, there's not a single wooden joist to be seen. My best assessment is that my ceiling has metal framework and railings, all upon suspended bolts from a concrete slab (the next floor above). At least, thats how it appears to me. Any tips for a framework like that? I assume the winged options will work best in the plasterboard for the lightest sections, other than that I am stumped! Rather tempted to remove a chunk and see what I can do with the railings, but I think my partner will have kittens if she sees me attempt it!",

    "text": "Hi Lou. You skipped one step that is listed in the product instructions (on cover of package). This is the step after you remove the black liner and press to wall for 10 seconds. It  reads to slide the hook up and off and then to press the base firmly for 30 seconds. And only then to slide the hook back on. And  also they say to wait 1 hour before use. I guess to allow the adhesive to dry and hold strong.",

    "text": "This video got a couple things wrong.  #1, he applied the strip upside down ... do it with tab on the bottom to obscure the removal tab and then when you slide the hook over the backing plate, it won't be as noticeable, #2 after placing the strip on the wall, carefully remove the hook from the backing plate and press it firmly against the surface for at least a minute and #3 ALWAYS clean the surface you are applying the hook to with 90+% rubbing alcohol to clean it and let it dry before adhering - and apply a small drop to the area first to make sure it wont remove or discolor your paint - if you do not do this you will inevitably experience the hook ripping off the wall (likely with some of your drywall) at some point.  This is a great product, but it will not hold any amount of weight for you unless you do these things.",

As we near the end of the first summer with pegboard walls, it's all warped and drooping depending on the weight of tools, so this winter's project will likely be a French cleat wall!",

Added a third one to the top of the frame. Stuck for a minute. Then it fell off. Even tried adding a fourth and it wasn't even going to stick to the wall. So now I'm entirely pissed off that I just wasted $20 that I can't really spare on these stupid things.",

    "text": "+Mikel Kd - \"quick fix\"  -- That's pretty misleading as it would only take about 4 minutes more to have put up a sheet of Pegboard, particularly on a wall with wooden studs as opposed to a concrete block garage wall.  Simply nail up some 1x2\" furring strips onto the studs, then use some 3/4\" screws to attach the pegboard to the strips.\n\n$19 for a sheet of pegboard is just too cheap and easy an alternative to use instead.  You end up with:\n\na. More flexible uses: you can quickly move the pegs anywhere as tools change or are added over 32 square feet of storage on just a single sheet\nb. Better use of the wall space: 2x4s waste a ton of wall space by definition if you hang anything other than these full length tools, that's why he only shows them being hung.  So now you can also put all the small but regularly used tools at quick reach, like hammers or even screwdrivers with an inexpensive or even homemade mount for them.\nc. Something that adds resale value to the home instead of looking like it was built by the Beverly Hillbillies.\n\nA single sheet of pegboard would add 5 times the useful storage that this design provides, and for no real effort or time more, and barely much cost difference for a homeowner.",

A great example of this is bike storage. For some people, those hoist systems are perfect. For others hooks are perfect. For me, neither are good or optimal or even an option. I also have 7 bikes to hang in a very small space. But again, for someone else, it could not be more perfect",

    "text": "The rolling tool chests have evolved and work very efficiently, for a few key reasons: 1) the drawers are a good size to visually scan, and depth fits a great majority of standard tools. Liners and some internal organizing is all one needs to learn what goes where without over-organizing and wasting space; 2) more small cabinets can fit on top, and drawers are at or below eye level, a real problem for built-in shelving and cabinets over work areas. 3) Most drawers fully extend, and are very strong even loaded with tools. 4) You can move them nearer, or away, from areas, and unlike tray systems, aren't likely to tip over. The metal construction is rigid, but thinner than any wood drawer systems, which are heavy and usually built semi-permanently, demanding a lot of pre-planning design.\n  If your shop is for miscellaneous repair and DIY work, not woodworking, building out a full storage and wall system is impractical and costly, without all the wood tools needed.",

That's what I have in my garage, all the long things hang from that.\n\nYou make a good point about being locked into a brand with some systems.  In my opinion, no one should buy into any system that is brand specific, if for no reason other than it will eventually be cancelled.  Use plywood, cabinets, cleats, pegboard, open shelving.  If there aren't many companies making the product, you're both stuck and paying too much.",

    "text": "\"Enjoy\" your video? No. I found it incredibly depressing. If these are my only realistic options, I'll NEVER get my workshop organized. I've already got my tool density almost a full order of magnitude more dense than yours and still can't seem to efficiently organize: a 19\" bandsaw, 2 bench-grinders, a miter saw, a 7\"x21\" lathe with associated rests, chucks, & vices, a combo disc & belt sander, vacuum cleaner, dust collector,  ultrasonic cleaner, 15 gallon air compressor, an assortment of handheld power tools (Sawzall (2), impact driver (2), cordless drill (2), dremel, heat guns (2), angle grinder (2), portable belt sanders (2)), a collection of clamps, bench vice, a drill press, a full set of hand tools (wrenches (SAE & Metric), sockets (SAE & Metric), ratchets, power bars, torque wrenches, screwdrivers, numerous hammers, allen wrenches, saws, various cutting tools, pliers, tin snips, bolt cutters, riveters, staplers, hot glue guns), propane torches, precision measuring tools (calipers, micrometers, runout gauges + support hardware, levels, squares), taps (SAE & Metric), dies (SAE & Metric), punches, chisels, soldering irons, multimeters, along with all the replaceable cutting/sanding (sandpaper, steel wool, blades, cutting wheels, grinding discs, bandsaw blades, sanding belts & discs, drill bits, razor blades, lathe cutting tools, mill ends, vacuum filters, etc.) consumables. PLUS various raw materials (wood, metal, plastic, wire, rope, screen, nuts, bolts, nails, specialty fasteners, rivets, staples) used to create things. Also, all the lubricants, glues, solvents, & cleaning solutions to support projects. My workspace is 10' by 20'. Two ends can't be used because one is a garage door, & the other is a walkway. Oh, I forgot airless painter, paint, drywall related patch stuff. I'm not including my numerous shovels, picks, pruners, leaf blowers, edgers, hedge trimmers, chainsaws, machetes, rakes, brooms, string trimmers, loppers, sledge hammers, etc., which I have organized into a 1.5'x1.5'x8' space. None of those systems you showed seemingly could accommodate my collection of tools & materials, leaving me depressed. Your demonstration of a broom & shovel wall hanging solution made me laugh. I have over 5X the number of tools in that category you showed I've got it packed into that 1.5'x1.5' space I mentioned. I want to get everything neatly organized. I fix stuff, & I make stuff. I also do my own gardening. I tend to work more with metal than wood, but I have the tools for both. Oh, I also forgot what I call my specialty tools: borescope, lasers, label printers, magnifying glasses, temperature measurement tools, and on and on. Oh, I also have a portapower with dies. When I was a little kid my father told me \"A man has to be able to fix anything.\" I took that to heart. He might have just been joking. Dunno. I was just a kid. I sure as heck can fix way more than he ever could.",

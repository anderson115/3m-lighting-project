Or, do you have shelves on casters or something like that that occupy the space when you slide both movable tool walls to the left? What am I missing?

What happened to a piece of metal if you bend it back and forth in the same place it breaks same with hanging it not designed to carry its own weight indefinitely . Damaged wires in a cord increase resistance meaning your tool may not get its full potential of current or worse catch fire due to heat building up in the wires",

Pegboard seemed simple, but what they neglect to tell you is that mdf is very susceptible to humidity, living in Eastern Canada 100% humidity is a normal day in summer. As we near the end of the first summer with pegboard walls, it's all warped and drooping depending on the weight of tools, so this winter's project will likely be a French cleat wall!",

    "text": "+Mikel Kd - \"quick fix\"  -- That's pretty misleading as it would only take about 4 minutes more to have put up a sheet of Pegboard, particularly on a wall with wooden studs as opposed to a concrete block garage wall.  Simply nail up some 1x2\" furring strips onto the studs, then use some 3/4\" screws to attach the pegboard to the strips.\n\n$19 for a sheet of pegboard is just too cheap and easy an alternative to use instead.  You end up with:\n\na. More flexible uses: you can quickly move the pegs anywhere as tools change or are added over 32 square feet of storage on just a single sheet\nb. Better use of the wall space: 2x4s waste a ton of wall space by definition if you hang anything other than these full length tools, that's why he only shows them being hung.  So now you can also put all the small but regularly used tools at quick reach, like hammers or even screwdrivers with an inexpensive or even homemade mount for them.\nc. Something that adds resale value to the home instead of looking like it was built by the Beverly Hillbillies.\n\nA single sheet of pegboard would add 5 times the useful storage that this design provides, and for no real effort or time more, and barely much cost difference for a homeowner.",

A great example of this is bike storage. For some people, those hoist systems are perfect. For others hooks are perfect. For me, neither are good or optimal or even an option. I also have 7 bikes to hang in a very small space. But again, for someone else, it could not be more perfect",

    "text": "The rolling tool chests have evolved and work very efficiently, for a few key reasons: 1) the drawers are a good size to visually scan, and depth fits a great majority of standard tools. Liners and some internal organizing is all one needs to learn what goes where without over-organizing and wasting space; 2) more small cabinets can fit on top, and drawers are at or below eye level, a real problem for built-in shelving and cabinets over work areas. 3) Most drawers fully extend, and are very strong even loaded with tools. 4) You can move them nearer, or away, from areas, and unlike tray systems, aren't likely to tip over. The metal construction is rigid, but thinner than any wood drawer systems, which are heavy and usually built semi-permanently, demanding a lot of pre-planning design.\n  If your shop is for miscellaneous repair and DIY work, not woodworking, building out a full storage and wall system is impractical and costly, without all the wood tools needed.",

The Gladiator steel hangers are stronger, hold more weight than French cleats. Plywood cleats tool holders often must be bigger than the tools. You can fit far more tools on a Gladiator GearWall with hook hangers and this system is infinitely adaptable for ANY storage needs. We installed the slatwall on all three garage \u2764",

    "text": "Really balanced presentation!  One thing I would add is that the \"rail\" that I have is a 1x3, painted white, with either dowels, hooks, or nails in it.  That's what I have in my garage, all the long things hang from that.\n\nYou make a good point about being locked into a brand with some systems.  In my opinion, no one should buy into any system that is brand specific, if for no reason other than it will eventually be cancelled.  Use plywood, cabinets, cleats, pegboard, open shelving.  If there aren't many companies making the product, you're both stuck and paying too much.",

    "text": "\"Enjoy\" your video? No. I found it incredibly depressing. If these are my only realistic options, I'll NEVER get my workshop organized. I've already got my tool density almost a full order of magnitude more dense than yours and still can't seem to efficiently organize: a 19\" bandsaw, 2 bench-grinders, a miter saw, a 7\"x21\" lathe with associated rests, chucks, & vices, a combo disc & belt sander, vacuum cleaner, dust collector,  ultrasonic cleaner, 15 gallon air compressor, an assortment of handheld power tools (Sawzall (2), impact driver (2), cordless drill (2), dremel, heat guns (2), angle grinder (2), portable belt sanders (2)), a collection of clamps, bench vice, a drill press, a full set of hand tools (wrenches (SAE & Metric), sockets (SAE & Metric), ratchets, power bars, torque wrenches, screwdrivers, numerous hammers, allen wrenches, saws, various cutting tools, pliers, tin snips, bolt cutters, riveters, staplers, hot glue guns), propane torches, precision measuring tools (calipers, micrometers, runout gauges + support hardware, levels, squares), taps (SAE & Metric), dies (SAE & Metric), punches, chisels, soldering irons, multimeters, along with all the replaceable cutting/sanding (sandpaper, steel wool, blades, cutting wheels, grinding discs, bandsaw blades, sanding belts & discs, drill bits, razor blades, lathe cutting tools, mill ends, vacuum filters, etc.) consumables. PLUS various raw materials (wood, metal, plastic, wire, rope, screen, nuts, bolts, nails, specialty fasteners, rivets, staples) used to create things. Also, all the lubricants, glues, solvents, & cleaning solutions to support projects. My workspace is 10' by 20'. Two ends can't be used because one is a garage door, & the other is a walkway. Oh, I forgot airless painter, paint, drywall related patch stuff. I'm not including my numerous shovels, picks, pruners, leaf blowers, edgers, hedge trimmers, chainsaws, machetes, rakes, brooms, string trimmers, loppers, sledge hammers, etc., which I have organized into a 1.5'x1.5'x8' space. None of those systems you showed seemingly could accommodate my collection of tools & materials, leaving me depressed. Your demonstration of a broom & shovel wall hanging solution made me laugh. I have over 5X the number of tools in that category you showed I've got it packed into that 1.5'x1.5' space I mentioned. I want to get everything neatly organized. I fix stuff, & I make stuff. I also do my own gardening. I tend to work more with metal than wood, but I have the tools for both. Oh, I also forgot what I call my specialty tools: borescope, lasers, label printers, magnifying glasses, temperature measurement tools, and on and on. Oh, I also have a portapower with dies. When I was a little kid my father told me \"A man has to be able to fix anything.\" I took that to heart. He might have just been joking. Dunno. I was just a kid. I sure as heck can fix way more than he ever could.",

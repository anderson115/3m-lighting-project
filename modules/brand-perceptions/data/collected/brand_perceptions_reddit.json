    "text": "3M Command large 5lb Hooks fell along with Ikea curtain and rod, made me jump from sleep\n\nHi! I have a really dumb situation and desperately need your help. So I got the large (2 hooks) Command Hooks from from [https://www.amazon.ca/Command-FC13-BN-EF-Brushed-Nickel-Strips/dp/B000M3THK4/](https://www.amazon.ca/Command-FC13-BN-EF-Brushed-Nickel-Strips/dp/B000M3THK4/) as each holds 5lb, I cleaned the wall with alcohol wipes, waited until dry, then hanged [https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/hilleborg-blackout-curtains-1-pair-gray-40425030/](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/hilleborg-blackout-curtains-1-pair-gray-40425030/) \\[curtain\\] onto [https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/raecka-curtain-rod-black-70217157/](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/raecka-curtain-rod-black-70217157/) \\[curtain rod\\]. The setup is perfect except the angle of the hook; since the gap between the top of the window and the ceiling is just around 9cm [https://imgur.com/oPXVEye](https://imgur.com/oPXVEye), I had to rotate the hooks instead of the \"normal angle\" [https://imgur.com/7t46b3C](https://imgur.com/7t46b3C). Note that I actually loosen and re-tigthen the screw for the \"hook part\" of the curtain hook to change it to a perpendicular angle [https://imgur.com/sxLaWaw](https://imgur.com/sxLaWaw); the setup was up for 5 days then this morning it fell; making me jump from sleep into reality.\n\nThis specific hook is already the strongest and most affordable non-damaging hook I know, and at the old place I used this **with the correct angle**, it never fell with the same curtain and curtain rod. Since I do not own this unit, hooks that require drilling is not an option. This specific blackout curtain is also the most affordable one that actually works, and the rod is specifically designed for heavy curtains. Fortunately only some wall paint fell and there's no serious damage, but this truly gave me trauma.\n\nI have 2 more of these and lots of strips, should I try again with more hooks? What do you suggest? Otherwise I will burn to ashes next morning as the sunlight and glare is insane in this unit. Thanks!",

    "text": "Can you use super glue on command hooks?\n\nI'm in an apartment and I like using command hooks because normally they hang things stress free, but for some reason some of the hooks I've had for MONTHS just randomly came off of the wall. They're not even holding anything heavy, and like I said I'd been using them for months with no issue until recently. The sticky part is still on the wall, so I was considering reattaching the hooks to the adhesive with a bit of super glue to bind it more strongly. I figure it might work okay since I would put it on the adhesive strip and not on the wall, but I wanted to ask someone with more wisdom about this if this would be a feasible solution or if the adhesive needs to remain as is on both sides in order to cleanly remove it from the wall. If someone has insight into this, it would be greatly appreciated!",

I have done that more than once.   \nI don't know if these fixes were recommended to you, but here's mine for getting these hooks to stick better. First, ignore anybody who says \"don't use cleaner on surface\". Use a good degreasing cleaner like 409 and clean up that surface. Rubbing alcohol is good, but it won't fully remove some of the gunk that can be on the door. Once you're done with the cleaner, use the rubbing alcohol and let the surface dry. There should be little to no grease/oil on the surface after that. \n\nAnother thing that helps - use a hair dryer on the surface until its nice and warm (not too hot). Then, when you apply it, push on it nice and good for that minute, then let it sit not for just one hour, but overnight with no weight on it.   \nI managed to get a couple of these to stick nice and strong on textured satin-finished walls in an RV shower this way, and they've been surprisingly solid. Good luck!",

If this is a door with coats of oil paint on it, you may be seeing an adhesion problem not only due to surface contaminants, but with greasy compounds that may be 'blooming' through the coats of paint. Alcohol actually can make the issue worse, by solubilizing these greasy contaminants more, causing a 're-bloom'. Surface chemistry can be very interesting sometimes!",

    "text": "3M Command Hooks keep falling down &amp; rubbing alcohol melts the wall paint... Advice?\n\nI'm hoping someone can shed a little light on what is going on here. I have used 3M Command Hooks successfully at my parent's house. They have been able to hold up more weight than they are even designated to without ever falling down (1 Lbs hook for a 4 Lb coat). However, at the dorms, even when using the heaviest duty hooks (10 Lbs. capacity hook for a single towel), they fall right down. I follow the same protocol as at my parents house - I hold/press the adhesive and I wait at least 24 hours before hanging anything up. I believe this has something to do with the paint on the walls. The adhesive for the hooks also rips off the paint. I've read that you should clean the walls (I've used soap and water before, it doesn't seem to do anything) but rubbing alcohol just melts the paint away. I put a little bit on a towel and then rub it in, and then my towel has white paint smeared on it... How can I get the 3M hooks to stay attached to these walls, or is there any other option? I use these hooks for so many different things, but they just keep falling down on a weekly basis. I cannot punch holes into the walls. Thank you.",

If you do end up putting fixings into any walls, try to keep them as minimal and discreet as possible so as not to get nabbed by any room inspectors.... and a little dab of polyfilla ('spackle') or similar filler in the holes, maybe with a dab of beige paint (or whatever matching colour) from a tester pot, just before moving out time, could keep you out of trouble....

Significantly more work than foam boards, but it would do a better job and the garage would look normal other than an oddly sunken door.\n\nThe exterior side is probably easier putting something on the inside, depending on what the exterior looks like.\n\nAlso, check the weather stripping on the doors.",

You could test this by attaching/sealing a small piece of the material to the wall for a couple of weeks with duct tape and check it periodically for dampness.\n\nAlso, adding insulation will not warm the space directly, just help keep heat from escaping. Without some additional source of heat down there, it may not do much. You said you have no \u201cdirect heat\u201d. I assume you mean to this area.  I would suggest getting a qualified hvac person in to check it out (assuming you haven\u2019t already).  If there is a way to add a small duct to the existing system, that might be the ticket (do you know where all your ducts go? There could even be one in that ceiling already).\n\nIf you have more money (and room), you could also create a small vestibule inside (or outside) to keep the heat in better by having a second door (like a space dock or a canal lock - one door is always closed).",

    "text": "3M Command Strip Failures\n\nHi all, I could use some help troubleshooting some recent failures of 3M Command strips. I've used them for years without a single problem but have now had two failures in the past week. I'll explain:  \n  \n* A small hook adhered to the wall with a small 3M strip holding a potholder fell. The 3M strip remained attached to the wall.  \n  \n* A 2lb wooden key holder adhered to the wall with two large strips (per packaging each able to hold 5lbs) fell. The strips remained attached to the wall.  \n  \nMy troubleshooting research has been unhelpful thus far. I cleaned the walls with rubbing alcohol before application. The walls are not textured and don't have wallpaper. I held pressure on the strips for 30sec-1min and allowed 1-2 hours before \"load bearing\" as per package instructions. It has not been very warm in either room, I would say consistently in the 70sF. The strips were different sizes and purchased at different times, so I don't think it was a manufacturing problem. What am I missing? Thanks in advance!",

When you apply the strips, wait at least half an hour before installing and at least a day before loading for best performance. This gives the adhesive time to bond to both surfaces.",

I used to buy big packs on purpose so I had extra when I needed and bc it\u2019s a better price. \nBut I *think* what happens is once the packaging is opened, even though you leave the protective film on them, they dry out. They\u2019re never actually dry so it took me a while to realize it but command strips work when it\u2019s a new package and when that same package is open and sat around for a year (my experience) they just don\u2019t hold. \n\nI have found no evidence on the internet that this is true but it seems to be the case. \n\nFwiw I live in a fairly dry climate. Not often humid but not desert dry. And my house is temp controlled to 67-75 all year. \n\nI hope this helps!",

    "text": "Trying to install some wall hooks, but what kind of wall do I have?\n\nSo I am a complete DIY newbie and apart from changing lightbulbs and using some spakfilla this is my first time doing anything like this.\n\nBasically I'm trying to hang up some artwork around my apartment. It's a pretty new place in a small three-storey building, constructed around 2008 and importantly for context this is in Australia. I imagine construction isn't *massively* different here than it is in the US but it might be worth mentioning.\n\nSo I grabbed some of [these](https://www.bunnings.com.au/ramset-mini-nylon-wallmate-plasterboard-anchor-with-screw-and-hook-4-pack_p2260965) and tried installing them. The first step on the packet is to push the white nylon anchor in and then use a screwdriver to get it flush with the wall. Unfortunately it only got about 10mm (0.4\") in before it would just go no further. \n\nAnd [this](https://imgur.com/a/xozQz) is the aftermath of it. Apologies for the terrible photos; phone cameras were not meant for this sort of thing...\n\nSo, what the heck kind of walls do I have? My first thought was masonry since:\n\n* the end of the hole is a sort of a grey colour\n* an electronic stud finder seems to randomly find and not find studs depending on how fast I'm moving it and which way the planets are aligned\n* trying to find studs using the \"knocking\" technique seems to show studs which don't go all the way up the wall\n* the garages on the bottom floor have besser-brick walls\n* sound dampening between units is better than I expected\n* I've only tried this on walls shared with other units and with the external walls\n\nIs my reasoning sound? And if so what are my options for wall hooks in that case? I don't trust Command hooks because I've heard too many stories about them falling down in the middle of the night. I would prefer something less destructive since I told my landlord I'd plaster/paint over anything at the end of my lease, but I'm up for anything else.\n\nThanks for reading!",

    "text": "Just be aware that the rigid foam may not breathe enough to avoid collecting moisture between the foam and the wall which could lead to mold. You could test this by attaching/sealing a small piece of the material to the wall for a couple of weeks with duct tape and check it periodically for dampness.\n\nAlso, adding insulation will not warm the space directly, just help keep heat from escaping. Without some additional source of heat down there, it may not do much. You said you have no \u201cdirect heat\u201d. I assume you mean to this area.  I would suggest getting a qualified hvac person in to check it out (assuming you haven\u2019t already).  If there is a way to add a small duct to the existing system, that might be the ticket (do you know where all your ducts go? There could even be one in that ceiling already).\n\nIf you have more money (and room), you could also create a small vestibule inside (or outside) to keep the heat in better by having a second door (like a space dock or a canal lock - one door is always closed).",

    "text": "If the building was built around 2008 then you almost certainly have gypsum board drywall cladding. Good idea avoiding Command Hooks. The anchors you bought will work just fine if you drill the appropriate sized pilot hole. A common size for pilot in metric countries is 6 mm but I've had better luck with roughly 5 mm. I say roughly because I'm in the land before metric. Check the packaging of the anchors you bought, it might have the recommended size of pilot drill. If it doesn't, use a ruler or calipers to check the minor diameter of the threaded portion on the anchor (that's the smallest point in the cross section of the thread) and drill slightly larger than that.\n\nAs for less destructive, look into Ook Brand picture hooks. They use 1, 2, or 3 small pin nails driven through a \"specially\" designed hook and they work well in drywall, but they can't support extremely heavy frames.\n\nHope this helps.",

I\u2019ve used 3-in-one lubricant to lube the hinges, pins, rollers (not the actual wheel or the track), and spring. I\u2019ve lubricated everything at least three times except for the rails and chain yet it still makes a loud squealing sound when the door is being lowered. Should I try lubricating the top of the railing where the carrier slides along?",

    "text": "Ok im going to give you a series of things to look at. This may require a second pair of eyes as well as a hand remote. \n\n1. First things first, when it comes to garage doors, use nothing but silicone lubricant. Using anything else only gums up moving parts by attracting dirt.\n\n2. When the door is coming down, inspect rollers to see if they are rolling properly. This is where a second pair of eyes comes in.  Can do both sides at once.\n\nAlso check the rollers for any signs of odd wear, like flattening on one side of the rollers. \n\n3. Many people don't realize this, but lubricating the weatherstripping on the inside while the door is up, eliminates some noise as the rubber on weatherstripping can get compromised by extreme weather patterns. Too cold, rubber gets stiff. Too hot, rubber gets melty and sticks to the door.\n\n4, Have your spring tension checked. Garage doors are lots of moving parts, and springs are the worst part about it. I always recommend having the garage door at least inspected once a year. Alot can happen in between each inspection, and its better to be safe than sorry. Reputable companies will sometimes offer a decent price for just an inspection, or sometimes will do it for free or close to it. \n\nHope this helps.",

I  intended to take down the partition wall, separating the two sides of this garage and converting it to workshop. \n\nI am loking for recommendations on wall/waterproofing/insulation and siding assemblies for the interior.\n\nThis garage is associated with a duplex that I bought, one side of garage for each tenant, one unit is vacant and in three months time the other tenants lease is up and I will be able to commandeer the whole thing\n\nI still want to semi-finish the right side now so I can have a cleaner space to set up a temporary shop for the next three months ntil I can do evrything once the other tenant vacates. \n\nlike is there a concrete sealer that I can coat on the inside of my half of this garage just to help prevent sweating for now? Or will this present an issue in the future when I\u2019m ready to pull the trigger on prepping all of the block walls once I get the whole thing. If I pull a permit for underlayment and siding at a later time, will I be trapping moisture in? \n\nI\u2019d do the siding now, before moving into my half so it\u2019s all sealed up first but my jurisdiction is VERY strict about having permits for work and will be nosing around the second waterproofing or siding goes up outside, and finished-detached garages are no longer permitted in my jurisdiction. So I really want to have the interior alteration completed so that if for whatever reason the inspector comes out for the siding and sees the interior, he will assume it was existing, and it won\u2019t be an issue for me to try to build as I have future work on this property to complete and don\u2019t want him to one day see an u finished garage and then all of a sudden a finished garage.\n\nAnyway, is siding or stucco my only option for the outside?Are there assemblies that I can waterproof insulate and finish from the inside and permanent leave the exterior block exposed? \n\nThanks",

I think I will use an aluminum rail with hooks like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Park-Tool-Machine-Thread-Storage/dp/B001P9KP8W/) so can slide the hooks left to right when needed. Bikes weigh about 40-50 lbs each. \n\nThought it would be easy, just look for ceiling joists and attach but I'm confused about the layout in my garage. I have ceiling joists going parallel to the garage doors and perpendicular. See photo: https://imgur.com/a/nvFYbzN Thought they would only go in one direction and not be intersecting. Maybe because there was a bonus room built above the garage?\n\nHow do I know which ones are load bearing and which ones are not? Does it matter for two bikes?\n\nThanks",

    "text": "Can I hook my garage heater up to this plug/panel?\n\nMy gf bought me a garage heater for Christmas. I've done some minor electrical work around the house (added a breaker and installed 6 recessed lights in my living room) but don't have the knowledge to hook this up. Just wondering if it's possible to wire up the heater to plug into the outlet or if the panel could be somewhat easily outfitted to power the heater. Pics: heater power diagram, main house panel, garage panel, outlet. TIA.",

    "text": "3M Command large 5lb Hooks fell along with Ikea curtain and rod, made me jump from sleep\n\nHi! I have a really dumb situation and desperately need your help. So I got the large (2 hooks) Command Hooks from from [https://www.amazon.ca/Command-FC13-BN-EF-Brushed-Nickel-Strips/dp/B000M3THK4/](https://www.amazon.ca/Command-FC13-BN-EF-Brushed-Nickel-Strips/dp/B000M3THK4/) as each holds 5lb, I cleaned the wall with alcohol wipes, waited until dry, then hanged [https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/hilleborg-blackout-curtains-1-pair-gray-40425030/](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/hilleborg-blackout-curtains-1-pair-gray-40425030/) \\[curtain\\] onto [https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/raecka-curtain-rod-black-70217157/](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/raecka-curtain-rod-black-70217157/) \\[curtain rod\\]. The setup is perfect except the angle of the hook; since the gap between the top of the window and the ceiling is just around 9cm [https://imgur.com/oPXVEye](https://imgur.com/oPXVEye), I had to rotate the hooks instead of the \"normal angle\" [https://imgur.com/7t46b3C](https://imgur.com/7t46b3C). Note that I actually loosen and re-tigthen the screw for the \"hook part\" of the curtain hook to change it to a perpendicular angle [https://imgur.com/sxLaWaw](https://imgur.com/sxLaWaw); the setup was up for 5 days then this morning it fell; making me jump from sleep into reality.\n\nThis specific hook is already the strongest and most affordable non-damaging hook I know, and at the old place I used this **with the correct angle**, it never fell with the same curtain and curtain rod. Since I do not own this unit, hooks that require drilling is not an option. This specific blackout curtain is also the most affordable one that actually works, and the rod is specifically designed for heavy curtains. Fortunately only some wall paint fell and there's no serious damage, but this truly gave me trauma.\n\nI have 2 more of these and lots of strips, should I try again with more hooks? What do you suggest? Otherwise I will burn to ashes next morning as the sunlight and glare is insane in this unit. Thanks!",

I figured this was a fluke and removed two more hooks and those also tore off the paint.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've installed them properly and followed the instructions for removal (pull down slooooooowly, and never towards you) so I'm not sure why this is happening. Could it be because whoever painted never used primer?

I bought some heavy duty bike hooks for a project in my garage and I've been trying to use a stud finder to find a joist in the ceiling. I got some readings from the stud finder and proceeded to screw the bike hooks in, but the hooks just became really loose near the end so I pulled them out. I shined a flash light in the hole and it seems that the drywall in the ceiling is almost 3 layers deep, and not a joist in sight. Could the thickness of the drywall be throwing off my stud finder? What would you guys recommend to finish this project? Thank you!",

The metal plates will be sort of flat and so won\u2019t push the rack out from the wall as much. \n\nFigure out the positioning of them using the little dips that are there for screws. Attach one side first and let the adhesive set without the rack in place; then attach the second side. You\u2019ll probably have to let the adhesive set with the rack in position, unless you figure out whether you can flex the rack enough to come out and back in without permanent distortion. \n\n(Did that make any sense?)\n\nBarring that, you could screw the rack to a piece of wood, and then use Command strips to attach the wood to the cabinet using a Command hook on the cabinet and a sawtooth picture hanger on the back of the wood. .\n\nIf you know someone handy who\u2019s got a router, you could have the route out whatever space necessary to make the wood hang completely flat. \n\nOr you could make sure the back of the wood is moth (paint it), and then use Command strips to attach it directly to the wood itself (the tabs will need to stick out to the sides so you can pull them, so they\u2019ll be visible; you could try to cover them by setting a frame around the wood. , but that\u2019s getting elaborate)",

    "text": "Former pro painter here. We pull it dry. We don't have time to go back and mess with wet paint lines, seriously. You keep working and come back to get it later in the day. \n\n The thing is, there is a right and wrong way to pull tape. Believe it or not. Firstly, don't load up the line edge with lots of paint as some here are correctly pointing out. We call that dry brushing, as we have the minimum amount of paint on the brush at the tape line. Like 1/4 of what we would have on the brush elsewhere. In fact we never take a lot of paint into any corner, because then you spend all day pulling it back out. We start away from the line and curve into the line, only taking what is comfortable. With a good brush this is plenty. \n\n When pulling tape. and anybody can learn this in minutes, always pull at an acute angle. That's the method. So if I'm pulling tape from a baseboard I always keep myself 3 feet in front of the pull line and pull it evenly over itself, like a hairpin angle. Never behind it or even. Because it pulls the paint up with it. When it's coming off \"doubled over\" all the pressure at the point of separation is on the tape. Not the paint on the surface. If that makes sense. Like a lot of that job, it's all about angle. Don't get lazy and keep moving your feet to stay in front of it. You are in control of how fast you pull after all. \n\n This method has a 99% success rate and no other method is as good. We usually had to fix a little patch of a few inches between every 2 or 3 rooms. That's acceptable and a good day. Never had to score any either, although we use a putty knife to get up some stubborn tape once in a while. Which you can do with out causing damage. \n\n\n\nI tell weekend warriors all the time to tape it up tight and use this method for clean lines. Just don't leave it overnight. That's the quick way into a problem. \"Pulling tape\" was the best part of the day. It's at the end and all your hard work starts to look beautiful. And it's almost beer time. \n\nPulling tape is fun.",

    "text": "Thoughts on this diy heater exhaust vent fix?\n\nThe first two pics are what it looked like before my father and I took on this project. This is my first house and it seems like I bought the \"landlord special\" house. This exhaust vent would cause trouble in the winter by not venting properly. thus causing condensation to build up in the attic and drip through the ceiling into my bedroom. This would only happen if the heater was being used constantly throughout the day, so thankfully it didn't happen too often, but it definitely needed to be fixed. We chipped away at it and what the previous owner did was use some sort of paneling that seemed to be basically cardboard, cut a hole in it and attached the exhaust tube to it via scotch packaging tape. Then attached it all to the wall with a ton of spray foam. The last two photos is what we had done. It seemed like a big improvement already when we were halfway through and air was only coming through the hole that we cut in the sheet metal.",

I tested the tape in a spot that we hadn't sanded or cleaned, and it didn't pull any paint up. I'm worried that the shitty middle layer will ruin the adhesion of our new paint. Is this an issue?

    "text": "How do I get this glue off of my wall?\n\n\nThe owner of my house before me has now made himself infamous for his terrible DIY projects. Among some pretty obvious issues is installing a channel drain that funnels water TO the lowest part of the yard, shoving the ground wires for outlets and switches into the back of the box, wood gluing interlocking laminate floor pieces together so you cannot get them up or put them back if you tear them apart, and using a hot glue gun instead of plumbers putty on a sink drain.\n\nThis week I tore off the wallpaper on one wall of my bedroom because there was only wallpaper on one wall and it was a really tacky blue shiplap. Underneath it was double-sided scotch tape, and this god-awful I don't know what.\n\nAt first I thought it was going to be some simple glue to get off. It kind of has the consistency of rubber while still being slightly sticky. If you're dedicated and have a little bit of time and gentle touch you can kind of roll it off the wall with your fingers, but not with any efficiency.\n\nI tried scraping it off with a scraper, but it just ended up bouncing off it while scraping the paint around it. I tried sanding it with sandpaper, and it completely ignored it. I tried using nail polish remover and it did not care one bit. I tried using a rotary sander, and that worked a little, but not without sanding everything else more.\n\nI then used a dremel to try and dremel it off, but the force that I had to use meant that as soon as it was gone I immediately dug a quarter inch into the drywall. I used a dremel cutting blade to cut under it which worked, but it didn't work on the glue but on the drywall behind it like a filet knife that left gashes.\n\nI tried a blow dryer, soapy water, a clothes iron, and I even tried PURE ACETONE on a rag with a scraper and wash cloth. That worked more than anything else but took literally everything else with it and was very time intensive.\n\nWTF is this and how can I get it off to paint the wall?",

We've visited the local box stores and priced things such as paint and several other items but I've been wondering if I could find some items cheaper online or if reddit might have some better ideas for certain items.\n\nThe main things on my list right now are:\n\n1. **Painters Tape** We've priced this around and found that it generally goes for 7 or 8 dollars a roll.  When we painted our apartment  we just used plain scotch tape and it kind of turned into a disaster so I think this time around we're going splash the cash and buy actual painters tape.  Is there anywhere online I can find painting supplies at a decent price?\n\n1. **Countertops** Again we've priced these at the box stores but haven't found anything we love.  We're building a 3x5 island for the kitchen using stock cabinetry so we don't need a huge slab.  Lowe's had some marble we liked but their minimum quantity is 25sq ft.  Does anyone know where the best place to look would be?\n\n1.  **Edison Bulbs** Amazon?\n\n1. **Window coverings** I'm thinking IKEA for blinds..but if anyone has better ideas I wouldn't mind finding them somewhere closer(the nearest IKEA is a 3 hour trip).\n\nAny other general \"best place to get _____\" would be greatly appreciated.

    "text": "Bug screens on windows... is there a magical way to seal them?!\n\nHi,\n\nWe don't have air conditioning so leave a bunch of our windows cracked open to varying degrees. All of our windows have the bug screens that kind of sit in front of the window - however they're not exactly air tight to the frame and things always seem to get through.\n\nI've resorted to using masking tape to tape down the edges which works, and I see a bunch of small insects get stuck to the tape. It obviously looks pretty unsightly though having white masking tape around the screens. \n\nDo I just have cheap screens (or perhaps windows that are not square to the frame) or is this just a normal occurrence?",

    "text": "Playroom with built in playset for my sanity I mean kids\n\nTL/DR: I took a huge storage room and transformed it into a playroom with a built-in playset for my ~~sanity~~ kids.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Pictures from start to finish](https://imgur.com/a/aaiBCVP)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith the kids home most of the day (thank goodness for in-person preschool), my wife an I were being driven crazy by the kids in the main living room. They were pent-up rambunctious loud normal kids who left their toys everywhere (5 years old, 3 years old, 18 months). So my wife and I decided to reduce our clutter by getting rid of some things and moving others from our huge storage room into a playroom. Unfortunately, my wife went to Pinterest for some ideas. Thus an empty room with their toys became a project.\n\n\nFirst I measured and made a couple of different models of playset to put in the room. the one in the pictures is the one we settled on. I used Microsoft's 3D builder program. As I didn't need anything too fancy or that cost money.\n\n\nThen we started emptying the storage room, some was sold online, some was given to charities, some was taken to the dump, and we kept a few things.\n\nWe took some time deciding what to do with the walls. Since I had never mudded or taped we were not confident in my abilities. We also wanted something stronger than drywall because well kids. After discussing manget boards or other options we decided on bead board as I had done that before. Unfortunately, this time was vastly different and not in a good way.\n\nThen it was on to mudding and tapping which I had never done before. It turned out better than I expected. Some of my seams were very well done. Others needed some help. It didn't matter if it was the first, middle, or last any of them could have been good or bad.\n\nAt this point I was waiting for some supplies to come in (mostly wood). So decided to go on to paint. Boss lady decided that we needed to use sky blue. Since most of the paint was going to be on the ceiling I choose Matte paint. I also knew that it would hide my imperfections better. Since the bead board was going 8 feet tall on all walls but one I didn't have to worry about durability. I used my brothers paint sprayer the original primer I used worked great. Then I switched to a slightly different primer but it was thicker and cause some minor issues until I thinned it out. I never want to do primer without a sprayer again it was so much easier. However, they say to roll on color. I also wanted a little texture to help hide the imperfections. So I rolled the blue on.\n\nAfter the paint dried and I was able to get my supplies it was time to get down to the real building. I started with putting in the baseboards making sure they were level. Note if I was to use these kinds of baseboards again I would put the bead board up first. The issue was when I went to put the bead board up it was not perfectly square so I had issues getting it to stay butted agains the board next to it and the baseboard.\n\nThis was the time when my worst failure of this project happened. I used Liquid Nails with a couple of brad nails from my pneumatic nail gun to put the bead board up. Liquid Nails is what I used last time I did bead board but that wasn't 8 feet tall and more importantly I have since learned that Liquid Nails changed the formula to be VOC compliant. This resulted in 1/3 the holding strength it had before. Finally to top it all off I didn't check the length of the brad nails and they were only 1 inch long so they didn't go far enough to hid studs. Needless to say the whole thing came crashing down. My solution that only partially worked was to use 2 tubes of Liquid Nails a ton of brad nails all over and use a board and chair to hold it up for about an hour. This is when I did my research on Liquid Nails. The next morning when I got up one side of the panel was looking great the other side had a wave in it and I couldn't fix it. Oh well, have to move on or this will never get done.\n\nAfter that I took all the tubes of Liquid Nails back and got Loctite instead. It worked a lot better still had to hold it for several minutes to let it start to cure but better than an hour. My brother-in-law and father-in-law came to help. We finished the bead board and the chair rail. Then we started working on the framing for the playset. I had already put the leger board up before the bead board so we worked on hanging the vertical supports from the ceiling anchor which I had already hung. This is where I got to start using my very overkill, for this project, brackets. Hey if your going to build it for kids might as well over build it.\n\nThe framing was the most enjoyable part of this entire project in fact it went so smoothly that my father-in-law and I both kept double checking things because it was going too easily. However after drilling holes with the hammer drill and setting the brackets for the posts we hung the joists and every turned out square. Unlike the rest of the room.\n\nWe then installed the platforms using the plywood I already had. It was a pain to get straight cuts out of the circular saw. I saw guide bent near the beginning so we had chalk lines and free handed it. In retrospect we should have just taken the time to pack up my father-in-law's table saw and bring it over. Rip cuts are a 100% easier on a table saw.\n\nI was back on my own to put together the shelves, ladder, and slide. I didnt put the slide together at this point as I wanted to use my electric sander as I was planning on several coats for the slide. So on to sanding everything. I went though a lot of sandpaper. I got the platform, ladder, shelves, and slide super smooth with 320 grit. everything else stopped at 220.\n\nBack to painting. So I put up painter's plastic with painter's tape to protect the few things in the room I didnt want to be white. Out came the paint sprayer, but this time I ran out of primer and the store didn't have the one I originally used. When I asked they said they had some in quart sized. So I got that and left, thinking that the different color was due to the different size. Oh, how wrong I was. The primer I was originally using and the second primer I used were both water based as I was planning on using latex paint. This primer was oil based. It was not low fumes, I got a little tippsy and had a headache for the next couple of days. I had to rough up that primer with sandpaper so I could apply water based primer. What a waste of several days.\n\nFinally on to the white paint. I thought about rolling it like I did the blue but all the corners and nooks and cranies were just to much for me so I sprayed the paint on as well. I did two coats of primer, two coats of paint. Then for the platform, shelves, ladder and slide I added two coats of Minwax polycrylic water based protective finish. Sanding in between for a very smooth surface. Mostly to make the most touched areas last longer but also to make the slide really fast.\n\nI could see the light at the end of the tunnel. I started putting in the flooring. I had to cut around the posts and the sides but it turned out great and I'm glad most of the room is white or those colors would have been very busy looking. I also got my custom made nets in. I used a ridiculous amount of staples to attach it to the frame. See previous comment about over engineering things.\n\nThen I moved in the Lovesac and some toys. I had still not put the slide together becuase I started but stupidly used the same 1 1/2 screws I used for the brackets on the frame. Works great with 2x6s not so great with 3/4 thick plywood. I had to repair, sand, repaint, and refinish that part of the slide.\n\nLuckily it only took a day. I then installed the slide using the variable angle brackets, but the wall next to the slide is not square with the wall behind the playset that the platform is square with. The slide ended up being slightly crooked with the bottom moved over toward the ladder side. This left a gap at the connection of the slide and platform. I have not figure out how to fix that yet. If anyone has any ideas please let me know.\n\nAt some point the TV went up, the chairs came in and the rest of the toys made it on the shelves.\n\nHaving this separate area for the kids to play and keep all of their toys had made my wife's and my lives infinitly better. I could feel the weight off my shoulders. \n\nIn case you are wondering the one area of the platform that doesn't have a net is for jumping out onto the Lovesac.\n\nLessons learned. \n* Use a table saw not a circular saw for rip cuts and crosscuts to big for the miter saw.\n* Put the bead board up first then put the molding over it. \n* Double check what base the paint or primer you are use is. Make sure they all match. Oil with Oil, Water with Water.\n* Never use Liquid Nails again. Since they changed the fomula to be VOC compliant it has 1/3 the holding power it used to.\n\nMaterial List:\n* Plywood: was already here but something like [THIS](https://www.lowes.com/pd/3-4-in-Common-Fir-Sanded-Plywood-Application-as-2-x-4/1000068963)\n* Corner Trim: [HERE](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Simpson-Strong-Tie-Strong-Drive-174-SD-CONNECTOR-Screw-8212-9-x-1-1-2-in-1-4-Hex-Drive-Mech-Galv-100-Qty/3242494)\n* Long 2x6: Used for the ceiling anchor and front of frame.

With any  non-basic equipment I spend a non-insignificant amount of time trying to think up ways I haven't considered yet that children could interact with the equipment, each other and the environment. And every now and then we're informed of an accident or an injury mechanism we hadn't considered yet. 'Progressive insight' is never very far away in child safety.\n\nAll that as an introduction to: no there aren't, because that shit is fucking complex and cannot be adequately covered in a checklist that leads to an acceptable result when used by noobs (no offense). Yes, you can find some checklists, but they will contain generalised information on how to generally deal with impact, entrapment, shear, cutting, etc. \n\n\nIf you want to do it right I advise the following steps:\n\n- Click [here](https://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail?pid=000000000030396132) and go to page 6 of the preview to get an idea of the relevant topics for safety of play equipment.\n\n- Click [here](https://www.evs.ee/en/evs-en-1176-1-2017) to buy this document for \u20ac28,34 instead of \u00a3298 (LPT for anyone who needs a European Standard: all EU countries + UK sell the same documents &amp; set their own prices, Estonia is the cheapest I know of)\n\n- Open the document and discover 70+ pages of hardcore technicalities that all interact with each other *but you'll have to find out for yourself how they interact*.\n\n- Loose all hope and motivation\n\n- send me a DM and ask me to evaluate your design from drawings / pictures. I'm glad to help, I like making my small contributions to betterment of the world :)\n\n- or, even better: hire a professional to come take a look in person.

    "text": "Best way to adhere a surround \u201ccollar\u201d to a display that can later be removed?\n\n\nThe [photo](https://imgur.com/a/zgQymgj) shows a display embedded in the wall without a border (above), and with one (loosely placed there for the photo, below). \n\nI have a plastic border that I created that will fit around this display to hide the rough edges of the hole.  But since it\u2019s not a naturally tight fit, this collar needs to be adhered in some way to keep it in place.  \n\nI\u2019m thinking of using painters tape on the wall first, then apply black silicone around it; then seat the border against it and clean up the excess to create a neat looking finished unit with no unsightly gaps. Then I can remove the painter\u2019s tape so there\u2019s a sharp edge to any silicone excess around the sides. \n\nHowever at some point I will want to remove the display (from the rear), so I don\u2019t want the sealant adhering to it.  The collar should still be adhered to the wall though.  How do I do this?\n\nI\u2019ve thought perhaps use painter\u2019s tape around the display before adding the sealant, but that just creates a new problem of trimming the tape so that it\u2019s not noticeable, and, later, trying to remove the display from the tape. Perhaps use everyday Scotch tape instead?  Sticky side out?  Smear Vaseline or something on the display edges so that the silicone doesn\u2019t stick to it?  \n\nAny suggestions or ideas on how best to adhere things?  Or perhaps a completely different approach to creating a finished look to the top half of the photo, keeping in mind the need to be able to remove the display from the rear layer on?",

    "text": "Making Sense Out Of Chaos -- A detailed guide to organizing the boxes of miscellaneous items left over after cleaning out a loved-one's final residence.\n\nMy Gran was moved to a memory care facility last year. She lived with us since 2014. When we cleaned out her MIL Suite attached to our house, we were left with containers upon containers of shit just thrown together that we didn't have the brainpower to organize at that time. \"I'll get to that later\". Well, those boxes are taking up 40 sq ft of space in your basement, and \"Later\" is looking a lot more like \"Soon\". \n\nIt's silly to jump into it without a plan. So I made you a plan. I developed your method. You have one less thing to think about now in this emotionally taxing project. Get your coffee, and read through this guide. You're going to freakin' CONQUER this. Let's make sense out of that chaos.\n\nHere we go!\n\n**Determining the Scope** \n\nTake a gander at your stack of bins and boxes. Take out each bin and rustle through it. Focus on identifying WHAT you\u2019re going to be working with.\n\nExample: For my Gran, we had notes, paperwork, photographs, household items, \u201cmemories\u201d (more on that later), and more fucking paperwork.\n\n**Number Your Containers**\n\nThis will save your ass later and help keep you organized. Number EACH box and tub. Physically. Write on those things with a thick ass sharpie \u201cTub\u201d or \u201cBox\u201d and then a number. It doesn\u2019t matter where the box came from. It doesn\u2019t matter what order they\u2019re in. Just as long as you establish inventory, you\u2019ll be grand.\n\nExample: I have Tub #1\u2014Tub #5 and Box #1\u2014Box #6\n\n**Isolate One Box &amp; Make Room**\n\nTake out a container from the collection. Place it in a comfortable spot where you have room to move around. You may be getting up and moving from place to place, so make sure your room is clean and clear of obstacles. A clean room is a must. Put ALL the other containers in a separate area away from your organization room. Trust me. If you look at it, it will only intimidate you. \n\n**Establishing Categories**\n\nYou know the term \u201cWhen organizing, never touch anything twice\u201d? That\u2019s bullshit in this kind of project. We are taking this rollercoaster in steps. The purpose of, what I call \u201cRound 1\u201d, is to separate trash from the important stuff, and put \u2018like with like\u2019. \n\nYou\u2019re going to make an area, preferably with another big empty container, for each category. Here are the categories that WILL MOSTLY encompass everything you\u2019re bound to find in the hoard of miscellaneous small belongings thrown together at the end of a clear out.\n\nMemories\n\nPhotographs\n\nPaperwork\n\nPaper Memories\n\n\u201cI have no idea\u201d\n\nTrash\n\nLet me go over each category.\n\n\"Photographs\". Every photograph you can imagine. Even the printed ones. Not the ones in frames. If you want to be really progressive, keep the polaroids SEPERATE from anything else. The two types of chemicals used in the processing of the types of film degrades both of them. Portraits, cat pictures, garden pictures, the literal only picture of your great grandfather. All of them.\n\n\"Memories\". These are objects, artwork, books, etc. Anything a person keeps for any reason until they leave the earth. Or your house. A lot of them are only sentimental to the individual and don\u2019t mean much to you. Don\u2019t evaluate this concept yet. Focus, remember your categories. Move along.\n\n\"Paperwork\". This is the serious shit. Your boxes will. WILL. have paperwork that you do not know if you should keep or not. Place every 'document' that is professional correspondence, medical records, housing inspections, homeowners insurance, receipts, etc, into one designated \"Paperwork\" box. Don't stress yourself out wondering what it actually is and if you actually need to keep it just yet. Just determine if it's administrative paperwork or \"paperwork memories\" and sort it first.\n\n\"Paperwork Memories\". This can sometimes be easy to determine, and sometimes it can be difficult. Because in my Gran's final year or so living with us, she clipped everything out of the newspaper from articles on bird care (she has no bird) to saving full page advertisements. There was also a lot... and I mean A LOT of notes that she wrote down from day to day that don't make a lick of sense. A grocery list. The word \"hair\". Someone's phone number. The name \"Nick\". The name \"Lenore\". Notes from my mother who was her primary caretaker. Notes that say \"I'm going to the store. I will be back by 2pm. I love you.\". If in doubt, keep it. And go through it later. But these are still paper memories and go in the \"paper memories\" box. This ALSO INCLUDES stuff that is obviously important and needs to be stored like College Diplomas, yearbook pages, letters from loved ones, cards, etc.\n\n\"I have no idea\". You will come across some shit that's just... weird. Like you really won't have a single idea what to do with it. Make a box for your confusion and come back to it way later.\n\n\u201cTrash\u201d is anything you determine to be trash. If you don't need it, and it doesn't tell a story or represent your mother, let it go. You might not want the scribblings of your parent in their decline of mental capability. You may want to hold onto those pieces a little bit longer. That is absolutely okay.\n\n**Things You Will Need For Sanity**\n\nYou\u2019re almost ready to go through your first container! You will need a couple of things to keep yourself organized.\n\n1. Post-its (Brand name. They stick MUCH better) \n\n2. A couple of black sharpies. I say a couple because you will misplace it every single fucking time you put it down and you need to be able to pick up another while the first one is probably sitting under a pile of crap. \n\n3. Buy at least 3 boxes of sandwich baggies (sealable) and 4 boxes of freezer baggies (gallon). \n\n4. A notebook on a clipboard and a hoard of pens. \n\n5. Trash bags. Get the good brand. \n\n6. White Mailing Labels.\n\n7. File Folders\n\n7. Scotch tape\n\n**Opening Pandora\u2019s Box**\n\nOnce you have all of your supplies within arm\u2019s or leg\u2019s reach, your organization room is clear, you have one container, and you\u2019ve had your coffee\u2026 Put on a playlist. Pro Tip: Nothing sappy or sad. One sad tune is enough to keep you tunneled on a certain object for way too long and emotionally exhaust you enough to cut your organization day short.\n\nOpen the box. Take a breath. \n\nWhen you come across any of these things, grab a gallon baggie, slap a blank mailing label on it, and grab a sharpie\n\nPhotographs or Polaroids\n\nAdmin Paperwork\n\nPaper Memories\n\nExample: Baggie labeled \u201cTub #1 \u2013 Photographs\u201d or \u201cTub #1 \u2013 Admin Paperwork\u201d\n\n**The Bulky Important Paperwork**\n\nThis is something I learned the hard way. You\u2019re going to come across certain things that take you a couple of minutes to figure out. And they will be bulky, but skirt the line between important admin paperwork and memories.\n\nFor example: I found scatters of 400 pages of my Gran\u2019s book she published in 1998. It took me a good minute to accumulate all of the pages. And they just kept showing up in boxes. For like 3 days, that manuscript was its own category. I threw them all together in the end with the \u201cPaper Memories\u201d category.\n\n**Label. All. Non-Obvious. Items.**\n\nThe term \u201cWhen organizing, you should touch everything only once\u201d, has a more important mental and psychological message, which is \u201cWhen organizing, you should DETERMINE WHAT something is, only once\u201d. \n\nThat folder in Tub #3 that just says \u201cWest Palm Beach\u201d. At first glance, you don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s in that thing. Could be anything, really. So take a look inside. Grab a pen and a notebook on a clipboard. Write down the contents of the folder. \n\nFor Example: On my notebook, the \u201cWest Palm Beach\u201d folder had homeowners insurance, property tax assessments, receipts, email correspondences, inspection reports, final floorplan, and a couple of other things I don\u2019t really remember. \n\nGrab a post-it note, or a piece of paper big enough to tape onto the outside of the folder. Write down, in sharpie, on the note, the contents of what is in that folder. \n\nWhy: When you go through the collection\u2019s stack of paperwork during \u201cRound 2\u201d, you won\u2019t have to spend critical time and energy determining the contents of every folder. When you have big bold labels on stuff, you\u2019re saving your brain from expending energy doing critical thinking later on. You really don\u2019t want to have to pick up the same stack of \u201cWest Palm Beach\u201d 3 times, and every time having to flip through it to figure out the contents.  Do the dirty work the first time, and you will save yourself the trouble later.\n\n**Use Those Baggies!**\n\nSo many things can fit into baggies! Notes. Tiny school portraits. Business cards. Newspaper Articles. They can ALL fit into baggies! Label the bag with a the container number they\u2019re in along with the category they belong to, and fill those babies up! \n\nMethod Established. Work Through Your Collection.\n\nGo ahead and sort the rest of the containers into your designated categories.\n\nSort Yourself As You Sort Their Stuff\n\nNever let your piles become super crazy and unorganized. If you have a hoard of labeled baggies just sitting around without being put into their main category, take the time to place them there. It is really easy to let the process take over your entire room/house/life. Don\u2019t let it. Clean as you work.\n\n**Rome Wasn\u2019t Built In A Day**\n\nRemember: Rome wasn't built in a day. It will take days, maybe even a few weeks, to go through every single thing. Especially if you're getting rid of their clothes and food and dishes, furniture, etc as well. You may have put off the boxes and tubs because of the physical and mental and emotional exhaustion it creates. You need to give yourself breaks, remember to drink water, and remember to drop everything and come back to it if it's just getting to be too much for you. You have time. And the process takes time. So take. your. time.\n\nJust as an aside: I really, really want to emphasize a practice of self-care that I had no idea existed until this: Taking your time. It's easy to have a cup of coffee and rush through half a box, but you will be burned out, exhausted, and super irritable every single time. Taking your time will help you be more organized and will let your brain go through the process with ease rather than make it feel like it's some sort of race. You will thank yourself. Remember to eat. Don't become too tunnel visioned. Don't get too caught up in what you find. And do NOT try to create more categories unless you absolutely need to.\n\n**\u201cRound 2\u201d**\n\nYou will end up with containers filled with categories rather than containers filled with \u201cUhhhhh\u201d.\n\nThe photo container will be a whole project within itself. Save that baby for last.\n\nSit down with a category and start figuring out if you need to keep it, keep it and digitize it, shred it, or toss it. The digitization process is also another project within itself. If you determine you need to digitize a document, shove a label on it saying \u201cDIGITIZE\u201d, a label of description of the contents, and then put it in a new \u201cDIGITIZE\u201d category.\n\nI have a method for digitizing and organizing your documents that I will probably write up another time (I\u2019m still doing this and figuring out a solid method. I\u2019m not finished, and I won\u2019t be for a while).\n\nLike with Like\n\nPut things related to each other in their own folder. In \u201cpaper memories\u201d, you will need to determine sub-categories.\n\nExample: \u201cPaper Memories\u201d went from a box of loose papers to \\~7 sub-categories such as \u201cPhyllis\u2019s Education\u201d \u201cLove Letters From Nick\u201d \u201cChildren\u2019s Artwork\u201d \u201cCards\u201d \u201cNotes\u201d and a couple others. \n\nAnother Example: \u201cPaperwork\u201d went from a box of loose papers to a crazy amount of sub-categories including \u201cSale of West Palm Beach House\u201d \u201cMedical Records 2016\u201d \u201cReceipts\u201d \u201cBank Statements\u201d \u201cLawyer\u201d \u201cMiss Kitty\u2019s Vet Records\u201d, etc.\n\n**BONUS ROUND: \u201cPhotos\u201d**\n\nOnce you finish everything but the photographs, you can move to the photos. But you will have trained yourself enough through the first process to know how to sort the photos. And it's basically along the same lines as subcategorizing the other categories. I have about 2000 photos, and I think I have even more at the bottom of another box. So far, I have 34 categories of photos. Everything from \"Roeltgen Family 1996 - 2006 Sonora House, TX\" to \"Cindy's Wedding\" to \"Strange Photo Tour of Cindy's House\" to \"Granny pre-1985\".\n\nI\u2019m still working on photos. It\u2019s a trip. But it is super rewarding.\n\n**All in All\u2026**\n\nYou will become much more comfortable with the entire sorting process the more you go through them. And it will get much, much easier. \n\nI wish you the best of luck. May the organization gods smile upon you. You\u2019re not a robot. You WILL get through this. And I am so, so, so sorry for your loss.",

    "text": "What an awesome post!! If you\u2019re ever in the DC area *please* let me know. I could use your help badly. I have two storage units filled with huge tubs of stuff from when my beloved dad unexpectedly died.\n\nMy mom never threw anything away - seriously - and she then lost the house. My husband and I saved what we could and tossed the rest. It\u2019s been almost 3 years and I still can\u2019t bear to go through any of the bins. \n\nThey are at least labeled into categories but we also have 28 file folder boxes of 4x6 photos. I don\u2019t even know where to start! I can barely check my email so scanning and sorting on a computer is going to be a nightmare.\n\nIt\u2019s so overwhelming and anytime I see a scrap of paper with my dad\u2019s handwriting on it or a photo of him I absolutely lose it. It\u2019s so hard. \n\nMy grandparents (99 and 97) moved into assisted living last year and we cleaned out their house of 70 years. Many bins of their stuff made its way to the storage units too. Sigh. Hugs to you and thanks for the encouragement!!\n\nI will print out your post and see if I can make progress. I\u2019ve been avoiding it and mom is totally useless, still clinging to every random napkin and newspaper clipping. But spending all that money every month on the units is becoming ridiculous.",

I didnt know if this was the correct place to get answers but hopefully somebody can help me. \n\nI just got delivered a couple new couches for my living room and was wondering if anyone applies some sort of protecting product to it. I've heard of some 3M scotch spray that people put in brand new cars and I was wondering if its worth trying something like that on new furniture.\n\n\nAnyone got any suggestions?",

    "text": "Honest mistake or bait and switch - wrong shingles were installed?\n\nI signed a contract to have my roof replaced with Atlas Pinnacle Pristine shingles with Scotch Guard in Pewter gray color. The new roof was installed a week ago and ever since that, wife has been complaining, saying the shingle color and width looked different (flatter looking and narrower pieces) from the Atlas sample shown to us. I thought that it might just be a batch difference initially. Yesterday, I checked the leftover pack of shingles and found out that the roofing company installed GAF TimberlineNS Natural Shadow Pewter Gray shingles instead, they did it without having asked us first. I have asked the roofing company yesterday and today for a work report detailing what's done and materials used. So far, I have not received a reply yet.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1.  Did the roofing company switch Atlas Pinnacle Pristine shingles for inferior/cheaper GAF TimberlineNS Natural Shadow shingles? (I am not sure which shingle brand is better.)\n\n2.  What's the best option I have? It's a large roofing job (4000+ sf). In principle, I could ask it be redone but it's obviously not economic for the company nor for the environment. However, I don\u2019t want to be taken advantage of, either, especially if the company intentionally switched it for a less quality roof or something looking less desirable from our initial choice. I thought of confronting them with this finding if they do not fess up soon (sending the work report) and asking for a discount. Is this the right way resolve this issue and what's the reasonable discount should I ask?\n\nThanks in advance for your advice.",

    "text": "Lowes bulk pricing on blow-in insulation is great.\n\nWe just bought a house in Missoula, MT! On our [list of projects)[[House Projects - Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ARNzjQ353gQ19jPYBOEcOIqASp9eZNQIr_h4ZvjW0nE/edit?usp=sharing)] is adding additional insulation to the attic.  We\u2019ve lived in this house for 10 years and finally bought it from our friend/landlord who owned the house.\n\n**A brief overview of the project:**\n\nI just blew in 65  [bags of GreenFiber R- 19 Cellulose insulation](https://www.lowes.com/pd/GreenFiber-R-19-Blown-In-Insulation-Sound-Barrier/3227256)  into my attic. \n\nAfter calculating the number of bags I\u2019d need and doing the math I realized that buying 70 bags at $4.87 is the same price as buying 100 bags at $3.41 (their bulk pricing rate). So I picked up 100 bags, used 65 of them, and just sold the remaining 35 bags on Facebook Marketplace for $100, bringing my total cost down to $241. \n\nThat cost doesn\u2019t reflect the time I\u2019ll spend wondering why I decided to blow in insulation on a day that hit 100 degrees, but that\u2019s my own problem. Hopefully, this can save you some coin.\n\n**Product details (brands/prices/purchase locations):**\n\n*  65  [bags of GreenFiber R- 19 Cellulose insulation](https://www.lowes.com/pd/GreenFiber-R-19-Blown-In-Insulation-Sound-Barrier/3227256)   purchased Lowes\n\n*I selected this product because of cost and convenience, It\u2019s a common material where I live and I already had 5 inches of cellulose in my attic, also: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Refuese. \n\n**Other materials:**\n\n* 3M Paint Project Respirator, Medium borrowed from my mom -  originally Purchased from Amazon\n\n* Tyvek paint suit purchased at Lowes - $13.48 [Trimaco XL Tyvek Paint Protective Coveralls in the Protective Clothing department at Lowes.com](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Trimaco-XL-Tyvek-Paint-Protective-Coveralls/50281813)\n\n* Eye Protection - $29.98 [3M Scotchgard Plastic Anti-Fog Safety Goggles in the Eye Protection department at Lowes.com](https://www.lowes.com/pd/3M-Scotchgard-Plastic-Anti-Fog-Safety-Goggles/1001845208)\n\n* Panic purchased knee pad from Lowes - $34.98 [TOUGHBUILT GelFit Pro Stabilizer Knee Pads in the Knee Pads department at Lowes.com](https://www.lowes.com/pd/TOUGHBUILT-Knee-Pads/1003095630)\n\nSome photos of the show: [Insulating - Album on Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/VMagzDJ)\n\n**Overall budget:**\n\nCost breakdown is in the Google Doc above, but 100 bales of insulation cost me $341 and I sold the remaining bales for $100 making the final cost $241. Add the cost of a one time use Tyvek suit of 413.48 makes the final cost: $254.48\n\nOther Reusable tool costs:  $64.96 for knee pads and goggles. \n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. I called Lowes to let them know I was coming so they could drop the pallets before I arrived. \n\n1. Acquire the blower machine, insulation, suit, and goggles.\n\n1. Drive 10mph down a 45mph road with two too tall pallets of insulation that probably should \nhave got me pulled over. \n\n1. Fix other attic related things before blowing in the insulation (new light bulbs and new vent hoses from the bathroom fans)\n\n1. Set up the blower machine and ensure the hoses can reach all corners of the attic.\n\n1. Start in the far corner and paint yourself into the exit. \n\n1. Be done!\n\n1. Clean up \n\n1. Return machine\n\n\n**Issues/challenges:** \n\n* I first attempted to go into the attic with 88 cent googles from Walmart and a KN95 mask with ear straps. This did not work out well for me. The goggles kept fogging up and/or the mask position was ineffective at blocking the particulates.\n \n* Our blower machine stopped working 3/4 into the project and we had to go to Lowes and get a replacement. We had clogging issues and because cellulose is \u201crecycled material\u201d it\u2019s basically just a bunch of ground-up garbage that included strips of plastic that gunked up the machine. \n \n* My knees were killing me so I impulse-bought knee pads, they helped but were also a little bulky because I got big ones. \n \n* I also used two 2x4x3\u2019s as braces that I could place across the rafters to get better positions with the blower. \n \n* This project is best done with at least 3 people, we had five (me blowing, my wife and mom feeding the hopper, my son relaying messages, and my dad project managing/opening bags/doing dad stuff) having several hands made this project go smoothly even when we ran into bumps.",

This is my first house and it seems like I bought the \"landlord special\" house. This exhaust vent would cause trouble in the winter by not venting properly. thus causing condensation to build up in the attic and drip through the ceiling into my bedroom. This would only happen if the heater was being used constantly throughout the day, so thankfully it didn't happen too often, but it definitely needed to be fixed. We chipped away at it and what the previous owner did was use some sort of paneling that seemed to be basically cardboard, cut a hole in it and attached the exhaust tube to it via scotch packaging tape. Then attached it all to the wall with a ton of spray foam. The last two photos is what we had done. It seemed like a big improvement already when we were halfway through and air was only coming through the hole that we cut in the sheet metal.",

Take a bunch of index cards and lay them out neatly in rows on some kind of impermeable, solid surface -- a table or plastic cutting board, for example. Leave about 1/8\" in between each index card.\n\n2. Cover the index cards in a single layer of overlapping strips of packing tape, leaving no gaps in the tape.\n\n3. Peel up all the tape, pulling from the corner of the first strip you put down, so the tape and cards and all come off your working surface as one big sheet.\n\n4. Flip the whole sheet over so the tape's sticky side and the un-laminated sides of the index cards are now up. Then repeat the previous step, so that the index cards are laminated on both sides with sheets of overlapping strips of packing tape.\n\n5. Trim the edges with scissors or a box-cutter. Fold up your Noteboard map-style and secure it with a rubber band.\n\n**or, using contact paper instead of packing tape...**\n\n1. Cut a sheet of contact paper to the size you want your Noteboard to be, with an extra inch or so of contact paper on each side.\n\n2. Peel the backing off of your contact paper sheet, and lay it out on a flat surface with the sticky side up.\n\n3. Place the index cards carefully in a neat grid on the contact paper.\n\n4. When you've achieved the desired dimensions, just stick down another layer of contact paper, trim the edges, and away you go.\n\n*Note: It's really easy to get air bubbles, hair, and dirt trapped under the adhesives. Also, contact paper works much better with some brands of dry erase marker than it does with others.*\n\n**Be sure to test out different dry erase markers on the laminate you'll be using before you actually make your Noteboard! Some colors and brands come off much cleaner than others.**\n\nI've been calling 'Noteboardsb and selling them. Reddit really seems to like them, and someone suggested I put the DIY instructions for making them here.\n\n[*(Here's the Noteboard website.)*](http://www.rgft.net)\n\n**TL;DR Packing tape turns anything into a dry-erase board. Put packing tape on a watermelon and you have a watermelon-shaped dry-erase board.**",

    "text": "Former pro painter here. We pull it dry. We don't have time to go back and mess with wet paint lines, seriously. You keep working and come back to get it later in the day. \n\n The thing is, there is a right and wrong way to pull tape. Believe it or not. Firstly, don't load up the line edge with lots of paint as some here are correctly pointing out. We call that dry brushing, as we have the minimum amount of paint on the brush at the tape line. Like 1/4 of what we would have on the brush elsewhere. In fact we never take a lot of paint into any corner, because then you spend all day pulling it back out. We start away from the line and curve into the line, only taking what is comfortable. With a good brush this is plenty. \n\n When pulling tape. and anybody can learn this in minutes, always pull at an acute angle. That's the method. So if I'm pulling tape from a baseboard I always keep myself 3 feet in front of the pull line and pull it evenly over itself, like a hairpin angle. Never behind it or even. Because it pulls the paint up with it. When it's coming off \"doubled over\" all the pressure at the point of separation is on the tape. Not the paint on the surface. If that makes sense. Like a lot of that job, it's all about angle. Don't get lazy and keep moving your feet to stay in front of it. You are in control of how fast you pull after all. \n\n This method has a 99% success rate and no other method is as good. We usually had to fix a little patch of a few inches between every 2 or 3 rooms. That's acceptable and a good day. Never had to score any either, although we use a putty knife to get up some stubborn tape once in a while. Which you can do with out causing damage. \n\n\n\nI tell weekend warriors all the time to tape it up tight and use this method for clean lines. Just don't leave it overnight. That's the quick way into a problem. \"Pulling tape\" was the best part of the day. It's at the end and all your hard work starts to look beautiful. And it's almost beer time. \n\nPulling tape is fun.",

    "text": "So I re-did my garage floors with Rust-Oleum Rocksolid and...\n\nI absolutely love it. I knew it was a daunting task and after reading and watching so many reviews (good and bad), I was a bit hesitant. I took a deep breath and went ahead with the project. \n\nTook me about 5 days of prepping, cleaning, drying, applying, and more drying, and it was all worth it. I can\u2019t stress enough that the prep part is the most important. \n\nTake your time, don\u2019t rush things, and make sure to let it cure enough in between sessions before applying 2nd coat and/or moving stuff back on it. Feel free to ask any questions or suggestions.  I\u2019ll answer as best as I can.\n\n\n[picture of my finished floor](https://imgur.com/a/ZyrJa8Q)\n\n\n\nThis is the exact step by step instructions that was left on an Amazon review that I followed:\n\nSome things to note before reading the step by step:\n\n++To prep your floor like a pro, skip step 3b and rent a diamond plated concrete grinder. Grind the entire floor and then immediately vacuum up the dust (please wear a dust mask)\n\n++To speed up the drying process, if you have a wet vac handy, use it and keep sucking up the water until the water is not murky anymore. Once it isn\u2019t murky, that\u2019s an indication that the floor is clean. Crack the garage and let it ventilate for at least a day.  Throw some floor fans on if you have it handy.\n\n++Step 7 indicates to use an anti-slip additive. Since I don\u2019t work on cars, nor park my cars in there, I skipped the anti-slip.  I\u2019ve read that the anti-slip additive takes away from the shine of the end product, so since I wanted it aesthetically pleasing as possible, I skipped it. \n\n1)REMOVE ALL THE THINGS FROM THE GARAGE (this was the hardest step). I ended up moving things out of both garage bays after originally thinking I would do one half the garage then the next half but honestly it just doubles the time it will take to complete the job. Our house and porch were packed for about a week.\n\n2)POWER WASH GARAGE FLOOR. I rented a gas powered washer NOT the smaller electric ones. The gas are more powerful. \n[WAIT 24 HRS FOR FLOOR TO DRY]\n\n3a) FILL GARAGE CRACKS WITH CONCRETE PATCH. I not only filled the cracks but also the separation cracks that collect all the dirt. So I wanted a completely flat garage floor and filled everything. Each box fills about 1.5\" by 10' - 12'. I used 4 boxes. The concrete patch is an epoxy. I used a medium sized piece of cardboard and mixed both part and A and B together entirely for each box. You only have about 20 minutes until the patch is too hard to place so move quick. I used a disposable puddy knife, mixed until it was all the same color and poured into cracks. THIS STUFF DRIES SUPER QUICK AND DRIES COMPLETELY HARD. Make sure to scrape up any drops immediately. The best way I found was to put some on your puddy knife and using the corner of the knife, drip the patch into the crack then scrape flat on top. I went about a foot at a time filling then flattening the top. Dries in 8 hours.\n\n[8 HOURS LATER OR THE NEXT DAY]\n\n3b) WET THE FLOOR AND APPLY DEGREASER AND CLEANER. The degreaser and cleaner did miracles on both grass stains from the lawn mower and all the oil stains from my 1984 Blazer. I did half-bay at a time and scrubbed vigorously.\n\n4) THOROUGHLY RINSE. Make sure all degreaser is removed. I made sure it all went down the drive into the drain but according to the packaging, the cleaner is time activated and safe after about 15 mins to wash away. Some did get into my grass and I saw no changes but obviously it can't be good.\n\n5) WET GARAGE FLOOR AND USING A PLASTIC WATERING CAN MIX AND SPREAD CONCRETE ETCH. This package comes with its own etch. The floor must remain wet and they suggest doing a 10' x 10' piece at a time. You will literally see a brief little 'smoke' from the effects of the acid etch. Be careful on rinse. Use a lot of water before pushing out the garage but again I got some in the grass and it didn't appear to do anything.\n\n6) APPLY TAPE. Tape the edges of the garage to easily paint edges and roll paint later.\n\n[WAIT 24 HRS FOR CONCRETE TO DRY AGAIN BEFORE FINALLY PAINTING]\n\n6) APPLY 1st COAT OF PAINT. At this point there should be no dust or dirt anywhere on the floor otherwise wash floor again, dry and proceed. Follow instructions on the bag on how to mix the contents. Move pretty quick because you only have an hour of pot life. Start with brushing the edges and then rolling. I ended up painting about a quarter of a garage bay at a time even though it said to do a 4' x 4' section. Keep a wet edge and keep moving. Be random with the roller to avoid streaks. \n\n**THROWOUT OR WASH BRUSH BUT DON'T PUT IN THE REFRIGERATOR. EPOXY WILL RUIN FOOD.\n\n[WAIT AND LET CURE FOR 72 HOURS. YOU CAN WALK ON IT WITHIN 12 HOURS]\n\n7) PROCEED WITH SECOND COAT OF PAINT. This time add 1 package of anti-slip per gallon of paint. As you paint, throw the decorative paint chips. These provide a nice finish and cover any discrepancies in the paint.\n\nWAIT 12 HOURS TO WALK ON IT, 24 HOURS TO MOVE MOST HEAVY THINGS BACK IN AND 72 HOURS FOR CARS. Remember to try not to be turning your wheel in the garage too much. It will eventually wear on the floor.\n\n8) Drink beer and bask in compliments from friends, neighbors and family.",

    "text": "Its almost summer. Find out what this heat and air guy has to say about your air conditioner. These \"weird\" tips will lower your bills! Doctors hate him.\n\nI'm your friendly HVAC repairman here to share my munificent expertise. I have 19 yrs experience working on mostly residential central heating and air conditioning.\n*To avoid common complaint replies, The following caveats apply to everything written here: This post is directed at middle class homeowners with forced air split systems (inside heater and outside air conditioner). This post assumes budget is a very real concern, and will lean towards cheaper DIY points as opposed to hiring a team of mechanical engineers to optimize your comfort/efficiency ratio. This post assumes you are fairly handy. Never do any repairs without fundamentally understanding what you are working on. Being over your head while working on your system can cost you lots of $$$ in professional repair or medical/funeral costs. Yes I know \"Freon\" is a trademarked name for a refrigerant.*\n\n**Your AC worked decently last summer, and just want to do maintenance:**\nReplace or clean your air filters. These are either in the return air grills or at the furnace. Air flow is king for a working air conditioner. Dirty filters throw off the working pressures in the freon circuit and can cause all sorts of chaos. Loss of efficiency and capacity, uncomfortable rooms due to low air flow, and freezing up the evaporator coil (which kills ALL air flow, can make a water mess, and can damage the compressor outside $$$). The cheap fiberglass disposable filters are enough to protect the system from dirt build-up, and allow the most air flow. Higher end pleated and electrostatic filters will improve air quality but will also get dirty faster and restrict airflow more. Depending on the house, and usage, you should change filters anywhere from monthly to seasonally. Most should be every 1-2 months, the writing on the filter package is meaningless. Change when there is visible dirt on it.\n\nWash your outside Air Conditioner (condenser), remove obstructions. Again, air flow is king. If your AC condenser coil is packed with grass clippings, stuck in a corner with fences, walls, dumpsters, its not going to work well. Do not put a screen around it. Do not build a shade over it. Do not put try to hide it with a lattice or any other enclosure. Your AC wants to be free with the wind blowing across its face. Use a garden hose to wash out dirt, cottonwood, dog hair, grass, etc from the coil. The best way is to disconnect the power, lift the top (try to avoid having to disconnect fan motor wires, otherwise take a pic to get them back on right) and spray with water from the inside out. Let dry before turning power back on if water got into electrical area.\n\n**Your AC has done broke itself, should you repair or replace?**\nIf your system is over 5 yrs old, *most of the time* it is going to have the R-22 freon. This stuff became expensive. The EPA got cranky a few years ago and accelerated the planned phase out to the newer R-410a. In everyday terms this means you will not likely replace just the outside air conditioner if it has a major problem. At minimum you will likely be replacing the evaporator coils as well. If you are replacing the AC and coil, many times you are getting close to the price of doing the complete system including furnace.\n\nThis situation reduces homeowner's practical choices. Air conditioners used to be replaced all the time for &lt;$2000 while leaving the older (generally longer life span) furnace and coil in place. Most of the time now you are looking at either patching together the AC or spending the $4000+ (sometimes very +) for a complete system. \n\nThem feds also bumped up the efficiency requirements for ACs. Its a regional phase out, but most systems installed this summer will be 14 SEER minimum. The industry has been prepared for this so the price jump isn't too bad this time.\n\nANYWAYS... Send me your questions. I will help you choose the correct duct tape and baling wire to hold your old air conditioner together. There are a ton of easy fixes out there that a handy homeowner can do to avoid us nasty repairmen with our exorbitant bills.\n\nIm also a high level sorcerer when it comes to geothermals, tankless water heaters, and lots of other arcane house needs.\n\nI do not believe boilers, chillers, and fuel oil furnaces exist. If you insist you have one of those mythical things in your house, please respect my beliefs by not asking about them. I live in an area of the US where we dont truck with them goofy things. *basically I'm saying I have zero experience with them and would be blowing smoke if I gave advice*\n\n\n**I will respond to questions not completely answered by others in this thread, you may just have to be a touch patient with me**",

For the sticky tape residue, try Goof Off, DWR, rubbing alcohol, mineral spirits, acetone.  These help dissolve the adhesive.  Any of these may leave visible marks though as you can change the surface texture or gloss level of the wall, so repainting may be needed to get a 'perfect' finish again.",

Dip a paper towel in it and then wring it out so it's only damp and try gently wiping/scrubbing at the wall.  \n\nAnother alternative is trying some rubbing alcohol since that often will break up the adhesive and cause it to pull free.  But I'd try the dish soap mixture method first.\n\nThe key thing is you don't want to scrub/rub too hard since that can mess up the wall.  What it looks like happened from the photo is that the residue has dust/debris stuck to it. So the dish soap method should help clean that off and the glue itself hopefully. But the rubbing alcohol should definitely pull the adhesive off.",

Just wondering if there's anything with similar strength/staying power of duct tape, that won't rip off chunks of wood and/or paint jobs. \n  \n  \nThe new moulding job on the walls and the door/window frames is pretty shoddy--none of it is sealed, and even the door frames are only held up by a few nails, so there are gaps of at least a few milimeters pretty much throughout. Naturally, this lets in all sorts of unwanted insects and spiders, which is getting to be a bigger problem now that it's summer. Duct tape works great, but when I peeled it off it basically took chunks of wood and paint with it. \n \n   \nBasically, I'm just looking for a way to securely create a seal between the moulding and the wall, so that no critters can crawl through. Masking tape and electrical tape all just fall off, but duct tape leaves nasty permanent damage.  \n   \n  \nOh, and I'm mostly looking for a temporary non-permanent solution because I'm going to be spending the summer in a shoddy dorm in the tropics with a roach infestation; I don't want roaches sneaking in through cracks, but I don't want to destroy the dorm with duct tape either.",

I used a standard plywood board (1/2\" thick), sanded it, put a thin layer of white primer and then applied a combination of joint compound and some fabric pieces dipped in a DIY mixture of joint compound/glue/white acrylic paint, and touched up all of it with a layer of white acrylic paint.\n\nI initially was going to use French cleats to hang it on this cement pillar my client has in her office (I'm an interior designer) but found out the screws that came with the cleats lock up when trying to screw it in using a drill. The special drill bit was able to go in all the way through but the screws just don't work. So I'm going to take off the French cleat on the back of my board and try something different.\n\nWondering which of the following is best for this project: 3M VHB 5952, Gorilla Heavy Duty Mounting Tape, or VELCRO Brand Industrial Strength (2\" wide, adhesive-backed).\n\nI would keep the French cleats and secure it to the board/wall using heavy duty construction glue, but will that one cleat (12\" long\" near the top be enough to hold the weight and not come apart if I used that glue?\n\nTLDR; I have a heavy board with plaster on it that I need to hang on a cement pillar.

    "text": "Are there any semi-permanent ways to mount a towel bar on tile without drilling?\n\nWe bought a new house with a beautiful porcelain tile walk-in shower. But the only place where we can mount a towel bar is in the shower itself. We're hesitant to drill into the tile itself because 1) I'm scared of cracking the tile and 2) it's super permanent. I tried using 3m VHB tape instead, and it was a fail. It slowly sagged over a couple weeks, leaving behind a sticky mess that was a pain to clean off. \n\nI'm wondering if there are any other semi-permanent options? Meaning it will safely hold the towel bar, but can be fully removed in the future. Looks like you can use construction adhesive, but that doesn't really seem removeable. In which case, I feel like I might as well just drill.",

I suppose a stud would actually be a good thing to encounter, but a pipe or conduit would be bad.\n\n2. I know for a fact that I have porcelain tile. Some spare tile was left behind, which I was able to find online. For this, I believe I should use a diamond bit?\n\n3. If so, I've seen videos showing that you should start at a 45 degree angle to get it to grab. Frankly, I don't trust myself to do that with any sort of accuracy. Could I use a [drill block](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QN4R2G5/) instead?\n\n4. What sort of anchor should I use? I'm not sure if it goes drywall --&gt; mortar--&gt; tile?

I use both the \"picture hanging\" ones that interlock as well as command hooks made for sawtooth picture frames/picture hanging wire.\n\nAn 18\" x 24\" canvas print is probably around 5 lbs on its own, and the frame itself is probably another 5 lbs. ~10 lbs is no problem for the picture hanging strips when positioned correctly (one at each top corner and about three inches up from each bottom corner).

I'm not sure if it goes drywall --&gt; mortar--&gt; tile?\n\nSo if you have drywall behind your tile (this is grey or green or purple board) your shower was installed wrong. The only approved backing is rock board or hardi backer panel. \n\nThe only way to do this without it leaking, you need to grout the anchors. I'd go ahead and call the tile guy who did the job and have him do it. You trying to save a few dollars might cost you a partial re-tile job.",

Will double sided tape harm the epoxy or leave a residue?\n\nMy wife and I just finished painting our basement floors with rustoleum's basement epoxy. I wanted to grind and use a 100% solids epoxy but we couldn't have help from in-laws with the pandemic, and we have a baby. Etch and water-based epoxy became the only option.\n\nI have already scratched this weak shit moving stuff around. It is not very durable and I have a home gym (squat rack, weights, etc) so we decided to cover that area with this rolled rubber mat from Menards: [https://www.menards.com/main/flooring-rugs/exercise-gym-flooring/amorim-reg-4-x-30-x-1-4-rubber-sports-floor-120-sq-ft-roll/730120/p-1523600980531.htm](https://www.menards.com/main/flooring-rugs/exercise-gym-flooring/amorim-reg-4-x-30-x-1-4-rubber-sports-floor-120-sq-ft-roll/730120/p-1523600980531.htm)\n\nWe will probably cut it into 3x 10' sections, and I'd really like to secure the seams together at minimum, so they aren't rolling up and catching the bench as I slide it around. Does anyone have experience with something like that? I have heard rubber can be difficult in the adhesion category. Would regular gorilla tape work or do I need to go whole hog and get 3M VHB (expensive)? Maybe something in between? I'm also tempted to use some double sided tape to stick it down, but worried it will pull up the epoxy or leave a residue when we pull the flooring up to move out.",

Each sign got about 40 inches of the double sided tape, and on to a painted wall.\n\nAfter placing and attaching, wife came in and asked if we could move one down. Upon pulling, it pulled some wall with it, so I immediately threw it back up on.

We taped everything off using the standard 3M blue tape and put down some Sherman Williams paint. We let the paint set and then pull the blue tape off only to have it take chunks of the paint with it. It's not just pulling our new paint down, it's pulling off the original paint on the wall as well as what looks like the top layer of the drywall? It's exposing a cardboard like layer under it all. \n\nI've done several searches online and can't find anything specifically about new paint tearing like this. One thread on forum discussed a lot of people having similar trouble with 3M blue tape doing something similar but no one pointed out a root cause. \n\nTape, paint, and pictures in the link. \n\nDoes anyone know what could have caused this and what we might be able to do to fix it? \n\n\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/OME4uKe",

We had a drawer in our kitchen where the spices lived, but it was impossible to keep organized and didn't hold all the spices we have.\n\nI took the wire baskets down, and because I didn't feel like cleaning up the ugly back of the door I decided to cut up a big sheet of 1/4\" PVC I had on hand, including a cut-out for the door handle. I attached that with some short cabinet screws.\n\nI printed these models from Thingiverse, using primarily the 4-count model:  \n[https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2763553](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2763553)  \n[https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:682449](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:682449)  \nI printed them on my Anycubic i3 Mega S, with the 4-count at an angle so it would fit.\n\nI figured out how many rows I could have, using those bottles, giving me enough room to comfortably remove and replace them. I started mounting them with the first row above the knob. I then calculated the space available between the rows and ripped a scrap plywood board to that width to use as a spacer and make things go way faster. From there it was just a bit of super glue and a very tiny screw in the outside spice holder holes (I might screw in the rest too, since PVC isn't great at holding screws on its own).\n\nLastly, I got out every spice in the house. I combined spares, filled the primary containers, and stored away the extras.\n\nWe've already cooked a few meals and it's soooo nice to be able to find the spice we need immediately (alphabetized), then put it back in the exact same place.",

    "text": "Are there any semi-permanent ways to mount a towel bar on tile without drilling?\n\nWe bought a new house with a beautiful porcelain tile walk-in shower. But the only place where we can mount a towel bar is in the shower itself. We're hesitant to drill into the tile itself because 1) I'm scared of cracking the tile and 2) it's super permanent. I tried using 3m VHB tape instead, and it was a fail. It slowly sagged over a couple weeks, leaving behind a sticky mess that was a pain to clean off. \n\nI'm wondering if there are any other semi-permanent options? Meaning it will safely hold the towel bar, but can be fully removed in the future. Looks like you can use construction adhesive, but that doesn't really seem removeable. In which case, I feel like I might as well just drill.",

I used a standard plywood board (1/2\" thick), sanded it, put a thin layer of white primer and then applied a combination of joint compound and some fabric pieces dipped in a DIY mixture of joint compound/glue/white acrylic paint, and touched up all of it with a layer of white acrylic paint.\n\nI initially was going to use French cleats to hang it on this cement pillar my client has in her office (I'm an interior designer) but found out the screws that came with the cleats lock up when trying to screw it in using a drill. The special drill bit was able to go in all the way through but the screws just don't work. So I'm going to take off the French cleat on the back of my board and try something different.\n\nWondering which of the following is best for this project: 3M VHB 5952, Gorilla Heavy Duty Mounting Tape, or VELCRO Brand Industrial Strength (2\" wide, adhesive-backed).\n\nI would keep the French cleats and secure it to the board/wall using heavy duty construction glue, but will that one cleat (12\" long\" near the top be enough to hold the weight and not come apart if I used that glue?\n\nTLDR; I have a heavy board with plaster on it that I need to hang on a cement pillar.

The main thing I would worry about is the pressure the wood would exert on the mirror and crack it, but if it's not warped too bad I would think it would be okay. you can pick up cheap clamps from harbor freight for about $3 a piece.

I suppose a stud would actually be a good thing to encounter, but a pipe or conduit would be bad.\n\n2. I know for a fact that I have porcelain tile.

Takes a few days if I remember correctly to get to full strength. This is a permanent bond, and you'll rip the tiles off the wall before the magnet comes loose.

We've separated the area via baby gate, but the wall mounting \"brackets\" (more like little u shaped holders for the gate) have started to lose their adhesion. Normally, one would just screw them into the wall as they have a hole in the center for those screw, but here is the major problem.\n\nThe areas that they're mounted on are right on the corners of some walls (see [photos](https://imgur.com/a/EnDhrSy)). I've tried to drill/go into that area, but my drill tells me that there are metal studs (or at least metal plates) there which makes sense as it's an older building that used to be townhomes.\n\nI'm wondering if there's some kind of alternative that y'all can think of? The only thing I can really think to do is just glue it in place (at this point, there's a combination of 3m adhesive pads and duct tape out of frustration on them) and patch the holes later.",

    "text": "Removed old tiles in 1950s rambler today. How much asbestos could have been released?\n\nI own a home in the northern Midwest, and we have been getting significant amounts of rainfall. Due to this, our basement flooded, and our carpet was ruined. We decided to remove it because it was a carpet and pad in one and there was no way to salvage it.\n\nWhen we pulled up the carpet, we found that there were tiles underneath it, which kept coming up with the carpet. Due to the fact that they were breaking/coming up entirely, we decided to remove those as well. Because the carpet was totally saturated with water, the tiles were very wet (which might be why they came up so easily). The majority of the tiles were removed when they were wet. However, some of them were dry when they came up, and they did break when we used an ice scraper to pry them up.\n\nAs soon as we made the decision to pull up the tile, we went out and got safety glasses, masks (3M brand, rated N95), gloves, etc. We kept the basement closed off, and didn't walk around the house wearing the clothes or shoes we wore down there. Once we got the tiles up fully, we put them all in contractor's bags, which we put into cardboard boxes and duct taped. We swept up some of the smaller pieces of tile and the mastic that came up when we scraped the tiles off, and that also went into one of the boxes. We plan on taking those to a dump nearby that takes asbestos products. My significant other didn't want to dispose of the clothes we wore, so he washed some of them, but I threw out some of the clothes I was wearing since I didn't want to risk contaminating anything. The clothes also went into the boxes with the tile.\n\nI also made the decision to get the tiles tested, just to make sure they are in fact asbestos tiles. A local company was able to take my sample today, but testing takes a few days, so I will not have the results back until next week.\n\nMy question is, how in danger are me and my significant other of contracting any asbestos related diseases? I've seen answers both ways, saying that it's unlikely we inhaled any asbestos because tiles really aren't that friable, but I've seen other sources saying that as soon as tiles are broken they are friable. So I'm just wondering how at risk we are? And also, how likely it is that the basement air is permanently contaminated.\n\nAny advice/help would be appreciated. Thanks so much in advance to anyone who replies.\n\n**Edit:** Oh my gosh! I can't believe how many replies there are. I only expected a coupe of comments, but you guys came out in full force and I really appreciate it! The information here is incredible, and I'm so thankful to everyone who commented. As a quick update, our basement flooded again, so we've been having a heck of a time getting the mastic up. Currently we have some Citristrip down there and we decided to let it sit for some hours so that it will have a chance to get the mastic off. We did go out and buy respirators that are rated P100 for better protection, but it's probably not necessary since everything is wet once again. Thanks again to everyone who took the time to comment and put us at ease! I'm really grateful!",

Keep your furnace fan on for a few days and change the air filter after a day or two. You can buy a section of hepa filter to use as well. But only use that for around a day as it may be too restrictive for your furnace fan. \nIf you are worried about the remains mastic, purchase some encapulant to cover the remaining glue.

    "text": "A first timer's guide for first timer's who are considering refinishing their hardwood floors.\n\nI bought a house about a year ago and had a couple rooms with bad floors. The statistic I'd seen (but never got quoted) was $4 per square foot to refinish a wood floor. So for the rooms I was looking at, it was going to be about $1000-1600 each. \n\nThe important thing is to know that your floors are going to look significantly better really no mater what you do. They're going to be fresh and shiny. I made mistakes on mine like not removing the baseboards (i think I may have gone crazy if I'd added that) but I saved a ton of money redoing mine myself and we hadn't moved in yet so that helped make dust matter less.\n\nSo here's a guide I probably should have made when I learned everything I could and did mine myself.\n\nFirst, You'll need sanders. I recommend:\n-Random Orbital Floor Sander (This is the slowest, dummy proof way. There are also Orbital Floor sanders which are round and spin to sand away, but can cause pigtails on the floor which are apparently noticeable/undesirable. Then there are drum sanders, the fastest way to either sand a floor well or ruin your floor. These are the sanders people are talking about when they're like \"start in a corner and see if you can handle this\". You seem to have plenty of wood to work with, by which I mean the top segment of your flooring is thick enough to sand. It looks like it's as thick as the interlocking middle and the bottom, so they've maybe never been refinished in any serious way which is good for you. These are easy to rent from Home Depot for cheaper, but understand you're going to be devoting a lot of time to this. Make sure you don't have anything else going on and understand that you'll be unable to go onto the floor after it's \"finished\" for a certain amount of time to allow it to cure.\n\n-Edge floor sander- [Look at this link](http://howtosandafloor.com/how-to-use-an-edge-floor-sander/) to get an idea of what I'm talking about. In my naivety, I thought a floor sander for the middle and a handheld sander for the sides. Like... a quarter sheet sander. They're both sanders, right? You need an edge sander. The carpet probably left staples in the floor so take plyers and pull them out, they will spark on the Edge floor sander. And I just checked Home depot for these too, they have two kinds. I used the Clarke and liked it a lot.\n\nThe hard thing here is that this sander is not fool proof, but it's fairly easy to pick up. Essentially, it's a big fast grinder. You get on your knees and you go in a pass, kind of swinging it back and forth. If you have a transition area like a doorway, just tape it off with painters tape or something. Or that's what I did anyway.\n\nMineral Spirits- These are like your replacement for anything you'd use water for in cleaning up a normal mess or cleaning the floors (no water or liquids in the room, especially once you've sanded it! I was super cautious about this since I think I read that the wood grain is pretty exposed right now. The mineral spirits are also how you'll help clean off sawdust. [this guide seems good for the cleaning process](http://www.minwax.com/pdfs/minwax-how-to-refinish-your-hardwood-floors.pdf).\n\n-Rags. Lots of rags.\n\n-A mop handle, to go with your special bottoms for spreading out the floor sealer.\n\n-special mop bottoms for spreading out the floor sealer. I used 100% lambswool applicators. You may also need to buy a **t-bar** if it doesn't come with one. This type of applicator pairs will oil-modified polyurethane. [see this guide](http://www.finehomebuilding.com/2008/06/30/whats-the-difference-floor-finish-applicators). But mostly I think if you use a roller, you're more likely to have bubbles. The lambs wool will shed. There are also guides online for keeping the hairs from falling out into the sealer, but honestly you're not going to notice. try to get hairs out before you start and then just do it. I would see hairs when the room was empty and I was done and it was freshly shiny. Then I never saw them again.\n\n-Finish. There are lots of these. I was recommended Poloplaz Supreme Sealer. It was pricier maybe, and I had to go to a special flooring shop to buy some, and lie a little bit. The place was for contractors only, so they were literally telling me, \"Fine, we will take this easy sell, but we aren't going to teach you how to redo your floors. We don't really have time and this is not the place for it\"\n\nShoe covers- if you are trying to get your floor into great shape before you seal it, don't track dirt or water onto the floor. these are good. Buy too many.\n\nScrap carpeting- This is one thing I ended up using a lot. That freshly sanded floor you don't want to get anything onto before it's sealed? Okay, where do you set the drippy bucket or bottles of stuff while in the room? Or even outside of the room. That super thick polymer coating, do you want it anywhere but freshly applied to the floor? I found some crap rugs that came with the house worked will for this because I didn't care about them. That being said, if spills happen, catch them early and use mineral spirits to clean them up with a rag.\n\n-Buy a big bag or rags. You'll use them on something over time.\n\n-Safety glasses! I used regular ones but [these ones](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01A12J3GI/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) would probably work even better and are similarly cheap. Oh yes, There will be dust.\n\n-safety mask. I used a cheapo one and have a beard, it probably wasn't the best. I don't know if you have a beard but if not, a half mask [like this](https://smile.amazon.com/3M-Facepiece-Respirator-6291-Particulate/dp/B000FTEDMM/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1510586760&amp;sr=8-12&amp;keywords=3m+mask+filter) or [this](https://smile.amazon.com/3M-Facepiece-Respirator-Respiratory-Protection/dp/B00AR63G12/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1510586760&amp;sr=8-11&amp;keywords=3m+mask+filter).\n\nIf you do have a beard, this is pretty awesome and I've just discovered it. and can be used for anything dusty/moldy you do in the future. [works like scuba](https://smile.amazon.com/Resp-O-Rator-Dust-Respirator-Model-JR-7/dp/B002KA0CMO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1510586882&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=resp-o-rator). The cheaper one in front of the mouth apparently can apparently get damp after a few hours, which this task will definitely take.\n\n-On the topic of Stain. Do not stain. The sealer will add the color you think you want. The stain will be darker, harder to apply well (if at all), easier for mess ups, and accentuate flaws. If you just want your standard, normal gorgeous floors stick to sealer only. Once you've sanded and are working on cleaning the wood dust up, you'll be \"washing\" the floor with some mineral spirits and this will actually show you what your floor may look like afterward. It's going to be surprising and satisfying. If you're still stuck on stain, read this [to make sure you understand terms](https://www.peteshardwoodfloors.com/Wood-Floor-Techniques-101/let-me-talk-you-out-of-staining-your-floor.html) and then go read guides for it. \n\n-Tack rags. These sticky rags are made specifically for taking dust off the floor. DO NOT USE THEM. A lot of guides will either not mention them or say not to use them. Instead, clean your floors with mineral spirit rags and lint free rags. Some even say microfiber clothes. So be it. But avoid the sticky ones. If you don't want to get anything onto your floors once they are exposed and sanded, don't wipe them down with glue paper. Cuz they'll get glue on them.\n\n-A really good vacuum. Shop vacs probably not good enough, or mine wasn't. I borrowed a vacuum from a neighbor fortunately. It had a big metal pipe and a rolling cannister and it was extremely strong and could suck dust up from between boards. This is going to make a difference since dust can hurt the adhesion steps.\n\n-Hardwood floor scrapers- [This is the one I found for sale, but the ones i had were just made of wood and honestly looked really shitty. They were just a piece of wood with a sharp, right angle blade on the end for scraping crap off the floor.](https://smile.amazon.com/Warner-10016-Triangle-Carbide-Replacement/dp/B00O5GG1KI/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1510592837&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=carbide+floor+scraper) These I think end up being more useful if you have things in your floors like pipes or if you have already got a finish on your floor. I don't think you have that, but there should hopefully be some cheaper than this thing on amazon. I didn't really use it but in the corners of your room either go with a quarter sheet sander or these for the first layers perhaps. Carbide hardwood floor scrapers... yea.\n\n-Sanding pads every sander you use will have a unique sanding pad it will need. They will need to have a range of grits to work your way from sanding up the crap, and then slowly working your way to higher and higher grits. [this guide walks through what this means](https://www.peteshardwoodfloors.com/Wood-Floor-Techniques-101/the-sanding-process.html). Make a judgement about your floors. I didn't use a pole sander and instead just got as close to the wall as i could with the random orbital. Also, when I went to home depot they said I could always just return unused sanding papers so definitely over-buy these. Once I found my rhythm, I found that the 400 square foot room took several pads for each pass. But honestly, initially, it was hard to tell if anything was even happening. It's a slow process.\n\n-tape/tacks and polytarp- the dust is going to be everywhere and on everything. Cover your outlets and vents.Cover the door as best you can. Maybe even cover the next doors. \n\nThe guide part:\n\nI've probably forgotten something you need, but I'll try to call things out as I go. So first of all, tape off your room. Tape it extra well. I had a lot of trouble getting painters tape to stick and used tacks as well. Do whatever you need to do. But know that the super fine dust is going to coat everything. It will be on the wall itself afterward. \n\nRemove your floor molding if you're going to. I didn't do this, and the front of some of mine look sanded and have floor sealer on them. I also never really notice and was going to redo them eventually anyway. But now I don't have floor sealer under them so if I replace or repair them, they just need to go back and cover those spots. In other words, your floor goes to the WALL but the molding covers the edges. I didn't do this step and may come to regret it but it's one more thing you'll need to pull of and put back on which is fine. The websites have a guide for numbering these so you can find where they all go afterwards when you nail them back in. [this one discusses numbering moldings](http://www.minwax.com/pdfs/minwax-how-to-refinish-your-hardwood-floors.pdf)\n\nDetermine where you're at in the floor process. How much grit do you need to start? It's likely 36-40, but read the guides above. Honestly, read a ton about the websites and get a feel for the process. Start sanding! Just remember, the random orbital sander is foolproof. You're not going to sand a hole in your floor, you're not going to get the pigtail swirls. It takes longer but you just keep moving it and wait to see changes. Check your sanding pads every 20-30 minutes at the start and get a feel for how often you should be swapping them out. This took a day and a half for us not knowing what we were doing. Wipe the floor up and vacuum between each pass. I think we did a couple passes at 36 or 40 grit to make sure we were doing a good job and because of the flaws we were trying to remove.\n\nVacuum well and move up to 60 and 80 and 100. It goes faster but can be hard to tell youre advancing sometimes. Just listen to music or podcasts (just realized I forgot hearing protection) [this is what i got](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00CPCHBCQ/ref=twister_B06Y3YSCSF?_encoding=UTF8&amp;th=1). I do earbuds under the hearing protection but have no idea if that's a bad idea. Seems better than nothing.\n\nAnyway. Sand the floor and sand the edges with the edge floor sander. Do a final pass over it at 100 grit to make sure it's as even as it's going to be. I see a comment from CharliesMaster that this could be a softwood floor vs hardwood. I am not certain how that would affect the sanding, but the random orbital floor sander is the slow and steady method to go with. Try to be conscious of how long you stay in one spot, especially with the floor edge sander. Also, pine may have more/different nails, so do some research about how to countersink these so that the sanders don't encounter them! If you have pine.\n\nOnce you're done with the sanding part, your floors are going to feel smoother to the touch. Once you're at 100 grit, you're not really taking as much material off, you're just taking the cuts out of the 80 grit pass (just as 80 is mostly for taking the 60 grit cuts out, and so on). The majority of material removal happens at the lower, rougher grits. So try to check that it's uniform and ready for Phase 2.\n\nCLEAN! You need to clean the floors up good. Wash them with the mineral spirits on a rag. I did this by hand because I lacked supplies and experience and it gave me an idea of where I was. The suped up vacuum is invaluable here, but just don't think you can use an everyday vacuum and be conscientious of how much dust is left and you should be alright. There's a lot of dust produced in this whole sanding step so do it several times and give it time to settle a bit between cleanings. Mineral spirits are going to give you an idea of what your wood will look like and they dry out quickly so just use it(and lint free rags) and get it close.\n\nAfter your floors are super clean, you'll ready to apply the sealer. This was actually one of the hardest steps. The time-frame required to allow the sealer to set, while not letting it set too long, is odd. Booties are a must here. You don't want your shoe in the sealer and you don't want the sealer on your shoe. Also, scrap carpet for setting stuff down (or tarp. I don't know, the carpet seems good) but the last thing you want is for the polyurethane sealer to get somewhere you don't want it. Follow the guides for getting your lambswool applicators as clean as you can (the new ones will have loose hairs). But know that you are going to get stuff stuck onto your floor. I kind of just started. There are some guides in the links I've posted so far about how best to apply this so read up, but essentially you just don't want to end up with too much or not enough. I tried to push it around in the direction of my wood and sort of paint yourself into a corner where that corner is your door. Apply it evenly. I think you don't want to try to wring the last bits out of the applicator by pressing down, and you don't want to rush it. Let it cure and set how it will, but not all the way. [Read this for cleaning](https://www.peteshardwoodfloors.com/Wood-Floor-Techniques-101/final-steps-cleaning-up-and-applying-finish.html) and  [DEFINITELY READ THIS](https://www.peteshardwoodfloors.com/Wood-Floor-Techniques-101/how-to-apply-poly.html) for applying. I know I said I used Poloplaz but the oil based polyurethane I think is the way to go. Or I did after a lot of research a year ago when I did this. This site recommends Duraseal, which you won't need to go to a specialty store for and will probably look the same. Your call. I also don't remember if I did the two different types they recommend here but I don't think I did.... \n\nEdit: I think they say one can will do about 400 square feet and that was true for me. I had left over. Better too much than not enough. If you're doing a larger area than about 400 square feet, I think you're supposed to mix them together to avoid having differences between batches.\n\nEssentially, you're putting this polymer down and it's going to go through phases. First, it's going to be pretty wet and sticky and flowing. Then it'll dry over a bit. You'll need airflow to the room because it's going to be giving off a LOT of chemical fumes. If you left it to sit long enough, it'll be completely done, but like painting a wall, you're going to want more than one layer. So before it's too late but after a certain amount of time [RELEVANT GUIDE](https://www.peteshardwoodfloors.com/Wood-Floor-Techniques-101/how-to-apply-poly.html) you'll resand the floors. The polyurethane is basically going to turn white as you flake it up and rough up the surface. If I remember correctly, I was super nervous and did this step with a handheld random orbital sander. I wanted to start building woodworking supplies anyway so I wasn't too bummed about buying this part, but yea. Just know that you're not ruining that nice gloss on your floors, you're giving the next layer something to grab on to. And you're going to do it again. And the guide says \"poor a 5 inch puddle along the wall\", Just saying I used like the pain roller tins they sell and that worked fine. I think I also just bought a big 5 gallon bucket and dipped it as well. This worked best because the tins felt spilly and weren't as stable.\n\nONE THING I recommend doing at this point is to like MAKE A CALENDAR SCHEDULE. It's going to be a weird time frame to, every 4 hours, be resanding the floor and reapplying. Because if you reapply twice, then that's going to be an 8-10 hour process. Did you start at noon like I did? Because you're going to be finishing late. Which is fine and I love my floors but get a schedule down so you're prepared for when it's going to start and end. The grit for resanding the in between layers is pretty high compared to the wood steps, I think I used 220 with my random orbital hand sander. [this guide seems to say you don't need to do sandings in between but I don't know if I believe that](http://www.minwax.com/pdfs/minwax-how-to-refinish-your-hardwood-floors.pdf). For the record it also points out you don't want furniture  on the floor for 72 hours and 1-2 weeks before rugs should go on. It's all about letting the chemicals that are going to vaporize out of the sealer to get out.\n\nI may be off track but okay, so you've applied your first layer of oil based poly and let it skin over and it's been 4 hours and you get your shoe covers on and it doesn't seem to stick to you. You are probably ready to sand it up a bit before your next application. Just get a nice even sanding. I didn't try to get the whole room one even shade or anything, I just made sure every area got touched. You'll see hairs and stuff stuck in the finish. Maybe even a beetle from the windows being open like I had (I even had screens in =\\) but that's okay. Just pick stuff out, sand, clean as best you can and get ready to apply your next layer. You'll basically do this two more times for the oil based. Then you wait a long long time for it to be ready to take furniture on to. I think I even waited a little longer because I was paranoid. Again, from everything I've read, it's really bad to put rugs down but big heavy furniture at least needs those 3 days.\n\nAlso for the record, I did my floors in the summer so it was hot and humid. This process can be different in the winter and I'd encourage you to read about those differences and what can be done. [this blog is seriously useful](https://www.peteshardwoodfloors.com/Wood-Floor-Techniques-101/coating-floors-in-winter.html) and was one of my best resources in all of this. If you have any questions let me know.\n\nWhat would I have done differently? I'd have tried removing my baseboards MAYBE. It was already a lot of work for 1.5 people (enlisted some help on sanding since it's foolproof with the random orbital floor sander, but the applicator and finishing steps were all mine). I'd have started earlier in the day for applying the finish. Once you start you kind of have to keep after it. If your time frame isn't exactly 4 hours, don't worry. Just look at guides and how cured/skinned/whatever your floor seems and don't let it go 12 hours or a day or whatever. \n\nWhat was I happy with 6 months and a year later? Well I will every once in a while notice that the baseboards of mine that were white look like shit but honestly this old house is a work in progress and I'll eventually either restain/refinish the baseboards so they're not painted or make new ones as a project. If you choose to remove baseboards, it'll probably be a cleaner process if you ever do things like that but this \"first time guide\" for first timers didn't include that. I don't think it's super complicated to pull off baseboards, but I think they can crack and so do your research on that step and buy the right tools. I'm particularly happy with the way my floors look. They look freaking amazing. Is there applicator wool stuck in them? yes. Can I tell 99% of the time? No. Does it look like there are errors in my wood floors? honestly, not really. They looked like garbage before. Odd light and dark areas, water damage and spills galore. Were they ever finished? Who knows. But they look gorgeous now, and that's the main take away. \n\nYou also say you want to preserve the current color. Not going to happen. You're going to sand it down and replace the color. But the oil based polyurethane will add color back. It'll look good. Try to find out what kind of wood you have and maybe there's a guide somewhere for what different woods will look like with finish on them. At least for mine, my floors got sanded down and looked almost like plywood or two by fours; in other words, very plain. But washing it with mineral spirits gave hints as to what it would look like, which is really good. And the Finish going on really makes it look good.\n\nThis process is going to be time consuming and tiring. More than you're probably going to give it credit for, even with this disclaimer. It's a 2 day process for a 400 square foot room if you do nothing but sand and apply finish and have all your supplies lined up ahead of time. That doesn't include rechecking guides and double guessing yourself. But you know what else? It is like $1000-1600 to pay someone to do it and it isn't like a \"must have\" for the quality of your house. Your floor looks old but it's still fulfilling it's function as a floor. It's not a gaping hole in your wall. I dunno. It was worth it to me to save the money if I know I can't *really* ruin it. A lot like raising a puppy. You remember your dog how it will be but potty training can feel like a special part of hell. But you get through it. Just take your time.\n\nFor an idea of the cost difference for this, I think I spent about $150 of floor sealer cans for the Poloplaz, maybe $200 total. The floor sander is Random orbital floor sander is $62 a day at my home depot or $248 for a week (ps, I'm not sure Lowes rents tools. Felt dumb trying to ask around for that). \n\nThe floor edger is $43 a day.\n\nThe hand sanders are each about $15 a day (that's for a quarter sheet sander for corners and an orbital for sanding the finish, but i think new ones are like $50-70 bucks each so reconditioned ones are probably cheaper and again, I was going to want some for down the road anyway. I probably spent under $1000 total, but over $500 maybe. And I had two 400 square foot rooms that I did so potentially saved $2000 or so.\n\nI'm not trying to scare you into doing it yourself, just get a quote if you want to and otherwise plan it out in excel or something what you're going to buy and how long it'll take.\n\nWell I guess this is enough of a ramble. Let me know if you have any questions while I try to find the photos of when I did my floor.",

    "text": "Carpeted room with generations of animal messes\n\n130 year old Queen Anne, with an addition shoved on over the dining room sometime later. Only room in the house that\u2019s not tile or hardwood. Carpet circa 1980s or early 1990s. Bathroom for god only knows how many dogs and cats through the years.  And maybe kids, too \u2014 I think it was originally built as a nursery or play room as it can only be accessed through a bedroom.  The whole room aside from the floor and doors is a sort of sadist level slap brush finish - heavy and sharp, more than 1/4 inch deep in places, and it\u2019s all white. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s even been painted or primed. Probably at least primed, water doesn\u2019t soak straight in if I splash a bit on. \n\nAt any rate, 30+ years of pet messes soaking into the floor. Didn\u2019t notice any smell when I moved there in 2009, but it had been repurposed as a laundry room (small closet beneath the attic stairs, just tall enough for a stacked washer and dryer, backing up to the upstairs bathroom so plumbing was handy), and at least 6-8 years of detergent and fabric softener spills pretty well overpowered it all, at least til we had to move the laundry stuff out (couldn\u2019t find modern stacking machines short enough to fit) and decided to finally rip out the carpet and put down something else.\n\nOnce the carpet was disturbed, it was no longer just an olfactory feast for animals. The stench became thick enough to cut with a knife, if you used a non-ferrous one so it wouldn\u2019t rust (our carpet knife did). Even with a window open (one of only two in the house that have screens), an ion generating Hepa filter, even putting my ozone generator (I have rental \nproperty and it\u2019s occasionally called for), the reek remained. It was bad enough that we sealed off the room in late spring when it started to get  hot, and just now got back to it. \n\nI took inspiration from movies and tv shows with morgues, and rubbed some perfume oil (spice bomb clone from Kingsley oils, good stuff - basically just smells like a room full of baking spices) under my nose, and that wiped out the stench, added some work gloves after discovering the carpet was literally sticky, and got all the carpet and the disintegrating padding shoved out the window (no carrying through the house and easy access to the bin)\u2026 and that\u2019s where I am now. \n\nStuff under the padding appears to be 1/4 inch hardboard, with gaps between boards. Under that is something that looks like rough planks over joists, a few gaps in the half inch range visible. \n\nThe stench isn\u2019t nearly so palpable, but it\u2019s there. \n\nMy wife wants to use the room as a wardrobe or walk in closet or whatever term you wish.  Fine by me - my office is the laundry room now, but it the machines are in a closet, I put up a small on the wall shelf next to it, switched us to super concentrated detergent and softener that fit in it - doesn\u2019t really take up any space,  so I don\u2019t need to move my office.  Essentially, I\u2019m saying I don\u2019t really care how the room looks when I\u2019m done with it as long as it\u2019s OK at first glance. \n\nSo: here\u2019s my plan and I\u2019m seeking feedback and an answer to an important safety question. \n\nAn enzyme cleaner sprayed onto the floor and at least a couple feet up the walls. Applied twice over 12 or so hours.\n\nWait a day or so for it to do its work and dry out\n\nZinsser BIN primer applied with a paint sprayer, completely covering the floor and probably the baseboards, too.  Two coats at appropriate intervals. If it oversprays to the walls, I don\u2019t really care. If the difference is too glaring I can always paint it, the room is only 11.5x11.5. \n\nMaybe a coat of paint to keep the primer from being scuffed up\n\nSome kind of flooring - we\u2019re still deciding between  sheet vinyl flooring and laminate. It\u2019s be hard to match the quality of wood in the rest of the house, and I\u2019m not screwing with tile again for the rest of my life if I can manage it. As long as it keeps the BIN from getting damaged and releasing the stench, I\u2019ll be happy enough. \n\nSimple enough plan?  Will it do the job?\n\nBIN is nasty stuff, I know. I\u2019ll have 2 out of 3 windows open. \n\nThird one has a window AC, I plan to cover it with plastic drop cloth and tape it to the window frame.  Sandwich bags and tape over the door hardware, glass covered with tape and plastic. Cast iron vent cover at floor level, I\u2019ll try to remove and just cover the vent, or plastic and tape for that, too. \n\nHooded coverall, gloves, goggles.\n\nHere\u2019s the safety bit \u2014 I have a p100 ventilator but no VOC filters. Couldn\u2019t find the right kind in stores. Picked up a 3m P95 mask that says it\u2019s for nuisance VOC. \nIs it safe to use either of those,  or should I order VOC filters for the ventilator?  (It\u2019s a slim fit thing, I got it when I was scraping down efflorescence  on the basement walls. Standard canister stuff doesn\u2019t fit it). That\u2019ll take a few days if I do.\n\nAny additional suggestions, cautions, advice, etc? \n\nThank you very much for making it through my long winded posting.",

    "text": "how to mark TREX stairs for my visually impaired spouse\n\nHi, all!\n\nWe bought a new to us house, and there are only a few steps out the back deck, but they are all the same color of TREX, and my wife had a stroke that affected her vision a few years back.   \n\n\nI need to mark the nose of the stairs, and as near as I can tell there are a few ways to do this, and they range from cheap to expensive. There is some lighting but not great lighting, and that needs to be improved for night time use, but daytime is also an issue for her, and the one that I need to address here\n\nCheap: Highly Reflective Tape or paint. \n\nthink: [https://www.globalindustrial.com/p/3m-safety-walk-slip-resistant-general-purpose-tapes-treads-630-b-yel-2-in-x-60-ft2](https://www.globalindustrial.com/p/3m-safety-walk-slip-resistant-general-purpose-tapes-treads-630-b-yel-2-in-x-60-ft2) or [https://www.zoro.com/rust-oleum-rust-preventative-spray-paint-safety-orange-gloss-15-oz-7555838/i/G6675669/](https://www.zoro.com/rust-oleum-rust-preventative-spray-paint-safety-orange-gloss-15-oz-7555838/i/G6675669/) or [https://ifloortape.com/duramark-rpt-750-reflective-pavement-concrete-tape-strips/ift\\_rpt-strips/](https://ifloortape.com/duramark-rpt-750-reflective-pavement-concrete-tape-strips/ift_rpt-strips/)\n\nQuestion for that method: what paint or adhesive would be best for TREX given durability concerns. I am happy to refresh once a season, but want to make sure it lasts for a bit and doesn't degrade the TREX.\n\nNot cheap, but not crazy expensive: hard noses -- most of the suppliers i see for those are in the EU (I am in the PNW of the US). I would worry that the edge sitting proud, but thats not an over-riding concern and my wife would get used to it very quickly:  \n[https://www.safetread.co.uk/anti-slip-stair/stair-nosing](https://www.safetread.co.uk/anti-slip-stair/stair-nosing)\n\nLastly, the other idea is undertread lighting: [https://www.superlightingled.com/complete-es32-channel-tread-motion-sensor-led-stair-lights-kit-dc12v-cob-led-lighting-set-p-4485.html](https://www.superlightingled.com/complete-es32-channel-tread-motion-sensor-led-stair-lights-kit-dc12v-cob-led-lighting-set-p-4485.html) but that doesn't solve the top-down vision problem, necessarily. The tradeoff here is that it involves wiring as well as ruining the night vision on the back deck. \n\nAnyone know of a clear path forward for this? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

    "text": "encountered lead paint during diy [serious] [long] [tw:s******l ideation]\n\ntl;dr: I unknowingly exposed myself and my husband to lead, I don't know the ramifications or next steps, and I'm sort of too afraid to ask but I need to talk to actual people who have been in a similar situation to see how they handled it and what effect it had on them. If you've never been in this situation, take this as a warning to take the highest precautions...if your house is old, ASSUME there is lead regardless of anything else, get a pro to at least verify safety, take the training classes for renovators, get the proper PPE, or don't do it. Obviously, hindsight is 20/20. I took the precautions I knew to do, but found out there was more to it after the fact. I thought I was doing enough.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon't make fun of me, be condescending, or tell me I'm an idiot. I already feel terrible. I'm extremely broken-up over this, had thoughts of s\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*e (called a hotline already), so don't tell me it's ok if it's not, but I need positive, constructive input only.  \n\n\nI was removing the waterproofing on a section of my basement wall so I could apply mortar where it had dissolved and apply a new coat of waterproofing. It was a 33' long wall and I went maybe 3'-4' up it, but only removed the loose paint, so although the total area was \\~130 sqft, I removed less than that actual amount of paint.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI removed it by tapping the bubbled-up portions with a hammer, scraping them away, and then using a wire brush on a drill to remove the more difficult spots. I was using a normal shop-vac to collect the scraps and dust, and had been putting the excess in a thick black trash bag because I know that paint shouldn't go in the regular trash. I wore PPE - tyvek suit, nitrile gloves under work gloves, and a 3M respirator - and took a full shower after both \"sessions\" of work. The respirator filters were NOT the NIOSH ones for asbestos and lead, because I thought I was just going to be removing waterproofer, which was filtered by the standard ones. I should have wrapped the furnace but assumed I was far enough away from it.  \n\n\nI started on a new section, around a corner from the wall I was working on and noticed the paint felt different. It peeled off in big chunks, so I suspected it might be lead, and I left that alone, but went to work in a different spot where the paint didn't have that characteristic.  \n\n\nI got a pack of 2 lead tests from Home Depot and tested the walls. The one where I suspected lead, the test turned deep red. Where I tested on the \"normal\" wall, it turned pink, which would seem to indicate lead present in a smaller amount. Then again, that's just two spots. I'm concerned especially with the \"normal\" wall that I may have coincidentally tested a spot with low lead, and the rest of the wall could be loaded with it. I could buy pack after pack of tests from HD but it wouldn't solve the problem.  \n\n\nI've abandoned the project for now but I can't just leave it indefinitely as it is.  \n\n\nStuff I've read online about lead in homes is really bad, like if you test sufficiently positive for lead with a blood test or if you have someone inspect and they find it, the EPA can force you to have an abatement whether you can afford to or not. If you can't afford it, they will just seize your house and force you to declare bankruptcy on it. Obviously, avoiding a test and potentially living in Lead Chernobyl in fear of this is counter-productive. I did some research on community resources, because my city is almost entirely built during the height of the \"lead paint\" era, and found that we don't qualify for abatement assistance because we make slightly too much money (literally $4k a year too much) and don't have a kid. Other sources said the city is having a hard time even helping the people who qualified due to lack of participating contractors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI haven't slept for 2 days and have quite honestly wanted to straight-up drop dead at times (I called a hotline last night bc of thoughts I've had. I'm not currently in any danger) because of the potential hardship I just opened us up to, which is 1000x worse than the original problem. I feel stupid and irresponsible, and basically too much of a fool to continue living. If it were just me affected, I could say \"sucks to suck, loser\" and just accept my consequences.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand, my husband and the guy on the hotline (not a pro but talked about his own diy experiences) acted like it wasn't a big deal...like it *would have* been, if I'd done the whole basement, up and down every wall, not worn any PPE at all, etc. and people all over the city are doing DIY renovations equally old houses. They both seemed to think the amount that could have reached the furnace AND was small enought to pass through the furnace filter is small, and if I just don't tear up ANY more paint, fill the exposed joints with mortar, paint over everything, and get the ducts cleaned by a place that uses HEPA vacs, it should be ok. Homeowner advisory videos from the city and state government show the biggest lead threats being lead paint in the actual living space, on doors, frames, windowsills, porches, and advise painting over the lead paint, regular cleaning with a wet mop/rag and sweeping with a HEPA vac, and eat calcium and vit C foods to reduce the amount of lead in the body. That contradicts what I read about people having their homes seized by the EPA, because it's like \"If there's lead in your home and you can't move or abate, just live around it the best you can by taking precautions\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my old neighborhood of brownstone-type houses, you could walk down the street in the summer and there would be people diy gutting the old houses in normal clothes, drinking beers or whatnot as they did, and you could see from what was being done that they were tearing out victorian-age stuff, so clearly I'm not the only person to have made this mistake and my house isn't the only one to have ignorant diy, so how do they deal with it? What is the effect?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got a lead blood test this morning and am waiting for the results. If they're high or low, I don't know what I should do either way. I don't want to touch more lead and find out. I requested some quotes on lead testing from local contractors. Being that it's a weekend, they will take some time to get back.  \n\n\nLast year, I got a quote on basement waterproofing (sump, vapor barrier, drainage system) and ended up not following through because, while I \"kinda\" could afford the financing payment, I decided against taking on any more debt. I might contact them to do the job and bite the financial bullet once the proverbial pieces fall and I have a better idea what's going on.",

The filter definitely needs thrown out with everything it sucked up, and I can easily buy another hose. The bottom part and outside should be easy to clean, but what about the power head? It only cost about $60 so I'd like to re-use it if possible, but I'm not overly attached to it either.",

    "text": "Attic Sealing Advice (Pictures Inside)\n\n**Location**: St Catherines (close to Toronto, US NY border), Ontario, Canada  \n**Home**: Built in 1970s, two storey home  \nI plan on air sealing my attic over the winter, or perhaps in the spring. Before I go and do so, I want to be as prepared as possible as I want to do this right the first time, and never have to crawl back up there again as it looks miserable. I will then either blow in insulation myself or have a company do it. But I want to get the air sealing out of the way first.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n**Pictures of my attic: https://imgur.com/a/mZYAd**  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n**Plan &amp; Inventory**  \nI do not have any bathroom fans, minimal ducting going up through there, no recessed lights (at least I think, I have old fixtures that hang down from the ceiling), and some other vents. I plan on using foam to seal around all of these, and the top of wall plates. I will be installing baffles and plugging the ends of the ceiling joists with fiberglass batts where the soffit vents are.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n**Maneuvering**  \nAs you can see, my current attic has about a foot or so of blown insulation. With the way everything is up there, I understand I will move insulation out of the way, do my work, then put back the insulation and continue this for the entire attic. My question is, (q1) how the hell do I move around here? It doesn't look like there is room to stand or to kneel even. Am I going to be doing this on my knees?  \n--edit  \nA question I forgot to ask is, what is under the current blown in insulation? Is it just drywall? If so, how the hell do I get around without falling through?  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n**Materials**  \n(q2)Should I use fire rated spray foam or will normal spray foam (in a can, I will use a spray can gun) be sufficient? (q3)Any other materials I will need? I plan on running baffles and using fiberglass batts to plug before the soffit vents. (q4)Should I consider caulk or other kinds of sealing products?  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n**Safety and Surprises**  \nI will be using a full face mask that has vapor and particle filtration (the 3M ones). On top of that I will be using a full suit and gloves. (q5)What else should I consider for my safety? (q6)Do I run the risk of my face mask constantly fogging in the winter, and it'd be suggested I do this in the spring instead? I cannot afford to get any dust or particles in my eyes due to an eye condition.  \n**Surprises**: (q7)What are some common surprises I can find up there, aside from animal poop and shady electrical? Is there anything I should look out for?  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nThese seem to be all the questions I have for now. If you guys have any suggestions for what else I should do, or how I should do this, please suggest them here, or if I'm missing/forgetting something. I want to do a thorough job.",

Last week a friend came to visit and tripped on one of the stairs, shattering the bottle of wine she brought, which cut her hand too. Fortunately not too seriously. But we definitely need to address the steps to make them safer. \n\nAll of the outdoor anti-slip/ high vis tape I\u2019ve seen says it only works on sealed concrete.

It's likely it simply won't be able to form an adequate bond with the concrete, and over time, water will get under it more and more and degrade the bond further.\n\nSome low-voltage lights near the step can help, at least at night.  You can also consider just painting lines on the steps with the same paint they use for streets and parking lots.  If it ever starts to look shoddy, you can always get out the paint can and touch it up, rather than the fuss of trying to replace the tread tape.\n\nDepending on the weather in your area, the size of the steps, etc., there's one more thing you can do that would work remarkably well without actually affecting the steps, themselves.  I saw someone with a similar walkway who put little colorful decorations atop the steps, on both ends.  They were so blatantly obvious that you simply can't help but look at them, and then you immediately know the steps are there and act appropriately.  Could be little flower pots or garden gnomes or stone dragon heads or even little smurf figures holding tiny signs that say \"Watch Your Step!\"  Done right, visitors will find it cute and charming, as well as practical.",

If you take the controller box apart you should be able to isolate the motion activated circuit and wire it to your interior wall switch instead of the light mounted switch. Regardless of if the motion detector is built into the light or not you'll likely need to modify if you want it controlled by a 3 way switch inside. Thankfully these sort of things are pretty straightforward as far as the wiring goes, and as long as you're comfortable with chopping it up it should be simple to figure out.

You simply need to interrupt the low voltage signal from the occupancy sensor with a low voltage 3 position switch. In one position, the signal wire from the occupancy sensor is connected; this is your auto mode. In another position, you have 24v supply constantly feeding the occupancy sensor input on the power pack to to keep in \u201coverride\u201d; this is forced on mode. The third position simply disconnects both inputs and the lighting load is forced off; this is your forced off mode.\n\nWith this method you can connect and control any 20amp load, even receptacle loads.\n\nYou will need a \u201cpower pack\u201d to switch your lighting load, with input from your sensor like this. This device also has a 24v power supply to power the sensor and provide a constant 24v feed to the occupancy input: https://www.amazon.com/Leviton-OPP20-D1-20-Amp-Occupancy-Sensors/dp/B00HRISW9O/ref=pd_aw_vtp_sccl_2/147-7385695-4533505?pd_rd_w=008de&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.4ae5968a-8b0b-485b-a9f2-bb26d29b191b&amp;pf_rd_p=4ae5968a-8b0b-485b-a9f2-bb26d29b191b&amp;pf_rd_r=Y014388C7RCAKR49DMKZ&amp;pd_rd_wg=e4Yzz&amp;pd_rd_r=963f8fec-874c-4aa2-8d9d-b759a0b597bb&amp;pd_rd_i=B00HRISW9O&amp;psc=1\n\nA motion sensor with at least ip65 rating (if used outdoors) like this.

Most 3 position switches will be the rocker style type switch so you\u2019ll need to drill though a block off plate to mount the switch: https://www.amazon.com/Twidec-Rocker-Toggle-Position-Waterproof/dp/B07LBNK71S/ref=mp_s_a_1_18?keywords=24v+3+position+switch+miantianed&amp;qid=1655295295&amp;sr=8-18\n\nAlternatively, you can also use two low voltage maintained switches if you don\u2019t like the look of the rocker style switch. You\u2019d keep both off for your forced off mode.",

    "text": "What's the best solution for cleaning gutters on a 3-story townhouse?\n\nI have a townhouse end unit and my neighbor's tall tree has these tiny leaves that pile up everywhere on that side my property.  Last time it rained heavily, I heard heavy water dripping sounds, so when looking out the window and then checking outside, I noticed water dripping down from the gutter edge rather than it being channeled to the drain.  \n\nI'm almost certain it's because of leaves/debris blocking the path, and before this becomes a bigger problem, I want to check and clean them, but the gutters are at the top of a tall structure, making it difficult for me to easily get to.  \n\nEverything's above ground (slab), so my ground floor is 8 feet (indoor ceiling height), my main floor is 9 feet and the top floor is 8 feet, so I'm assuming I would need at least a 30ft ladder (which I don't have).  Best I can borrow is a 20' one.  I live alone, so unless it's a really sturdy tall one, I'm not sure if a ladder leaning against the house is the best solution, but I'm not so sure I want to spend a fortune on someone else bringing in a crane or something if it's just that one spot where the affected gutter is only on the front corner of the house.  Any recommendations?  \n\nEDIT: Update - Another factor: Home Depot appears to have a 28' ladder you can rent for about $45/day, but ATM, it's unavailable.",

There is some lighting but not great lighting, and that needs to be improved for night time use, but daytime is also an issue for her, and the one that I need to address here\n\nCheap: Highly Reflective Tape or paint. \n\nthink: [https://www.globalindustrial.com/p/3m-safety-walk-slip-resistant-general-purpose-tapes-treads-630-b-yel-2-in-x-60-ft2](https://www.globalindustrial.com/p/3m-safety-walk-slip-resistant-general-purpose-tapes-treads-630-b-yel-2-in-x-60-ft2) or [https://www.zoro.com/rust-oleum-rust-preventative-spray-paint-safety-orange-gloss-15-oz-7555838/i/G6675669/](https://www.zoro.com/rust-oleum-rust-preventative-spray-paint-safety-orange-gloss-15-oz-7555838/i/G6675669/) or [https://ifloortape.com/duramark-rpt-750-reflective-pavement-concrete-tape-strips/ift\\_rpt-strips/](https://ifloortape.com/duramark-rpt-750-reflective-pavement-concrete-tape-strips/ift_rpt-strips/)\n\nQuestion for that method: what paint or adhesive would be best for TREX given durability concerns. I am happy to refresh once a season, but want to make sure it lasts for a bit and doesn't degrade the TREX.\n\nNot cheap, but not crazy expensive: hard noses -- most of the suppliers i see for those are in the EU (I am in the PNW of the US). I would worry that the edge sitting proud, but thats not an over-riding concern and my wife would get used to it very quickly:  \n[https://www.safetread.co.uk/anti-slip-stair/stair-nosing](https://www.safetread.co.uk/anti-slip-stair/stair-nosing)\n\nLastly, the other idea is undertread lighting: [https://www.superlightingled.com/complete-es32-channel-tread-motion-sensor-led-stair-lights-kit-dc12v-cob-led-lighting-set-p-4485.html](https://www.superlightingled.com/complete-es32-channel-tread-motion-sensor-led-stair-lights-kit-dc12v-cob-led-lighting-set-p-4485.html) but that doesn't solve the top-down vision problem, necessarily. The tradeoff here is that it involves wiring as well as ruining the night vision on the back deck. \n\nAnyone know of a clear path forward for this? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

    "text": "Removed old tiles in 1950s rambler today. How much asbestos could have been released?\n\nI own a home in the northern Midwest, and we have been getting significant amounts of rainfall. Due to this, our basement flooded, and our carpet was ruined. We decided to remove it because it was a carpet and pad in one and there was no way to salvage it.\n\nWhen we pulled up the carpet, we found that there were tiles underneath it, which kept coming up with the carpet. Due to the fact that they were breaking/coming up entirely, we decided to remove those as well. Because the carpet was totally saturated with water, the tiles were very wet (which might be why they came up so easily). The majority of the tiles were removed when they were wet. However, some of them were dry when they came up, and they did break when we used an ice scraper to pry them up.\n\nAs soon as we made the decision to pull up the tile, we went out and got safety glasses, masks (3M brand, rated N95), gloves, etc. We kept the basement closed off, and didn't walk around the house wearing the clothes or shoes we wore down there. Once we got the tiles up fully, we put them all in contractor's bags, which we put into cardboard boxes and duct taped. We swept up some of the smaller pieces of tile and the mastic that came up when we scraped the tiles off, and that also went into one of the boxes. We plan on taking those to a dump nearby that takes asbestos products. My significant other didn't want to dispose of the clothes we wore, so he washed some of them, but I threw out some of the clothes I was wearing since I didn't want to risk contaminating anything. The clothes also went into the boxes with the tile.\n\nI also made the decision to get the tiles tested, just to make sure they are in fact asbestos tiles. A local company was able to take my sample today, but testing takes a few days, so I will not have the results back until next week.\n\nMy question is, how in danger are me and my significant other of contracting any asbestos related diseases? I've seen answers both ways, saying that it's unlikely we inhaled any asbestos because tiles really aren't that friable, but I've seen other sources saying that as soon as tiles are broken they are friable. So I'm just wondering how at risk we are? And also, how likely it is that the basement air is permanently contaminated.\n\nAny advice/help would be appreciated. Thanks so much in advance to anyone who replies.\n\n**Edit:** Oh my gosh! I can't believe how many replies there are. I only expected a coupe of comments, but you guys came out in full force and I really appreciate it! The information here is incredible, and I'm so thankful to everyone who commented. As a quick update, our basement flooded again, so we've been having a heck of a time getting the mastic up. Currently we have some Citristrip down there and we decided to let it sit for some hours so that it will have a chance to get the mastic off. We did go out and buy respirators that are rated P100 for better protection, but it's probably not necessary since everything is wet once again. Thanks again to everyone who took the time to comment and put us at ease! I'm really grateful!",

If you want to walk your wife of the ledge a bit, try putting a few box fans pointed outwards at several windows and let them run for a day or two. Keep your furnace fan on for a few days and change the air filter after a day or two. You can buy a section of hepa filter to use as well. But only use that for around a day as it may be too restrictive for your furnace fan. \nIf you are worried about the remains mastic, purchase some encapulant to cover the remaining glue.

    "text": "A first timer's guide for first timer's who are considering refinishing their hardwood floors.\n\nI bought a house about a year ago and had a couple rooms with bad floors. The statistic I'd seen (but never got quoted) was $4 per square foot to refinish a wood floor. So for the rooms I was looking at, it was going to be about $1000-1600 each. \n\nThe important thing is to know that your floors are going to look significantly better really no mater what you do. They're going to be fresh and shiny. I made mistakes on mine like not removing the baseboards (i think I may have gone crazy if I'd added that) but I saved a ton of money redoing mine myself and we hadn't moved in yet so that helped make dust matter less.\n\nSo here's a guide I probably should have made when I learned everything I could and did mine myself.\n\nFirst, You'll need sanders. I recommend:\n-Random Orbital Floor Sander (This is the slowest, dummy proof way. There are also Orbital Floor sanders which are round and spin to sand away, but can cause pigtails on the floor which are apparently noticeable/undesirable. Then there are drum sanders, the fastest way to either sand a floor well or ruin your floor. These are the sanders people are talking about when they're like \"start in a corner and see if you can handle this\". You seem to have plenty of wood to work with, by which I mean the top segment of your flooring is thick enough to sand. It looks like it's as thick as the interlocking middle and the bottom, so they've maybe never been refinished in any serious way which is good for you. These are easy to rent from Home Depot for cheaper, but understand you're going to be devoting a lot of time to this. Make sure you don't have anything else going on and understand that you'll be unable to go onto the floor after it's \"finished\" for a certain amount of time to allow it to cure.\n\n-Edge floor sander- [Look at this link](http://howtosandafloor.com/how-to-use-an-edge-floor-sander/) to get an idea of what I'm talking about. In my naivety, I thought a floor sander for the middle and a handheld sander for the sides. Like... a quarter sheet sander. They're both sanders, right? You need an edge sander. The carpet probably left staples in the floor so take plyers and pull them out, they will spark on the Edge floor sander. And I just checked Home depot for these too, they have two kinds. I used the Clarke and liked it a lot.\n\nThe hard thing here is that this sander is not fool proof, but it's fairly easy to pick up. Essentially, it's a big fast grinder. You get on your knees and you go in a pass, kind of swinging it back and forth. If you have a transition area like a doorway, just tape it off with painters tape or something. Or that's what I did anyway.\n\nMineral Spirits- These are like your replacement for anything you'd use water for in cleaning up a normal mess or cleaning the floors (no water or liquids in the room, especially once you've sanded it! I was super cautious about this since I think I read that the wood grain is pretty exposed right now. The mineral spirits are also how you'll help clean off sawdust. [this guide seems good for the cleaning process](http://www.minwax.com/pdfs/minwax-how-to-refinish-your-hardwood-floors.pdf).\n\n-Rags. Lots of rags.\n\n-A mop handle, to go with your special bottoms for spreading out the floor sealer.\n\n-special mop bottoms for spreading out the floor sealer. I used 100% lambswool applicators. You may also need to buy a **t-bar** if it doesn't come with one. This type of applicator pairs will oil-modified polyurethane. [see this guide](http://www.finehomebuilding.com/2008/06/30/whats-the-difference-floor-finish-applicators). But mostly I think if you use a roller, you're more likely to have bubbles. The lambs wool will shed. There are also guides online for keeping the hairs from falling out into the sealer, but honestly you're not going to notice. try to get hairs out before you start and then just do it. I would see hairs when the room was empty and I was done and it was freshly shiny. Then I never saw them again.\n\n-Finish. There are lots of these. I was recommended Poloplaz Supreme Sealer. It was pricier maybe, and I had to go to a special flooring shop to buy some, and lie a little bit. The place was for contractors only, so they were literally telling me, \"Fine, we will take this easy sell, but we aren't going to teach you how to redo your floors. We don't really have time and this is not the place for it\"\n\nShoe covers- if you are trying to get your floor into great shape before you seal it, don't track dirt or water onto the floor. these are good. Buy too many.\n\nScrap carpeting- This is one thing I ended up using a lot. That freshly sanded floor you don't want to get anything onto before it's sealed? Okay, where do you set the drippy bucket or bottles of stuff while in the room? Or even outside of the room. That super thick polymer coating, do you want it anywhere but freshly applied to the floor? I found some crap rugs that came with the house worked will for this because I didn't care about them. That being said, if spills happen, catch them early and use mineral spirits to clean them up with a rag.\n\n-Buy a big bag or rags. You'll use them on something over time.\n\n-Safety glasses! I used regular ones but [these ones](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01A12J3GI/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) would probably work even better and are similarly cheap. Oh yes, There will be dust.\n\n-safety mask. I used a cheapo one and have a beard, it probably wasn't the best. I don't know if you have a beard but if not, a half mask [like this](https://smile.amazon.com/3M-Facepiece-Respirator-6291-Particulate/dp/B000FTEDMM/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1510586760&amp;sr=8-12&amp;keywords=3m+mask+filter) or [this](https://smile.amazon.com/3M-Facepiece-Respirator-Respiratory-Protection/dp/B00AR63G12/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1510586760&amp;sr=8-11&amp;keywords=3m+mask+filter).\n\nIf you do have a beard, this is pretty awesome and I've just discovered it. and can be used for anything dusty/moldy you do in the future. [works like scuba](https://smile.amazon.com/Resp-O-Rator-Dust-Respirator-Model-JR-7/dp/B002KA0CMO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1510586882&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=resp-o-rator). The cheaper one in front of the mouth apparently can apparently get damp after a few hours, which this task will definitely take.\n\n-On the topic of Stain. Do not stain. The sealer will add the color you think you want. The stain will be darker, harder to apply well (if at all), easier for mess ups, and accentuate flaws. If you just want your standard, normal gorgeous floors stick to sealer only. Once you've sanded and are working on cleaning the wood dust up, you'll be \"washing\" the floor with some mineral spirits and this will actually show you what your floor may look like afterward. It's going to be surprising and satisfying. If you're still stuck on stain, read this [to make sure you understand terms](https://www.peteshardwoodfloors.com/Wood-Floor-Techniques-101/let-me-talk-you-out-of-staining-your-floor.html) and then go read guides for it. \n\n-Tack rags. These sticky rags are made specifically for taking dust off the floor. DO NOT USE THEM. A lot of guides will either not mention them or say not to use them. Instead, clean your floors with mineral spirit rags and lint free rags. Some even say microfiber clothes. So be it. But avoid the sticky ones. If you don't want to get anything onto your floors once they are exposed and sanded, don't wipe them down with glue paper. Cuz they'll get glue on them.\n\n-A really good vacuum. Shop vacs probably not good enough, or mine wasn't. I borrowed a vacuum from a neighbor fortunately. It had a big metal pipe and a rolling cannister and it was extremely strong and could suck dust up from between boards. This is going to make a difference since dust can hurt the adhesion steps.\n\n-Hardwood floor scrapers- [This is the one I found for sale, but the ones i had were just made of wood and honestly looked really shitty. They were just a piece of wood with a sharp, right angle blade on the end for scraping crap off the floor.](https://smile.amazon.com/Warner-10016-Triangle-Carbide-Replacement/dp/B00O5GG1KI/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1510592837&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=carbide+floor+scraper) These I think end up being more useful if you have things in your floors like pipes or if you have already got a finish on your floor. I don't think you have that, but there should hopefully be some cheaper than this thing on amazon. I didn't really use it but in the corners of your room either go with a quarter sheet sander or these for the first layers perhaps. Carbide hardwood floor scrapers... yea.\n\n-Sanding pads every sander you use will have a unique sanding pad it will need. They will need to have a range of grits to work your way from sanding up the crap, and then slowly working your way to higher and higher grits. [this guide walks through what this means](https://www.peteshardwoodfloors.com/Wood-Floor-Techniques-101/the-sanding-process.html). Make a judgement about your floors. I didn't use a pole sander and instead just got as close to the wall as i could with the random orbital. Also, when I went to home depot they said I could always just return unused sanding papers so definitely over-buy these. Once I found my rhythm, I found that the 400 square foot room took several pads for each pass. But honestly, initially, it was hard to tell if anything was even happening. It's a slow process.\n\n-tape/tacks and polytarp- the dust is going to be everywhere and on everything. Cover your outlets and vents.Cover the door as best you can. Maybe even cover the next doors. \n\nThe guide part:\n\nI've probably forgotten something you need, but I'll try to call things out as I go. So first of all, tape off your room. Tape it extra well. I had a lot of trouble getting painters tape to stick and used tacks as well. Do whatever you need to do. But know that the super fine dust is going to coat everything. It will be on the wall itself afterward. \n\nRemove your floor molding if you're going to. I didn't do this, and the front of some of mine look sanded and have floor sealer on them. I also never really notice and was going to redo them eventually anyway. But now I don't have floor sealer under them so if I replace or repair them, they just need to go back and cover those spots. In other words, your floor goes to the WALL but the molding covers the edges. I didn't do this step and may come to regret it but it's one more thing you'll need to pull of and put back on which is fine. The websites have a guide for numbering these so you can find where they all go afterwards when you nail them back in. [this one discusses numbering moldings](http://www.minwax.com/pdfs/minwax-how-to-refinish-your-hardwood-floors.pdf)\n\nDetermine where you're at in the floor process. How much grit do you need to start? It's likely 36-40, but read the guides above. Honestly, read a ton about the websites and get a feel for the process. Start sanding! Just remember, the random orbital sander is foolproof. You're not going to sand a hole in your floor, you're not going to get the pigtail swirls. It takes longer but you just keep moving it and wait to see changes. Check your sanding pads every 20-30 minutes at the start and get a feel for how often you should be swapping them out. This took a day and a half for us not knowing what we were doing. Wipe the floor up and vacuum between each pass. I think we did a couple passes at 36 or 40 grit to make sure we were doing a good job and because of the flaws we were trying to remove.\n\nVacuum well and move up to 60 and 80 and 100. It goes faster but can be hard to tell youre advancing sometimes. Just listen to music or podcasts (just realized I forgot hearing protection) [this is what i got](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00CPCHBCQ/ref=twister_B06Y3YSCSF?_encoding=UTF8&amp;th=1). I do earbuds under the hearing protection but have no idea if that's a bad idea. Seems better than nothing.\n\nAnyway. Sand the floor and sand the edges with the edge floor sander. Do a final pass over it at 100 grit to make sure it's as even as it's going to be. I see a comment from CharliesMaster that this could be a softwood floor vs hardwood. I am not certain how that would affect the sanding, but the random orbital floor sander is the slow and steady method to go with. Try to be conscious of how long you stay in one spot, especially with the floor edge sander. Also, pine may have more/different nails, so do some research about how to countersink these so that the sanders don't encounter them! If you have pine.\n\nOnce you're done with the sanding part, your floors are going to feel smoother to the touch. Once you're at 100 grit, you're not really taking as much material off, you're just taking the cuts out of the 80 grit pass (just as 80 is mostly for taking the 60 grit cuts out, and so on). The majority of material removal happens at the lower, rougher grits. So try to check that it's uniform and ready for Phase 2.\n\nCLEAN! You need to clean the floors up good. Wash them with the mineral spirits on a rag. I did this by hand because I lacked supplies and experience and it gave me an idea of where I was. The suped up vacuum is invaluable here, but just don't think you can use an everyday vacuum and be conscientious of how much dust is left and you should be alright. There's a lot of dust produced in this whole sanding step so do it several times and give it time to settle a bit between cleanings. Mineral spirits are going to give you an idea of what your wood will look like and they dry out quickly so just use it(and lint free rags) and get it close.\n\nAfter your floors are super clean, you'll ready to apply the sealer. This was actually one of the hardest steps. The time-frame required to allow the sealer to set, while not letting it set too long, is odd. Booties are a must here. You don't want your shoe in the sealer and you don't want the sealer on your shoe. Also, scrap carpet for setting stuff down (or tarp. I don't know, the carpet seems good) but the last thing you want is for the polyurethane sealer to get somewhere you don't want it. Follow the guides for getting your lambswool applicators as clean as you can (the new ones will have loose hairs). But know that you are going to get stuff stuck onto your floor. I kind of just started. There are some guides in the links I've posted so far about how best to apply this so read up, but essentially you just don't want to end up with too much or not enough. I tried to push it around in the direction of my wood and sort of paint yourself into a corner where that corner is your door. Apply it evenly. I think you don't want to try to wring the last bits out of the applicator by pressing down, and you don't want to rush it. Let it cure and set how it will, but not all the way. [Read this for cleaning](https://www.peteshardwoodfloors.com/Wood-Floor-Techniques-101/final-steps-cleaning-up-and-applying-finish.html) and  [DEFINITELY READ THIS](https://www.peteshardwoodfloors.com/Wood-Floor-Techniques-101/how-to-apply-poly.html) for applying. I know I said I used Poloplaz but the oil based polyurethane I think is the way to go. Or I did after a lot of research a year ago when I did this. This site recommends Duraseal, which you won't need to go to a specialty store for and will probably look the same. Your call. I also don't remember if I did the two different types they recommend here but I don't think I did.... \n\nEdit: I think they say one can will do about 400 square feet and that was true for me. I had left over. Better too much than not enough. If you're doing a larger area than about 400 square feet, I think you're supposed to mix them together to avoid having differences between batches.\n\nEssentially, you're putting this polymer down and it's going to go through phases. First, it's going to be pretty wet and sticky and flowing. Then it'll dry over a bit. You'll need airflow to the room because it's going to be giving off a LOT of chemical fumes. If you left it to sit long enough, it'll be completely done, but like painting a wall, you're going to want more than one layer. So before it's too late but after a certain amount of time [RELEVANT GUIDE](https://www.peteshardwoodfloors.com/Wood-Floor-Techniques-101/how-to-apply-poly.html) you'll resand the floors. The polyurethane is basically going to turn white as you flake it up and rough up the surface. If I remember correctly, I was super nervous and did this step with a handheld random orbital sander. I wanted to start building woodworking supplies anyway so I wasn't too bummed about buying this part, but yea. Just know that you're not ruining that nice gloss on your floors, you're giving the next layer something to grab on to. And you're going to do it again. And the guide says \"poor a 5 inch puddle along the wall\", Just saying I used like the pain roller tins they sell and that worked fine. I think I also just bought a big 5 gallon bucket and dipped it as well. This worked best because the tins felt spilly and weren't as stable.\n\nONE THING I recommend doing at this point is to like MAKE A CALENDAR SCHEDULE. It's going to be a weird time frame to, every 4 hours, be resanding the floor and reapplying. Because if you reapply twice, then that's going to be an 8-10 hour process. Did you start at noon like I did? Because you're going to be finishing late. Which is fine and I love my floors but get a schedule down so you're prepared for when it's going to start and end. The grit for resanding the in between layers is pretty high compared to the wood steps, I think I used 220 with my random orbital hand sander. [this guide seems to say you don't need to do sandings in between but I don't know if I believe that](http://www.minwax.com/pdfs/minwax-how-to-refinish-your-hardwood-floors.pdf). For the record it also points out you don't want furniture  on the floor for 72 hours and 1-2 weeks before rugs should go on. It's all about letting the chemicals that are going to vaporize out of the sealer to get out.\n\nI may be off track but okay, so you've applied your first layer of oil based poly and let it skin over and it's been 4 hours and you get your shoe covers on and it doesn't seem to stick to you. You are probably ready to sand it up a bit before your next application. Just get a nice even sanding. I didn't try to get the whole room one even shade or anything, I just made sure every area got touched. You'll see hairs and stuff stuck in the finish. Maybe even a beetle from the windows being open like I had (I even had screens in =\\) but that's okay. Just pick stuff out, sand, clean as best you can and get ready to apply your next layer. You'll basically do this two more times for the oil based. Then you wait a long long time for it to be ready to take furniture on to. I think I even waited a little longer because I was paranoid. Again, from everything I've read, it's really bad to put rugs down but big heavy furniture at least needs those 3 days.\n\nAlso for the record, I did my floors in the summer so it was hot and humid. This process can be different in the winter and I'd encourage you to read about those differences and what can be done. [this blog is seriously useful](https://www.peteshardwoodfloors.com/Wood-Floor-Techniques-101/coating-floors-in-winter.html) and was one of my best resources in all of this. If you have any questions let me know.\n\nWhat would I have done differently? I'd have tried removing my baseboards MAYBE. It was already a lot of work for 1.5 people (enlisted some help on sanding since it's foolproof with the random orbital floor sander, but the applicator and finishing steps were all mine). I'd have started earlier in the day for applying the finish. Once you start you kind of have to keep after it. If your time frame isn't exactly 4 hours, don't worry. Just look at guides and how cured/skinned/whatever your floor seems and don't let it go 12 hours or a day or whatever. \n\nWhat was I happy with 6 months and a year later? Well I will every once in a while notice that the baseboards of mine that were white look like shit but honestly this old house is a work in progress and I'll eventually either restain/refinish the baseboards so they're not painted or make new ones as a project. If you choose to remove baseboards, it'll probably be a cleaner process if you ever do things like that but this \"first time guide\" for first timers didn't include that. I don't think it's super complicated to pull off baseboards, but I think they can crack and so do your research on that step and buy the right tools. I'm particularly happy with the way my floors look. They look freaking amazing. Is there applicator wool stuck in them? yes. Can I tell 99% of the time? No. Does it look like there are errors in my wood floors? honestly, not really. They looked like garbage before. Odd light and dark areas, water damage and spills galore. Were they ever finished? Who knows. But they look gorgeous now, and that's the main take away. \n\nYou also say you want to preserve the current color. Not going to happen. You're going to sand it down and replace the color. But the oil based polyurethane will add color back. It'll look good. Try to find out what kind of wood you have and maybe there's a guide somewhere for what different woods will look like with finish on them. At least for mine, my floors got sanded down and looked almost like plywood or two by fours; in other words, very plain. But washing it with mineral spirits gave hints as to what it would look like, which is really good. And the Finish going on really makes it look good.\n\nThis process is going to be time consuming and tiring. More than you're probably going to give it credit for, even with this disclaimer. It's a 2 day process for a 400 square foot room if you do nothing but sand and apply finish and have all your supplies lined up ahead of time. That doesn't include rechecking guides and double guessing yourself. But you know what else? It is like $1000-1600 to pay someone to do it and it isn't like a \"must have\" for the quality of your house. Your floor looks old but it's still fulfilling it's function as a floor. It's not a gaping hole in your wall. I dunno. It was worth it to me to save the money if I know I can't *really* ruin it. A lot like raising a puppy. You remember your dog how it will be but potty training can feel like a special part of hell. But you get through it. Just take your time.\n\nFor an idea of the cost difference for this, I think I spent about $150 of floor sealer cans for the Poloplaz, maybe $200 total. The floor sander is Random orbital floor sander is $62 a day at my home depot or $248 for a week (ps, I'm not sure Lowes rents tools. Felt dumb trying to ask around for that). \n\nThe floor edger is $43 a day.\n\nThe hand sanders are each about $15 a day (that's for a quarter sheet sander for corners and an orbital for sanding the finish, but i think new ones are like $50-70 bucks each so reconditioned ones are probably cheaper and again, I was going to want some for down the road anyway. I probably spent under $1000 total, but over $500 maybe. And I had two 400 square foot rooms that I did so potentially saved $2000 or so.\n\nI'm not trying to scare you into doing it yourself, just get a quote if you want to and otherwise plan it out in excel or something what you're going to buy and how long it'll take.\n\nWell I guess this is enough of a ramble. Let me know if you have any questions while I try to find the photos of when I did my floor.",

    "text": "encountered lead paint during diy [serious] [long] [tw:s******l ideation]\n\ntl;dr: I unknowingly exposed myself and my husband to lead, I don't know the ramifications or next steps, and I'm sort of too afraid to ask but I need to talk to actual people who have been in a similar situation to see how they handled it and what effect it had on them. If you've never been in this situation, take this as a warning to take the highest precautions...if your house is old, ASSUME there is lead regardless of anything else, get a pro to at least verify safety, take the training classes for renovators, get the proper PPE, or don't do it. Obviously, hindsight is 20/20. I took the precautions I knew to do, but found out there was more to it after the fact. I thought I was doing enough.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon't make fun of me, be condescending, or tell me I'm an idiot. I already feel terrible. I'm extremely broken-up over this, had thoughts of s\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*e (called a hotline already), so don't tell me it's ok if it's not, but I need positive, constructive input only.  \n\n\nI was removing the waterproofing on a section of my basement wall so I could apply mortar where it had dissolved and apply a new coat of waterproofing. It was a 33' long wall and I went maybe 3'-4' up it, but only removed the loose paint, so although the total area was \\~130 sqft, I removed less than that actual amount of paint.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI removed it by tapping the bubbled-up portions with a hammer, scraping them away, and then using a wire brush on a drill to remove the more difficult spots. I was using a normal shop-vac to collect the scraps and dust, and had been putting the excess in a thick black trash bag because I know that paint shouldn't go in the regular trash. I wore PPE - tyvek suit, nitrile gloves under work gloves, and a 3M respirator - and took a full shower after both \"sessions\" of work. The respirator filters were NOT the NIOSH ones for asbestos and lead, because I thought I was just going to be removing waterproofer, which was filtered by the standard ones. I should have wrapped the furnace but assumed I was far enough away from it.  \n\n\nI started on a new section, around a corner from the wall I was working on and noticed the paint felt different. It peeled off in big chunks, so I suspected it might be lead, and I left that alone, but went to work in a different spot where the paint didn't have that characteristic.  \n\n\nI got a pack of 2 lead tests from Home Depot and tested the walls. The one where I suspected lead, the test turned deep red. Where I tested on the \"normal\" wall, it turned pink, which would seem to indicate lead present in a smaller amount. Then again, that's just two spots. I'm concerned especially with the \"normal\" wall that I may have coincidentally tested a spot with low lead, and the rest of the wall could be loaded with it. I could buy pack after pack of tests from HD but it wouldn't solve the problem.  \n\n\nI've abandoned the project for now but I can't just leave it indefinitely as it is.  \n\n\nStuff I've read online about lead in homes is really bad, like if you test sufficiently positive for lead with a blood test or if you have someone inspect and they find it, the EPA can force you to have an abatement whether you can afford to or not. If you can't afford it, they will just seize your house and force you to declare bankruptcy on it. Obviously, avoiding a test and potentially living in Lead Chernobyl in fear of this is counter-productive. I did some research on community resources, because my city is almost entirely built during the height of the \"lead paint\" era, and found that we don't qualify for abatement assistance because we make slightly too much money (literally $4k a year too much) and don't have a kid. Other sources said the city is having a hard time even helping the people who qualified due to lack of participating contractors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI haven't slept for 2 days and have quite honestly wanted to straight-up drop dead at times (I called a hotline last night bc of thoughts I've had. I'm not currently in any danger) because of the potential hardship I just opened us up to, which is 1000x worse than the original problem. I feel stupid and irresponsible, and basically too much of a fool to continue living. If it were just me affected, I could say \"sucks to suck, loser\" and just accept my consequences.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand, my husband and the guy on the hotline (not a pro but talked about his own diy experiences) acted like it wasn't a big deal...like it *would have* been, if I'd done the whole basement, up and down every wall, not worn any PPE at all, etc. and people all over the city are doing DIY renovations equally old houses. They both seemed to think the amount that could have reached the furnace AND was small enought to pass through the furnace filter is small, and if I just don't tear up ANY more paint, fill the exposed joints with mortar, paint over everything, and get the ducts cleaned by a place that uses HEPA vacs, it should be ok. Homeowner advisory videos from the city and state government show the biggest lead threats being lead paint in the actual living space, on doors, frames, windowsills, porches, and advise painting over the lead paint, regular cleaning with a wet mop/rag and sweeping with a HEPA vac, and eat calcium and vit C foods to reduce the amount of lead in the body. That contradicts what I read about people having their homes seized by the EPA, because it's like \"If there's lead in your home and you can't move or abate, just live around it the best you can by taking precautions\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my old neighborhood of brownstone-type houses, you could walk down the street in the summer and there would be people diy gutting the old houses in normal clothes, drinking beers or whatnot as they did, and you could see from what was being done that they were tearing out victorian-age stuff, so clearly I'm not the only person to have made this mistake and my house isn't the only one to have ignorant diy, so how do they deal with it? What is the effect?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got a lead blood test this morning and am waiting for the results. If they're high or low, I don't know what I should do either way. I don't want to touch more lead and find out. I requested some quotes on lead testing from local contractors. Being that it's a weekend, they will take some time to get back.  \n\n\nLast year, I got a quote on basement waterproofing (sump, vapor barrier, drainage system) and ended up not following through because, while I \"kinda\" could afford the financing payment, I decided against taking on any more debt. I might contact them to do the job and bite the financial bullet once the proverbial pieces fall and I have a better idea what's going on.",

    "text": "Carpeted room with generations of animal messes\n\n130 year old Queen Anne, with an addition shoved on over the dining room sometime later. Only room in the house that\u2019s not tile or hardwood. Carpet circa 1980s or early 1990s. Bathroom for god only knows how many dogs and cats through the years.  And maybe kids, too \u2014 I think it was originally built as a nursery or play room as it can only be accessed through a bedroom.  The whole room aside from the floor and doors is a sort of sadist level slap brush finish - heavy and sharp, more than 1/4 inch deep in places, and it\u2019s all white. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s even been painted or primed. Probably at least primed, water doesn\u2019t soak straight in if I splash a bit on. \n\nAt any rate, 30+ years of pet messes soaking into the floor. Didn\u2019t notice any smell when I moved there in 2009, but it had been repurposed as a laundry room (small closet beneath the attic stairs, just tall enough for a stacked washer and dryer, backing up to the upstairs bathroom so plumbing was handy), and at least 6-8 years of detergent and fabric softener spills pretty well overpowered it all, at least til we had to move the laundry stuff out (couldn\u2019t find modern stacking machines short enough to fit) and decided to finally rip out the carpet and put down something else.\n\nOnce the carpet was disturbed, it was no longer just an olfactory feast for animals. The stench became thick enough to cut with a knife, if you used a non-ferrous one so it wouldn\u2019t rust (our carpet knife did). Even with a window open (one of only two in the house that have screens), an ion generating Hepa filter, even putting my ozone generator (I have rental \nproperty and it\u2019s occasionally called for), the reek remained. It was bad enough that we sealed off the room in late spring when it started to get  hot, and just now got back to it. \n\nI took inspiration from movies and tv shows with morgues, and rubbed some perfume oil (spice bomb clone from Kingsley oils, good stuff - basically just smells like a room full of baking spices) under my nose, and that wiped out the stench, added some work gloves after discovering the carpet was literally sticky, and got all the carpet and the disintegrating padding shoved out the window (no carrying through the house and easy access to the bin)\u2026 and that\u2019s where I am now. \n\nStuff under the padding appears to be 1/4 inch hardboard, with gaps between boards. Under that is something that looks like rough planks over joists, a few gaps in the half inch range visible. \n\nThe stench isn\u2019t nearly so palpable, but it\u2019s there. \n\nMy wife wants to use the room as a wardrobe or walk in closet or whatever term you wish.  Fine by me - my office is the laundry room now, but it the machines are in a closet, I put up a small on the wall shelf next to it, switched us to super concentrated detergent and softener that fit in it - doesn\u2019t really take up any space,  so I don\u2019t need to move my office.  Essentially, I\u2019m saying I don\u2019t really care how the room looks when I\u2019m done with it as long as it\u2019s OK at first glance. \n\nSo: here\u2019s my plan and I\u2019m seeking feedback and an answer to an important safety question. \n\nAn enzyme cleaner sprayed onto the floor and at least a couple feet up the walls. Applied twice over 12 or so hours.\n\nWait a day or so for it to do its work and dry out\n\nZinsser BIN primer applied with a paint sprayer, completely covering the floor and probably the baseboards, too.  Two coats at appropriate intervals. If it oversprays to the walls, I don\u2019t really care. If the difference is too glaring I can always paint it, the room is only 11.5x11.5. \n\nMaybe a coat of paint to keep the primer from being scuffed up\n\nSome kind of flooring - we\u2019re still deciding between  sheet vinyl flooring and laminate. It\u2019s be hard to match the quality of wood in the rest of the house, and I\u2019m not screwing with tile again for the rest of my life if I can manage it. As long as it keeps the BIN from getting damaged and releasing the stench, I\u2019ll be happy enough. \n\nSimple enough plan?  Will it do the job?\n\nBIN is nasty stuff, I know. I\u2019ll have 2 out of 3 windows open. \n\nThird one has a window AC, I plan to cover it with plastic drop cloth and tape it to the window frame.  Sandwich bags and tape over the door hardware, glass covered with tape and plastic. Cast iron vent cover at floor level, I\u2019ll try to remove and just cover the vent, or plastic and tape for that, too. \n\nHooded coverall, gloves, goggles.\n\nHere\u2019s the safety bit \u2014 I have a p100 ventilator but no VOC filters. Couldn\u2019t find the right kind in stores. Picked up a 3m P95 mask that says it\u2019s for nuisance VOC. \nIs it safe to use either of those,  or should I order VOC filters for the ventilator?  (It\u2019s a slim fit thing, I got it when I was scraping down efflorescence  on the basement walls. Standard canister stuff doesn\u2019t fit it). That\u2019ll take a few days if I do.\n\nAny additional suggestions, cautions, advice, etc? \n\nThank you very much for making it through my long winded posting.",

    "text": "Attic Sealing Advice (Pictures Inside)\n\n**Location**: St Catherines (close to Toronto, US NY border), Ontario, Canada  \n**Home**: Built in 1970s, two storey home  \nI plan on air sealing my attic over the winter, or perhaps in the spring. Before I go and do so, I want to be as prepared as possible as I want to do this right the first time, and never have to crawl back up there again as it looks miserable. I will then either blow in insulation myself or have a company do it. But I want to get the air sealing out of the way first.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n**Pictures of my attic: https://imgur.com/a/mZYAd**  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n**Plan &amp; Inventory**  \nI do not have any bathroom fans, minimal ducting going up through there, no recessed lights (at least I think, I have old fixtures that hang down from the ceiling), and some other vents. I plan on using foam to seal around all of these, and the top of wall plates. I will be installing baffles and plugging the ends of the ceiling joists with fiberglass batts where the soffit vents are.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n**Maneuvering**  \nAs you can see, my current attic has about a foot or so of blown insulation. With the way everything is up there, I understand I will move insulation out of the way, do my work, then put back the insulation and continue this for the entire attic. My question is, (q1) how the hell do I move around here? It doesn't look like there is room to stand or to kneel even. Am I going to be doing this on my knees?  \n--edit  \nA question I forgot to ask is, what is under the current blown in insulation? Is it just drywall? If so, how the hell do I get around without falling through?  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n**Materials**  \n(q2)Should I use fire rated spray foam or will normal spray foam (in a can, I will use a spray can gun) be sufficient? (q3)Any other materials I will need? I plan on running baffles and using fiberglass batts to plug before the soffit vents. (q4)Should I consider caulk or other kinds of sealing products?  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n**Safety and Surprises**  \nI will be using a full face mask that has vapor and particle filtration (the 3M ones). On top of that I will be using a full suit and gloves. (q5)What else should I consider for my safety? (q6)Do I run the risk of my face mask constantly fogging in the winter, and it'd be suggested I do this in the spring instead? I cannot afford to get any dust or particles in my eyes due to an eye condition.  \n**Surprises**: (q7)What are some common surprises I can find up there, aside from animal poop and shady electrical? Is there anything I should look out for?  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nThese seem to be all the questions I have for now. If you guys have any suggestions for what else I should do, or how I should do this, please suggest them here, or if I'm missing/forgetting something. I want to do a thorough job.",

    "text": "Leveling and resurfacing garage floor (DIY project update)\n\nHi all,\n\nA few weeks back I posted about the really rough concrete slab we have in the lower level/crawlspace of our 1920's house in the SF Bay Area. Fixing this was not a critical structural issue but it was a bit of an eyesore and meant that we could never really get the garage floor clean. The aggregate was exposed and it was constantly dusty/chipping even more. On top of that, the slab was roughly 3-4\" out of level from one side to the other as a result of foundation settling (the foundation had already been repaired by a previous owner).\n\nI wound up making things look a whole lot better using a combination of Rapid Set mortar mix and Rapid Set concrete leveler. The mortar mix was less than 1/2 the price of the concrete leveler, so I used it for the bulk of the job (30 bags) while applying a thin (1/4-1/2\") layer of concrete leveler at the end (7 bags total). It was a fair amount of hard and dirty work (2 full weekends) but I am very happy with the end result. We'll see how it stands up over the coming years, but it was certainly much more economical than tearing out the slab and re-pouring it.\n\nBefore/after photos on Imgur: [https://imgur.com/a/kyRF5at](https://imgur.com/a/kyRF5at)\n\nOverall area was about 200 sq ft.\n\nI wasn't sure exactly which products to use at the start but I came up with the grand idea of e-mailing Rapid Set's customer support to ask for help. They replied within a day to all my questions and advised me to go the route I described above. I was really pleased with their response and happy with how the products performed. I hadn't done a ton of work with concrete before but with enough patience I would say this is within reach of any determined DIY homeowner.\n\nHope this helps anyone out there considering doing something similar.\n\n**Materials and costs:**\n\n30 bags of [Rapid Set mortar mix](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Rapid-Set-55-lbs-Mortar-Mix-04010055/202188453) \\+ 7 bags of [Rapid Set concrete leveler](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Rapid-Set-50-lb-CTS-Concrete-Leveler-186010050/204414391) \\~= $700\n\nConcrete leveler primer \\~= $24\n\n36 pouches of [\"set control\" concrete retarder](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Rapid-Set-0-88-oz-Concrete-Pharmacy-Set-Control-80100000/202188468) to slow the hardening of the mortar mix and leveler \\~= $100. I was originally planning on paying a day laborer just to mix for me as I poured but with the retarder I was able to mix and pour one bag at a time on my own.\n\n[Electric concrete mixer](https://www.amazon.com/Electric-Handheld-Concrete-Portable-Adjustment/dp/B08G8HT4W9/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&amp;keywords=mortar+mixer+drill&amp;qid=1626205320&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExR1Q3TU1WOEtWQUVXJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwODA5MTgxMVpaRjNGUThDNklBWSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNTg0ODkxM0tRNUFENzBETkxJNSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=) \\- $75 - This was a lifesaver after I burned out one corded drill early on. Totally worth the expense for this project\n\n[Spiked roller](https://www.amazon.com/Navegando-Roller-Spiked-Screeding-Compound/dp/B07CSHPYF7/ref=sr_1_9?crid=1HXWB4Z60NBGM&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=spiked+roller+for+self+leveling+concrete&amp;qid=1626205387&amp;sprefix=spiked+roller%2Caps%2C227&amp;sr=8-9) \\- $38 + $10 for a wooden handle - Made the end result so much cleaner as it completely blended out the difference between each bag of self leveling concrete.\n\nMaybe another $100 in incidental expenses (buckets, tarps, etc, etc)\n\n**Total: About $1100 and maybe 30 hrs of my labor**",

Edit: the 2x4s are approximately 16\"oc, and are themselves on top of 4x4s approximately 24\"oc. The 4x4s make direct contact with the asphalt underneath.\n\nIt almost looks like a modular or prefab shed, except it has two garage doors/openers and has a diamond tread plate lip at the entrance. It's approximately 30'x25'.\n\n\nMy question, as a person who has only ever parked a car in a garage with a poured concrete floor:\n\nIs it safe to park inside what was clearly meant to be a garage, even with the wooden floors? \n\n\nI've checked out a few prefab garage websites that seem to offer garages with wooden floors and they tell you to install on a poured concrete or crushed stone slab, and while this house appears to have a suitable base, I'm uneasy about driving a car over plywood.\n\nAny insight would help! \n\n(Location is near Philadelphia, not sure if the climate and ground conditions affects site prep for something like this).",

    "text": "The self leveler doesn't really self-level. I would say it self-puddles. If you pour a 5 gallon bucket on the floor, it will make a big (2-3' diameter) puddle within a minute or so. You can mix it thinner if you want to make it flow more, but like all concrete that comes at the expense of strength in the finished product. I used a large squeegee to move it around and a spiked roller to feather the edges between pours. It's still not super level, but you wouldn't notice unless you got down there with a level or straightedge to measure.\n\nI actually mixed a couple buckets on the thicker side so I could get the self leveler to stick on a slope at the transition to the main slab and then leading out to the driveway. I finished these with a trowel to get them mostly flat and then the compound flowed out enough that the trowel marks mostly disappeared without all the compound sliding down the slope. I wouldn't do a large area like that since it took a lot more babysitting than the flat areas, but it definitely worked. I did have a tarp and border on the driveway edge so stop any compound from seeping beyond. As it hardened, I cleaned up some of the excess with a sponge and troweled the edge to keep it looking neat and clean.",

I have a dirt floor crawl space under my house. It's probably a good 4.5' high so while not a full basement definitely big enough to use for storage, however right now its' dirt and kinda nasty down there.\n\nI'm looking at either adding a concrete floor which I just got a quote for $9,000 or adding a plastic vapor barrier which I havn't had quoted but I'm guessing will come in at a couple thousand.\n\nI'm wondering if either of these options are worth it.  I doubt Im going to add value to the home so it would  more be for my use. I've recently downsized my home and have very little storage space so could definitely utilize the storage space and would prefer it be a cleaner environment down there if I'm going to store stuff there. \n\nI'm a bit put off by the high cost of adding a concrete floor so a vapor barrier seems like a cheaper alternative to the concrete, but have heard that's kind of a half ass way of doing it and not worth it.\n\nLooking for any insights or opinions or suggestions?",

Still looks great three years later -- as promised the portion along the strip exterior to the garage door has not  yellowed at all in the sun -- we were told this was one of the advantages of polyurea versus epoxy.\n\nThe one thing I would have done different is be very insistent about aggressive application of grit for traction.  The company we had do the install came out a year after the initial install to apply much more grit (on their dime) due to how slippery the surface was when wet (a big issue if you live somewhere with snow).\n\nI've come to realize I got a very very good deal -- $1700 for a 2-1/2 car garage in early 2018.  My father had the same company (franchised I believe, in a different state) do the same work on a floor in better condition than mine for $2500 for a 2 car garage in late 2019 (or maybe very early 2020?).",

    "text": "Installing wood floor over concrete garage floor as I convert it to living space.\n\nI am installing a hardwood oak floor over my garage floor.\n\nI have done this in a portion of the garage already to create a bedroom it worked well and has held up well. Now I am doing it in a space that will be a bonus/game room. This part has a more sloped grade. it's small but noticeable where the floor meets the stem wall.\n\nMy process for doing the bedroom went as follows:\n\n* vapor barrier directly on the concrete.\n* 2 inch foam insulation boards over the vapor barrier\n* 3/4 OSB over the insulation boards\n* Concrete anchors through everything into the garage floor\n* Wood on top of the OSB\n\nLike I said this has held up well for about a year in the bedroom area.\n\nAs I move on to the game room area and deal with this grade, I used wood ribs to create a leveling framework. between the vapor barrier and OSB. In some areas I have some flexing of the OSB. In the bedroom area this wasn't a problem as the grade was so minimal that I just laid everything directly on the garage floor. But in the game room area it isn't directly on the concrete. So when I step on the OSB subfloor in some areas it does give a little. My leveling framework is spaced every 24 inches apart.\n\nMy question is can I have any flexing at all? In some areas where it was more noticeable I actually drilled a small hole in the OSB and sprayed expanding foam in and after it dried it was much improved to the point where I didn't notice any flexing. But my neighbor says it's flexing too much.\n\nNeed some help here.\n\nTIA, y'all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

    "text": "Most of this advice seems very bad. You probably do not want some non-slip additive added to your top coat. That's not generally considered the proper way to epoxy a floor.\n\nLook, epoxy by itself is slick as glass. If it gets wet, you WILL fall down. But that's what the paint chips are for. If you've ever seen epoxy floors, then you've seen that they have a coat that is just paint chips. Those chips aren't just for the pretty colors -- they provide texture. That texture is what keeps the floor from becoming slippery.\n\nA good installer is constantly aware of how rough the texture is. They know that if they scrape the paint chips too much, there won't be enough texture and the floor will be too slippery. They know that the top coat of glassy poly epoxy needs to be extra thin. If it's too thick, again, you lose the texture of the paint chips and will fall down when it's wet.\n\nBasic epoxy floor installation goes like this:\n\n1. Grind imperfections off the concrete\n2. Acid wash then power wash the concrete (to etch it so the epoxy will stick)\n3. Once that's fully dry (1-7 days later, depending on the climate) Primer coat of epoxy (clear). From here on out the timing becomes very important. If you wait too long between coats you will no longer get the chemical bonds necessary for a quality floor, and the layers will peel\n4. 12-24 hours later, Base coat of epoxy (tinted color of your choice) immediately sprinkled with paint chips (size and color of your choosing)\n5. 12-24 hours later, lightly scrape the paint chips to ensure no sharp edges sticking up, blow out the floor to remove the loose paint chips, then a Top coat of UV-protectant epoxy (clear). You want this coat to be thin and the floor to be far rougher than you'd expect, because this texture is what's keeping you from falling down when it's wet.\n6. 12-24 hours later, *extremely* thin second coat of the top coat poly epoxy (optional, depends on if the texture is already good or you want it a hair smoother -- but be careful not to make it too smooth!)\n7. Can be walked on in 24-48 hours, can have things put back on it in 5-7 days",

I had a professional expos floor installed with chips and while it isn't grippy like textured concrete, I'd say it has more grip than the polished concrete that was there before.

    "text": "Brand new home has many cracks in the garage floor. How bad are they? Anyone with concrete experience?\n\nPictures:  [https://imgur.com/a/fh53Kr0](https://imgur.com/a/fh53Kr0) \n\n \n\nJust purchased a brand new home 2 months ago and it came with these cracks in the garage. During our initial walk-thru the construction manager told me they are just normal drying cracks and don't worry about them. I didn't believe him and they've since grown in size slightly and I don't believe they're just \"normal\". After many attempts to contact warranty, they're finally sending someone out to look at them and I'm sure I'll have an uphill battle trying to get them to do anything for me. \n\nI was told the 'dime test' is a common way to discern if they're serious or not, but I know nothing more about concrete. Can anyone with experience tell me if these are normal or not? I can use all the knowledge/fire power I can get to fight warranty on this. Thanks!",

But that doesn't really matter.  If you've only owned the home for 2 months you should still be under some kind of warranty.  Most developers and contractors here warranty garage slabs and sidewalks for a year+.  Check your paperwork and see what you actually have in the way of leverage, and then tell them you want it redone.  I would do it asap.  Just a heads up though, they'll have to remove it all, re-compact it, and re-pour it, and then I might crack all over again.",

    "text": "Garage shelving solution - untreated 2x4 contact with concrete floor\n\nI\u2019m planning on adding some shelving in my garage on the side that goes over where the garbage and recycling cans currently live. Basically, this design: https://youtu.be/cTxRBckenI4\n\nI know that untreated wood coming into contact with concrete is begging for rot, so I\u2019d like to avoid that. At the same time, I don\u2019t want PT permanently affixed to the wall as I can\u2019t stand the smell of it and I\u2019d rather not contain the off gases like that in such a confined space.\n\nThe options I\u2019ve kicked around are:\n\n1. Get some PT paint and paint just the end surface that contacts the concrete floor to minimize the smell and off gassing issue\n2. Cut pieces of old tarps and wrap around the base of the 2x4 that contacts the floor, stapling them in place\n3. Apply waterproof tape to the base of the 2x4s to create a barrier\n\nTemperatures vary wildly up here in Northern Alberta. In the winter, -40F/c is not uncommon. In summer, we have quite a few days above 86F/30c. Most of the time, it\u2019s a very dry climate, basically a cold desert. At the same time, I don\u2019t want to invite/trap condensation and have to redo this in a year.\n\nAny thoughts on how to best provide a barrier between the raw lumber and the concrete garage floor?",

    "text": "&gt; We have a garage floor we DIYed 3ish years ago with an epoxy flooring kit (don't quite remember which one but it wasn't a well known brand).\n\nThe best way to at least start with this would be to figure out what you used originally. Go to the store(s) you think you bought it from and look at names, logos, etc of similar products. If that doesn't ring any bells, try using archive.org to view websites of the retailer and other similar businesses from the year you bought it.\n\nIf you find it, there is a very non-zero chance the company provides instructions for adding additional coats. You then purchase the same stuff and apply as they say.\n\nIf you are set on using a newer / better / name brand coating, at least get the type of product and any other info you can from the first company. Then take that to the 2nd company and explain what you have. Straight hand knowledge and info from the people that make and use the stuff is 100x better than online forum advice. (Yes, the irony of this is not lost on me.)\n\nSome non-expert, random ass guessing for your specific problem: If the grooves are small and shallow, I wonder if caulking them with some shitty acrylic caulk before doing the epoxy, and pulling it up while it's still wet would do the trick? Or tape off the entire drainage portion and do it by hand? You obviously just want to prevent damming or otherwise filling in the channels that water is supposed to go through.",

You need mass (heavy things) for low frequency sounds. De-coupling layers like mounting drywall on resilient channel also helps enormously. For example, tear down the existing drywall, airseal all penetrations like around electrical boxes, hang a sheet of mass-loaded vinyl, mount resilient channel to the studs, then hang double drywall over it.",

    "text": "DIY Basement Renovation\n\nA few years ago, I renovated two stories of a house in Catalunya, Spain. My [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/ond4c7/i_renovated_an_abandoned_house_in_catalunya_my/) about this project proved popular so I thought I would give an update to further work on this house.\n\nI did not do much to the basement. I was glad to be done building work, so I used it for general storage and just got on with my life. A few years later, I find myself with ten weeks of 'free' time, so I decided to renovate the basement into a small guest apartment.\n\nThe work required the demolition of a section of wall, the pouring of approximately 10 tons of concrete for a new slab, and the building of a new bathroom, bedroom and living room.\n\n**The over-all project**\n\nThe apartment is approx 35sqm (380sqft) and I spent about \u00a310k (\u20ac12k / $12.5k). All in, it was quite a low-cost renovation considering the feature set, custom doors and material quality\n\n[The basement, just after starting demolition.](https://preview.redd.it/i2tssyzkybxd1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01860c6dad6c00e62d314be75484c3b086c3ac4d)\n\nA key problem I faced was that it was not possible to deliver materials to the front of the house. In the end, I figured that the easiest way to get the 8 tons of dry concrete mix into the basement would be to poke it through the wall with a stick.\n\n[Posting 8 tons of gravel\\/sand mix through a pipe takes some time.](https://preview.redd.it/aztmr5nebcxd1.png?width=2832&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c23ab2f92f33c263148348581e42e555254af1a)\n\nEvery morning, I just cracked out a podcast and shovelled and poked for an hour or so. To do the concrete slab for the outside area and the internal floor took about 10 days. This was really tiring and I *had* to take a couple of days off to recover afterwards.\n\n[80&amp;#37; done with pouring the new slab](https://preview.redd.it/cayi5hrpybxd1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4778a80e13f23a5341d88cab8ddd38f42a139198)\n\nBelow is a picture of the underfloor heating being installed (electric) and also of the rather nice view the room looks out on.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nhouanzlbcxd1.png?width=2840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39c4fe258db03142b519d0ea2968a3d6020bea4b\n\nWhat made this project *much* faster to complete is that I was tacking the build on to all the pre-existing systems. The HVAC system had enough ports to cover the basement rooms, I separated my MCU by floor - so working without affecting the rest of the house was easy - and it was relatively easy to extend my water system from the upper floors (there were only a few things I could have better thought ahead for in my first build).\n\n[Dry-wall, conduit and radiators installed.](https://preview.redd.it/c0mkop4izbxd1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=117900756d14b9ce403d7d1348710b9923972250)\n\nI installed a false ceiling using thin batons and cladding. This was pretty tedious to do, but it allowed me to hide the HVAC pipes and other conduit. Luckily the beams were deep enough for the final result to still look good (i.e. enough depth on the remaining visible beam).\n\n[Installing false ceiling.](https://preview.redd.it/1x04xmkkacxd1.png?width=2434&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=301ebb2ecb6c9b1dfd02965d4834a8cc79e6fe46)\n\n**The Bathroom**\n\nThe bathroom is fairly compact, but more than enough for a guest apartment. I built the sink unit around an idea draw unit (using some kitchen top off-cuts I had from a van conversion). The backsplash is pine cladding with Rustoleum midnight blue chalk paint. It is a great colour.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bb4m9vynacxd1.png?width=2854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6f61163b760f79ea783145a6ef6e2644c838810\n\nThe macerator pump sits behind the toilet (on the other side of the wall - contrary to installation instructions) but it is very easily accessible with the space under the stairs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lbuxzt6qacxd1.png?width=2840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e3c55828bdcd5d56c56340a38fae05b72b24c3c\n\nAs the basement is below the height of the main sewer outlet, I had to put it all through a macerator pump. Largely, this has been fine and is not very noisy.\n\n**The Bedroom**\n\nThe bedroom, is 3.5 x 3m so it is a snug room (work with what you got) but it makes a pretty fine double room for guests. I put a big reclaimed window in for light - this takes up the entire room width - and with the large window in the living room it works pretty well. Unfortunately, there is no way to put a window in any of the bedroom walls as they either face underneath the barn (behind the headboard) or into a room under the balcony (left).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hr41fw8sacxd1.png?width=2876&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cfdfc155eb64e235c5c8d846160fea55b467c4e\n\nBelow you can see the window, the right hand side opens if required.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/81velfdm3cxd1.png?width=2860&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8bbb86a1daa1feff3021c58759c394d8f4229eb\n\n**Outside/Patio area**  \nBefore, the outside area was a few steps of endlessly crumbly dusty concrete.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9k9622g03cxd1.png?width=2684&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e1e5b5ef8ee4c996eaaa31df74e5eeede22596c\n\nAfter, the patio is a nice place to have a coffee in the morning. It also ties the single bedroom in the balcony (door on left) with the rest of the house). I also fitted a new front door (the old one was very, very, draughty).\n\n[I used a bit of an old 1000l wine barrel to make the wooden step surface. The tiles match the balcony on the 1st floor.](https://preview.redd.it/i0tzxmcw2cxd1.png?width=2658&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca90aeb9b2fc97e9651eaa9f43f444874e051fa4)\n\n**The Store Room**\n\nNothing very clever here - it is a store room. However, I did not plaster in the dry-wall (I just painted it) so that if I wanted I could install a small kitchen here and turn the entire floor into a self-contained apartment. This would simply mean unscrewing a few dry-wall panels, connect waste plumbing (this runs through here from the upstairs kitchen anyway). Then, run a couple of cables for the hob, and put in some kitchen furniture, and it is good to go. It is not in my 'life plan' to rent parts of the house out - but having the option to do so seems sensible!\n\n[An exciting store room.](https://preview.redd.it/z2p4sfr24cxd1.png?width=2818&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc3609aca4578ca6dc5986d62891d19cecf6b0e5)\n\nI have published a [short video about the entire process here](https://youtu.be/EzbD5wh-UfU?si=IrHgQtsD67Jzf3f7) (sorry if you hate drum &amp; base, it just works so well with this sort of film!).\n\n**Key lessons**\n\n* There is not much flexibility with the macerator pump installation instructions in terms of 'fall' from the bath/shower. I trimmed an inch off it to keep the bath head space, the last bit drains very slowly now. If it gets too annoying I can put the pump an inch lower.\n* Underfloor heating makes getting big tiles flat. Just a pain in the ass.\n* Tile wedge system (first time I used it) is pretty good, but the 0.5mm spacers are quite fragile so better 1mm or up.\n* I hate machine-cutting large hard ceramic tiles.\n* Installing HVAC in the first build was really worth it.\n* Nail Gun (electric dwalt brad nailer) worth its weight in gold. Simiarly, an oscillating saw saves a lot of time - especially when it comes to 'fine tuning' dry-wall.\n* Laser Level - I did not have one for my previous build (plumb line) - but it makes life a hell of a lot easier. Worth the $$$.\n* And, the best bit about building work is when you get to stop!\n\nHappy to answer any questions!",

    "text": "Best Buffing Method Between Topcots: scotch-brite pads, sandpaper backed by sanding block, or superfine sanding sponge?\n\nHey everyone, I've received a lot of great support from this /reddit so I have been able to narrow down my choices for best way to buff in between coats. I will be using a water based polyurethane on a large beech tabletop. I've already ruled out using my random orbital sander between coats, but I'm not sure which other option is best. My choices are:\n\n1. scotch-brite pads\n\n2. plain old sandpaper backed by sanding block\n\n3. superfine sanding sponge\n\nWhich one would you recommend?",

    "text": "Buffing is equivalent to a phase called \"rubbing out.\" This is done after the final coat is on and is has cured for as long as you can afford to let it cure. Steel wool is absolutely the wrong answer for waterbased finishes. Don't do that. The manufacturers explicitly tell you not to do that. I'll tell you something the people at Minwax told me. There are two kinds of finishes. One type (for lack of a better word) \"melts\" the previously layer and bonds to it. The second type needs the previous coat to be roughed up because it bonds to that.  Polycrylic is the roughed up type. Each layer is separate and if you sand hard enough you will eventually expose witness lines. These are like looking at a topographic map and are actually the lines formed as you sand through the individual layers. Other finishes, like polyurethanes, are the \"melting\" type and the solvents cause them to bond to previous layers. Those type are the most forgiving but have some drawbacks in terms of odor, cleanup, yellow tint, etc. Again, that info is straight from a telephone conversation I had with Minwax a bunch of years ago.  I build stuff I have been selling via the internet for about 15 years now (it's a hobby). I pretty much topcoat something every day of the week. Tonight I topcoated 10 surfaces (just for example's sake, let's say they are 24x24 inch Go boards).  Four were polycrylic and the other six were my favorite product, Minwax oil-modified waterbased polyurethane (only available at Lowe's).  This stuff has the odor and ease of use of polycrylic and the adhesion properties of polyurethane. I highly recommend it, though it will make whites yellow and blues slightly green. So, in a nutshell, here's my process on my \"Go\" boards. I put down about eight coats of the waterbased, oil-modified polyu, sanding very lightly between coats with 220 grit sandpaper to knock down the dust nibs and take out any bubbles. Before the final coat, I'll used a 400 grit Abranet disk on my random orbit sander and do a good leveling of the surface. I want it dull with no hills and valleys. Then I'll put on the final coat and maybe one more after that if it looks like it might need it. I then let it cure for a couple days. The rubbing out involves using the random orbit sander and  220 grit again to flatten, then 400 grit Abranet, then a 600 grit Abranet. Probably about 10 minutes sanding with each. Then I switch to a 1000 grit Abralon pad on the RO sander for about 15 minutes. Then a 2000 grit Abralon pad for 15 minutes and then a 4000 grit Abralon for 15 more. If you're not lazy and in a hurry you're not going to have any swirl marks or any marks at all from the RO sander. Usually 4000 grit is enough, but I sometimes will then go to a finer liquid grit compound (the darker the finish, the better it will look using even higher grits). Finally wax with a wax that is high in carnauba. I like Mother's myself and have been using it for 15 years. One of the benefits of the Abranet/Abralon pads is that wet sanding is unnecessary. Recently I was at my local Woodcraft store and they were doing a Saturday morning demo on the Abralon pads and a couple of people watching were amazed at the quality of a finish that they give dry. I know that this is long and tedious. I'm giving you 15 years of personal experience. And I'm relating what the maker of topcoating products puts on their cans and told me personally.",

Once you have the fix figured out (and it will probably just be a scotch bright pad and certainly not rubbing compound or chrome polish, etc. which will all just make it smoother and shinier--like a chrome bumper) try it on your visible damage.  \n\nAs for any coated finish, anything that has already been scratched through a coat (poly or something like a clearcoat) is not going to fixed by more rubbing, only through an application of another clearcoat--probably on the entire refrigerator--which I (and probably you) are not up to.

Some have said to use water and baking soda and a toothbrush? Others say use the same thing, but either a ScotchBrite pad or 000 steel wool. Others say soak them in vinegar and then clean it off with WD40 and then use wax of some sort (car wax is what I've seen repeatedly) when I'm done cleaning. \n\nI've cleaned a couple of old knives before with the baking soda/water/toothbrush combo before, and it seemed effective but that was for a knife with just little rust spots here and there. So I'm kind of scratching my head at this point with what to do. I'm leaning towards the vinegar soak, but I'm not sure how the tools I have with a wood handle would hold up to that and then what do I do after that? Use an oil or WD40 and then wax? I feel so lost.\n\nSorry if this is in the wrong place or questions like this have been answered before. Thank you!",

That being said, I need some help rectifying the situation.\n\nFiance and I decided to lay tile down in our living room. Everything is great except we mistakenly let the grout dry on the textured tile. We tried just about everything we can think of to remove it. We understand it will be physical, but we're hoping someone may have an idea to help make it a bit easier though.\n\nWe tried water, scrapper, miracle sealants heavy duty acidic cleaner and their neutrilzer /cleaner. We tried straight vinegar as well and scotch brite. A 80 grit nylon cup brush kind of worked, but would take 5 minutes a tile. A steel brush didn't work well either (tested on spare tile). A wire hand brush worked okay (didn't scratch) but would take absolutely forever.\n\nCan anyone help us?\n\nThe picture here shows part of the floor. The haze comes off, but you can see the spots of grout stuck. \n\n[Floor](https://i.vgy.me/smvIY1.jpg)\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\n\nUpdate 1: rented a floor polisher last night. Used a red pad with vinegar. Wasn't working well enough for me so I switched to a black pad and diluted (probably too much) muriatic acid. This seemed to help. I used the buffer for probably 4-6 hours. Woke up this morning and it appears to have taken off all the excess grout on the surface. It missed a lot in the texture. It also stained my grout black and red and left a pretty bad haze on the tiles.\n\nI think my next steps are to remove the haze, then scrub the grout, and see what it looks like from there. If we can get everything off except in the texture, then we're considering putting some wet-look on the tile. Obviously not a fix, but I think it would be a good work around.\n\n[Floor update ](https://i.vgy.me/eZ2vtX.jpg)\n\n[Floor update 2 ](https://i.vgy.me/kahDU5.jpg)\n\n[Floor update 3 ](https://i.vgy.me/8chMrB.jpg)\n\n\n\nUpdate 2:[Floor haze gone](https://i.vgy.me/d5wWBV.jpg)\n\nThink I'm going to try [This product ](https://i.vgy.me/h4newn.png) or something similar to give my tiles the \"wet look\" it will hide the grout in the texture, if all goes well. \n\nWiped the haze off the tile.",

    "text": "Easiest way to remove latex paint from oil doors\n\nIn my 90s colonial, the last owner repainted all the doors with latex directly over the original oil paint finish. I can scrape sections off with my fingernail. I stripped one but it was a lot of work because I just used goof-off and a rough scotch brite paint removal pad. Can someone recommend a better product to loosen the latex without disturbing the oil paint which is still in great condition? They are 6 panel doors with a wood grain, so a plastic putty knife didn't work so well either.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/MH7488R",

The water didn't come back whereas previously it was always coming back, and there were normal sounds of draining.\n\nSo then I put the p-trap back and ran the faucet but it was still clogged.\n\nThe power vee I have is a 25 footer, and I cannot tell how much cable I am using because there's no way, there aren't any markings and this particular tool does not have a hook to catch it when it gets close to the end, so I am a little wary about running the cable out.\n\nThe other problem is I think there is a junction about 6 inches in with a three way drain but I can't tell for sure unless I have a pipe camera.\n\nSo I think I may be missing the clogged drain because I think there is a 90 degree left facing angle, up and down and I keep hitting either the up or down and not the left where the clog is.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips for how I can remove the clog given this situation?",

A primer for rusty metal recommended and a top coat of an exterior acrylic latex paint is probably best. Light colors recommended. Less thermal expansion on the metal if color is lighter.

    "text": "Home renovation contractor etiquette: When should they be cleaning up after themselves? Is it normal to use your garage as their workshop?\n\nMy husband, 3 dogs, and I are living through a miserable home reno (currently starting week 4 of a 6-8 week project). The workers perform very poor quality work and are total slobs (see my former post about them treating all of my bathrooms like they're gas station stalls and I'm the gas station attendant hired to clean their urinals). Apparently the contractor lost his good crew during Covid (yes he admitted this).\n\nI don't know if I have outrageously high expectations during a home renovation or if I am being reasonable. I am questioning my sanity and my judgment. **Can someone share what is a normal expectation in the circumstances below so I know what type of conversation I should have with the boss as the home reno progresses?**\n\n1. COVERING FLOORS DURING DEMO:  His selling point was they cover everything; floors with RAM board, doorways with plastic, etc. We had fairly new perfect condition tile on our basement floor. They didn't cover the floors at all, then demoed the basement. We noticed at the end of demo day. They covered the floor later since we requested it. Boss said they didn't cover it because \"it is glossy tile so it's hard for them to damage it.\" QUESTION: Would glossy tile normally be covered to protect it during demo and the remainder of the job?\n2. CUT MATERIAL ON FLOORS, NOT ON WORKBENCH: After they covered those tile floors with ramboard, they cut sheetrock by laying it directly on the floors and slicing it with a blade. It sliced right through the ramboard and scratched the tile (dozens of slices in ramboard so clearly not a 1 time issue).  QUESTION: Is it ever okay in the construction world to slice material directly on the homeowner's floor?\n3. USE HOMEOWNERS GARAGE LIKE IT'S THEIR WORKSHOP: We had an apartment in 75% of our garage. We used it as storage and used the remaining 25% as our garage. The current project was to demo the apartment. End result: 25% of garage is a new laundry room, 75% of garage is actual garage. Since converting it back to a garage 3 weeks ago, the contractor has been using it to store his tools, sheetrock, other materials, etc. I guess he thought it was okay since we have some of the material we purchased ourselves in their (cabinets and shower enclosure). During the day they leave the garage door open, cut materials feet in front of garage door so entire garage is covered in construction dust. Now all of the contents we previously stored in that former apartment and garage is literally sitting in our living room and in a pod in our driveway. I am 8 months pregnant and my due date is in 8 weeks, we need to start getting our house in order and thought we could it do it as the job progressed. We didn't think our 2 car garage would become his very messy work space. QUESTION: Am I out of line to ask him to make room in the garage and stop using it as his workspace so we can vacuum up all the construction dust and start putting our stuff back in there? Can I tell him to take out the materials/tools he needs for the day, then shut the garage door during the day so the dust isn't filling our garage and we can use it again for ourselves? \\*Edit: If he wasn't causing such a huge mess in there I would let it all go. But even our garage fridge is covered in dust (my husband and I covered it too late, we didn't know what they were doing in there).\n4. SHOULD THEY TELL YOU BEFORE THEY FILL YOUR HOUSE WITH DEBRIS DUST: When they decided to cut sheetrock in our basement rather than do it outside, it created a horrendous cloud of dust that made its way from the basement to the next 2 floors of our entire house. I  didn't realize until I got home. They didn't cover a single doorway. That night my husband and I went to Home Depot and got materials to cover every doorway ourselves.  I am still washing every linen, every dog bed (3 dogs), and rewashing the clean laundry I had out but not yet put away, since everything had a layer of sheetrock dust. I still cannot get it out of the carpets and couch despite vacuuming. Again, note that when we hired him he said they cover everything. QUESTION: Should they have warned us \"btw we plan on creating a huge mess of sheetrock and spackle dust today so cover all your rooms and doorways?\"\n5. SHOULD THEY CLEAN UP THEIR MESS AT THE END OF THE DAY OR WEEK: Our house is separated by our foyer: kitchen/dining room on one side; living room and stairs to 2nd floor bedrooms on the other side; foyer in the middle. Currently our foyer is covered in ramboard and plastic blocking all doorways. The foyer is COVERED in sheetrock dust and spackle dust from them walking back and forth out of the basement and doing a bit of work in the foyer. I have been vaccuming every night to limit the dust and just upgraded to a shop vac for this. It is so bad that my dogs are throwing up from hacking on the dust, I'm getting nosebleeds, and I have swollen cakey under eyes from the allergic reaction. QUESTION: At the end of the week, or end of the day, should the contractor do something to clean up the sheetrock dust from the center of our house? Or just leave it like its a construction site until the end of the job and we are responsible to clean it every night and every weekend after they leave?\n\nAll of this is compounded by the fact that the work quality is poor and I am sure it is costing their boss more money to repair their poor quality of work as the job progresses. Now he is trying to save money since he spends so much fixing their mistakes. \n\n**EDIT: This was very helpful feedback. Here is some extra info:**\n\n\\-Pre-covid this guy had a fantastic reputation in our area. He worked on my friend's house and was great. This is a different crew than his pre-covid work, so the experience is totally different. He was actually more expensive than the other contractors we considered so we thought he would be worth paying the extra money.\n\n\\-Regarding the bathrooms, I was just using that as an example of their sloppiness and lack of consideration for us and our homes. That issue was resolved after 2 weeks when I threw in the towel and asked the contractor to get a porta-potty. See my earlier post for the graphic details. \n\n\\-We had a very detailed contract as far as scope of work goes. I actually sent it back twice with markups to ensure that there is no ambiguity in the scope of work. I did not include common sense items: the way in which sheetrock should be cut and that it must be cut outside of the house; it's not bring your kid to work day and hand him a hammer; pee inside the toilet bowl when using the homeowners bathroom, etc.\n\n\\-Believe it or not, I am an attorney. We weighed our options here. If I wasn't so close to the end of my pregnancy we would have fired them in the beginning of the job. Unfortunately, that would have inevitably resulted in litigation. Pre-covid, this type of case moved slow. Post-covid, litigated matters are completely backed up, especially those that are recently filed. If we went to consumer affairs (the administrative agency route), we would likely be required to give him the opportunity to cure the defects (which he is willing to do). Considering the circumstances as a whole, it is easier to micromanage the rest of this job, double check every bit of his work, and ensure that it gets done. Otherwise it would cost us more time and money to litigate and find someone to complete the job. \n\n\\-My husband and I, both individually and as a couple, have had multiple conversations with the contractor about the situation. He responds fairly well to my husband. He does not want to hear a 5'4 pregnant lady explaining to him that his monkeys don't know how to install sheetrock screws which are now imbedded in the wall and will result in screw pops in months. Instead, he responded with an excuse for everything. Ultimately he fixes it after we point it out, but I am questioning whether I am asking too much of him with these things. This is why I turned here to figure out what is actually expected during construction because I truly have questioned myself as a result of his **excuses** (see below).\n\n1) The guys didn't cover the basement floor because it's high gloss tile so it's hard to ruin. \n\n2) The new baseboards are bent and scratched up because that's the type of baseboard it is, no one ever complained about it before. (I told him I am sure they came out of the box looking brand new). \n\n3) They demoed a bathroom and didn't shove a rag in the drain pipes to shield the gasses from escaping and the debris from entering the pipes because they thought we wouldn't be reusing those drains for laundry and a sink. \n\n4) They didn't cover any doorways (as discussed) or warn us about the havoc they're about to reek in our home because dust gets everywhere anyway. (Note that the construction is taking place in the basement and 25% of the garage, not the living space, the rest of the house could have been protected to an extent.)\n\n5) In the middle of demoing a room, they put new sheetrock up on one wall that had termite mud/damage and rat poop all over the wood and insulation in an effort to cover it up for an unknown reasons. (My husband and I happened to come across the damage at night after they left but before they put the sheetrock up in the morning.) The owner then removed it, cleaned out the poop/insulation, replaced with new insulation, and installed new sheetrock when the demo portion was over. \n\n6) They insisted on leaving the old bouncing vinyl floor and installing the new vinyl planks on top of it despite the contract stating otherwise. \n\n7) My husband insisted that they finish demoing the apartment. They said they cannot demo the floor because the old insulation is sitting in a pile on the floor in the way and they would have to move their table saw out of the way. Demo of that room is part of the job. That is the room we are renovating....it made no sense. Later the removed the insulation, put it in their truck, then brought it back the next day intending to reuse it in our basement. The owner made them throw it out and order new insulation. \n\n8) They didn't want to demo the bathroom because they wanted to continue using it. Unfortunately we were removing that bathroom and converting it to a laundry room. Keeping it was not an option....\n\n9) He tried to say they didn't cut material on the floor and those razor slices are simply from sheetrock boards scratching the ramboard. \n\n**RECENT EVENTS:**  I've tried talking to this contractor as a nice normal homeowner, a sweet little girl, a stern and frustrated customer, a polite lawyer who means business, every type of delivery I could think of, all it did was bruise his ego and aggravate him for questioning him. When he did ultimately cover a new baseboard and I thanked him for it, he walked away from me because he was upset that I didn't already expect him to cover it. His philosophy is \"as long as I correct my worker's mistakes then you should trust my work and disregard theirs.\" \n\n**THIS MORNING:** So this morning I hit peak anxiety about the effects on a fetus after inhaling the outrageous amount of sheetrock dust in every part of my house that resulted from their lack of warning or efforts to cover a single thing (going on 3 weeks of me cleaning every night to fix it, using an air scrubber fan, every vacuum I can access, etc). **So he was confronted on the lawn by a hysterical very pregnant lady in socks, no shoes, yoga pants, no bra, a T-shirt, and her deceased grandma's oversized sweater.** (It's me, I am the hysterical pregnant lady).  I told him I am terrified of the rest of the work that has to be done by these guys and explained what I have to do to clean up after they cut sheetrock inside the house without covering anything. I then left the house, took my 3 dogs, and am staying at my grandmother's empty house. You may judge all you want. I hit the point of IDGAF, may the bridges I burn light the way.\n\n**Well, it seems that hysterically shouting on the lawn through ugly tears in wet grass stained socks somehow got through to him.** He finally apologized for things and actually acknowledged it all, immediately left, went and got protective plastic with zippers (wish I knew about this sooner) to add to what my husband and I already covered, replaced the absolutely filthy ramboard (got a flat tire on his way to the material shop), and told my husband that these guys will be done and he is bringing in a new crew. My husband says the poor guy is totally beaten down and nearly in tears. I feel bad but in reality his guys have been destroying my home for going on 4 weeks. If your crew has absolutely no idea how to install sheetrock screws and has no problem trashing someone's home then they shouldn't be on a job. He only admitted to the faults for the first time during my meltdown today. Prior to that it was all deflecting blame and giving me excuses.\n\nWe shall see how the rest of the time goes. I am staying away before the debris and the stress has some alternative impact on this pregnancy or I make another grown man cry again.",

It ended up getting 1.3 million views, which we weren\u2019t expecting at all, so we figured we owed you guys an update.\n\nWe also figured the WallStreetBets crowd would appreciate the chaos of this project too, even if we forgot the dumpster.\n\nWe were originally planning to mount the sign on the garage or sink some 4x4s into the ground, but we scrapped all that. We didn\u2019t want to be liable for the 400-pound sign falling on someone\u2019s head. So now it\u2019s just sitting on two sawhorses. Luckily, the \u201cW\u201d and round Wendy\u2019s logo cover them almost completely, so you can\u2019t really see them unless you\u2019re looking for it.\n\nWe ripped out all the original neon tubing and replaced it with 400 LED modules, powered by two 300-watt drivers. About 120 LED modules went into the logo, 100 into the \u201cW\u201d, and 40 across each of the other letters. We had to wire everything together ourselves to make sure the entire system could connect to the drivers properly, which took a while but ended up working great. We also used an HVAC vacuum to clean out the inside of the beam and get rid of all the loose rust, plus whatever was growing in the letters. It looked like some kind of fungus in there. This thing turned out way better than we expected, and it\u2019s insanely bright. You\u2019ll see in the videos, it lights up the whole yard and shines straight into our neighbors\u2019 windows, which was kind of the goal.\n\nOn the way to our place, the \u201cS\u201d in the sign cracked, so we\u2019re still in the middle of gluing it back together. We also pulled out three old transformers from inside the sign, which probably dropped the weight by around 100 pounds.\n\nNow we\u2019re just waiting for a neighbor to file a complaint or for our landlord to randomly show up and ruin everything. We\u2019ve got about a year left in this house, so if anyone around the Columbus, Ohio area is interested, we\u2019ll probably be looking to sell it next July. Thanks again to everyone who commented or gave advice. The videos linked show just how ridiculous it looks at night.",

I didn't even know about pocket hole jigs before starting this project and looking for a solution to connecting the cross braces for the shelves to the braces on the wall. \n\nI have a couple of things to add just to improve it structurally. I need to find longer connectors to wire the lights together so that I only have to plug one in. Once I do what I have planned for the other side I might get an electrician in to really get the lights and other wiring in order. \n\nNow I have lots of storage space to clean up the rest of that mess!",

    "text": "Also, those look like regular screws. Just a heads up - you shouldn't use screws (especially not drywall screws) any time you expect considerable load because screws don't have great shear strength - it's like a few hundred pounds per screw. In applications where the load *needs* to be carried by the fastener, you should use a carriage bolt that is rated for the load you anticipate could possibly be up there, plus a generous safety factor. Carriage bolts are meant to carry thousands or tens of thousands pounds, unlike screws.\n\nBut adding some blocking the way u/StrikeCurrent55 suggested is the best solution whenever possible. Creating a continuous column, even if broken up by the shelves, will transfer the load all the way to the ground, and there's virtually no way that's breaking because wood has incredible compression strength lengthwise. The blocking you install between those shelves and down to the floor should be snug so they stay in place without the screws. This way, you know the screws are just holding the blocking in place and not carrying any of the load.",

Far better quality than anything you'll ever get at the lumber yard today.\n\nBut the big reason for it lasting as long as it has is the layers of old paint. Not just paint like today.. but old OLD paint..  the kind that they.. you know.. made using LEAD..  Stuff really holds out.  Toxic as hell, and I really hope you're protecting yourself removing it.. but whatever you put on it after today won't come close to protecting it like what was on it.\n\nAnd that's why the top row of panels isn't coming off as easily.. it's the part of the door that's been somewhat protected - be it by the overhang of the roof and the arbor, but it's not as exposed to the elements as the lower panels are.\n\nMy advice: Forget staining. You are never going to get it completely cleaned up enough and perfect, and if you do manage to do that, you probably aren't going to get it to stain well without it being blotchy.  I (if I were you) would get out my random orbit and little mouse sander, sand it to get things smoothed up and cleaned up, then hit it with the best exterior primer money can buy, and repaint it. Seal it up and hopefully it'll last another 30 or 40 years.",

(in the first pic that's my dad, lol I'm actually only 33 years old) \n\n\n\nSince people mostly want pics -- I put everything in a nice imgur album at the end organized by progress as I went through the project.  Everything in the album is clickable for full resolution!\n\n\nThis was over the course of a few weeks, had to keep busy as I lost my job in early 2015, along with someone I deeply cared and loved for dumping me after I helped her through cancer.... (she dumped me 2 weeks after a full recovery via facebook -- classy huh?) Never felt more used in my life.   Onto the good stuff though.\n\n\n* Tore out remaining ceiling, put up 100% new ceiling with texture in its place\n* retextured walls \n* installed 4 X 4ft ballast with 6000K lighting, also put in a 2 ft light independently wired over the washer/dryer area.\n* painted everything - pure white\n* rented diamond grinder from home depot and ground 40 years of shit off the floors (before and after pics in the album)\n* bought some Kobalt cabinets from Lowes - very nice quality\n* had to wait for weather to cooperate but did my own epoxy floor with the \"Epoxy-Coat\" kit from (with Legacy Industrial primer kit as a base) it came out AMAZING, it's all in the days and days of prep you do.\n* clear coat urethane coating (Legacy Industrial) with a 20% dose of shark grip non slip additive. \n* Kobalt wall track system for various tools/ladders\n* 50 foot retractable air hose ceiling mounted - (8 gallon kobalt compressor in the attic out of sight - wall switch activates it!) \n* baseboards and various finishing touches.\n* awesome automotive flags\n\n\nSome notes on the epoxy floor -- it REALLY is all about the prep. The finished grey \"super shine\" pics, are actually when the floor is dry, you can walk on it exactly like that!, it was like walking on grey ice, super smooth and perfect. (the blue tarp on the garage door was me just trying to keep bugs/leaves out while it cured for 24 hours)\n\n\nWith the concrete grinding -- I learned my lesson, I should have painted AFTER.  That damn dust gets *everywhere*, I used a respirator of course, and just got filthy. \n\n**Link to album below** \n\n** http://imgur.com/a/9nuHe ** \n\nNow all I need to do is find a job -- lol anyone know where a nerd with a B.S. in Economics from A&amp;M with IT and oil and gas experience can get a job in DFW? :)",

    "text": "Contractor Did a Bad Job on Garage Floor Epoxy. Should I remove it and reapply, or just apply more Epoxy on top after some cleaning?\n\nHello folks! I recently had my contractor finished the garage, including applying Rust-Oleum epoxy to the floor. He was in a hurry to finish off this last task and I think he messed up, or at least the finish didn\u2019t meet my expectation. He did prepare the surface the previous day, including filling the cracks. However, right before he painted epoxy, he didn\u2019t spend enough time and effort to mix epoxy with hardener. Later we let it dry for a week, but it still felt tacky in many places. You can hear squeaking noise as we walk through the garage in rubber slippers. Then it gets black very quickly due to tackiness. In one spot, you can still feel the slightly wet glue. It has been two months now. I have tried to brush off some black spots with general cleaners, but that doesn\u2019t sound like the best solution. Should I ask my contractor or someone else to remove existing epoxy and redo the whole job? Or should I just clean up black spots and reapply a layer directly on top? If someone add the extra layer properly, will it actually look like as it should be? Many thanks!",

Clean rust and prime or cut and replace plate?\n\nI bought my home a year ago and I was aware of this issue but just now able to invest in repairing it. I have a vintage (1946) solid brick home which has a garage with a roof deck.\n\nThe steel lintel above the garage door has suffered from water intrusion leading to rust, and the rust has now led to deformation of the lintel, in turn leading to cracks in the mortar above the door and in some bricks next to the door, images here: https://imgur.com/a/NID8AP1\n\nI have received three estimates for repairing the mortar and brickwork and preventing further damage.\n\nAll three are agreed that I want to remove bricks above the plate, install flashing and insert weeps to allow moisture to evacuate from the plate. But two estimators suggest cleaning and priming the rusty plate while one estimator suggests cutting the plate and welding a new plate on. My questions are:\n1. How long would I expect a \"clean and prime\" solution to last before additional rust leads to more mortar/brick damage?\n2. Is the \"cut and weld\" solution likely to be a true long-term fix or require rework on the same timeline as clean and prime?\n3. Are the estimates reasonable?\n\n**Estimate 1:**\n* remove bricks above plate\n* cut off corroded plate, weld new steel plate primed with corrosion resistant paint\n* install drip edge over caulking, rubber flashing, place weeps\n* clean and replace removed bricks and mortar\n* spot clean, grind, point any needed issues in the project area\n* spot clean, grind, point an additional rear bay window\n$7650\n* grind mortar and caulk gaps in 12 4\" coping stones on roof deck\n$1370\n* Total: $9020\n\n**Estimate 2:**\n* remove bricks, clean rust from I-beam, prime/paint\n* install stainless drip edge and flashing\n* clean &amp; reinstall bricks\n* spot tuckpointing in project area\n$2650\n* replace mortar and caulk on coping stones\n$1500\n* tuckpoint bay window\n$650\n* Total: $4800\n\n**Estimate 3:**\n* paint I-beam and install flashing\n* spot tuckpointing\n* recaulk coping stones\n* Total: $3500",

Keep in mind rust is up to 10x steel volume so limited section loss can look worse than it is.\n\nAlso consider that it may even be easer in some cases to replace the lintel vs trying to clean and coat which takes alot of man hours in surface prep.

    "text": "Scotchgard question for protecting carpets\n\nI recently purchased a house and the carpets in it are about 5 years old.  They look pretty good and I would like to try and keep them that way.  We have two young children and two dogs, so the carpets can and likely will get abused a bit.  I was recommended by a friend and after having done some online research, it appears there are a variety of formulations of their protective spray.  Namely, they have one specifically for carpets and rugs:\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/Scotchgard-Rug-Carpet-Ounces-Protector/dp/B086H4TQXT](https://www.amazon.com/Scotchgard-Rug-Carpet-Ounces-Protector/dp/B086H4TQXT)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also found there is a more robust formulation for outdoor fabrics called Outdoor Watershield:\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/Scotchgard-Heavy-Water-Shield-13-Ounce/dp/B01M5BI455/ref=sr\\_1\\_4?crid=1ZU8QLUXF3C1A&amp;keywords=scotchgard+outdoor+water+shield&amp;qid=1650916191&amp;s=hi&amp;sprefix=scotchgard+out%2Ctools%2C104&amp;sr=1-4](https://www.amazon.com/Scotchgard-Heavy-Water-Shield-13-Ounce/dp/B01M5BI455/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1ZU8QLUXF3C1A&amp;keywords=scotchgard+outdoor+water+shield&amp;qid=1650916191&amp;s=hi&amp;sprefix=scotchgard+out%2Ctools%2C104&amp;sr=1-4)\n\nThe outdoor formulation seems to offer a more robust waterproofing effect, but I am wondering what makes this specifically \"outdoor\" use and not for interior materials?  In particular, I would like to try using the Outdoor Watershield spray on high traffic areas for maximum waterproofing effect.  Has anyone here use one or both of these protection sprays and can comment on what makes one outdoors and the other indoors?  \n\nThank you.",

    "text": "Update.  I ordered a can of the Outdoor Watershield and tried it on a small section of carpet behind the door as a test.  The spray has an odor and leaves behind vapors immediately after application.  Likely best used outdoors, hence the warnings on the label and it nothing for use on carpets.  Anyways, The product became odorless after 24 hours dry time.  I tested the waterproofing abilities by first sprinkling large drops of water onto the treated area, and also onto an untreated area for comparison.  The water still soaked into the carpet fibers the same with both samples.  I haven't tried using a staining liquid like wine or coffee so I cannot comment on the stain-repelling effects, if any.  \n\nThought I'd post this up in case any others are looking at carpet protecting products.  I'm now going to give the Rug and Carpet Scotchgard a try and see if there is any difference.",

The outdoor spray leaves a residue that gets onto bottoms of feet and shoes and makes it more slick on smooth surfaces like polished wood floors.  The rug and upholstery spray does not - at least not to the same extent.  I suppose a slick surface makes sense for repelling water and stains.  Both products did not result in the treated surfaces actually causing water to bead up and not soak in.  However, that doesn\u2019t seem to be possible with the tiny individual fibers of the carpet I have.  I think the main goal of this product is to prevent stains and make cleaning out messes easier, not so much to prevent them.",

    "text": "Lowes bulk pricing on blow-in insulation is great.\n\nWe just bought a house in Missoula, MT! On our [list of projects)[[House Projects - Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ARNzjQ353gQ19jPYBOEcOIqASp9eZNQIr_h4ZvjW0nE/edit?usp=sharing)] is adding additional insulation to the attic.  We\u2019ve lived in this house for 10 years and finally bought it from our friend/landlord who owned the house.\n\n**A brief overview of the project:**\n\nI just blew in 65  [bags of GreenFiber R- 19 Cellulose insulation](https://www.lowes.com/pd/GreenFiber-R-19-Blown-In-Insulation-Sound-Barrier/3227256)  into my attic. \n\nAfter calculating the number of bags I\u2019d need and doing the math I realized that buying 70 bags at $4.87 is the same price as buying 100 bags at $3.41 (their bulk pricing rate). So I picked up 100 bags, used 65 of them, and just sold the remaining 35 bags on Facebook Marketplace for $100, bringing my total cost down to $241. \n\nThat cost doesn\u2019t reflect the time I\u2019ll spend wondering why I decided to blow in insulation on a day that hit 100 degrees, but that\u2019s my own problem. Hopefully, this can save you some coin.\n\n**Product details (brands/prices/purchase locations):**\n\n*  65  [bags of GreenFiber R- 19 Cellulose insulation](https://www.lowes.com/pd/GreenFiber-R-19-Blown-In-Insulation-Sound-Barrier/3227256)   purchased Lowes\n\n*I selected this product because of cost and convenience, It\u2019s a common material where I live and I already had 5 inches of cellulose in my attic, also: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Refuese. \n\n**Other materials:**\n\n* 3M Paint Project Respirator, Medium borrowed from my mom -  originally Purchased from Amazon\n\n* Tyvek paint suit purchased at Lowes - $13.48 [Trimaco XL Tyvek Paint Protective Coveralls in the Protective Clothing department at Lowes.com](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Trimaco-XL-Tyvek-Paint-Protective-Coveralls/50281813)\n\n* Eye Protection - $29.98 [3M Scotchgard Plastic Anti-Fog Safety Goggles in the Eye Protection department at Lowes.com](https://www.lowes.com/pd/3M-Scotchgard-Plastic-Anti-Fog-Safety-Goggles/1001845208)\n\n* Panic purchased knee pad from Lowes - $34.98 [TOUGHBUILT GelFit Pro Stabilizer Knee Pads in the Knee Pads department at Lowes.com](https://www.lowes.com/pd/TOUGHBUILT-Knee-Pads/1003095630)\n\nSome photos of the show: [Insulating - Album on Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/VMagzDJ)\n\n**Overall budget:**\n\nCost breakdown is in the Google Doc above, but 100 bales of insulation cost me $341 and I sold the remaining bales for $100 making the final cost $241. Add the cost of a one time use Tyvek suit of 413.48 makes the final cost: $254.48\n\nOther Reusable tool costs:  $64.96 for knee pads and goggles. \n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. I called Lowes to let them know I was coming so they could drop the pallets before I arrived. \n\n1. Acquire the blower machine, insulation, suit, and goggles.\n\n1. Drive 10mph down a 45mph road with two too tall pallets of insulation that probably should \nhave got me pulled over. \n\n1. Fix other attic related things before blowing in the insulation (new light bulbs and new vent hoses from the bathroom fans)\n\n1. Set up the blower machine and ensure the hoses can reach all corners of the attic.\n\n1. Start in the far corner and paint yourself into the exit. \n\n1. Be done!\n\n1. Clean up \n\n1. Return machine\n\n\n**Issues/challenges:** \n\n* I first attempted to go into the attic with 88 cent googles from Walmart and a KN95 mask with ear straps. This did not work out well for me. The goggles kept fogging up and/or the mask position was ineffective at blocking the particulates.\n \n* Our blower machine stopped working 3/4 into the project and we had to go to Lowes and get a replacement. We had clogging issues and because cellulose is \u201crecycled material\u201d it\u2019s basically just a bunch of ground-up garbage that included strips of plastic that gunked up the machine. \n \n* My knees were killing me so I impulse-bought knee pads, they helped but were also a little bulky because I got big ones. \n \n* I also used two 2x4x3\u2019s as braces that I could place across the rafters to get better positions with the blower. \n \n* This project is best done with at least 3 people, we had five (me blowing, my wife and mom feeding the hopper, my son relaying messages, and my dad project managing/opening bags/doing dad stuff) having several hands made this project go smoothly even when we ran into bumps.",

    "text": "My mom just had some work done at her house and the contractors put down [this stuff](https://www.amazon.com/Protection-Strongest-Protector-Self-Adhesive-Protective/dp/B071WD4NLR) (or something like it) to protect the new carpet while they worked. It's like sticky Saran Wrap, but doesn't break when you walk on it, and it stays put. It was there for 3 weeks and after they took it off you'd never know it was there, carpet still looks brand new.\n\nI would suggest putting that down, then a throw rug, then your table. It would fix the issue of spills soaking through a throw.\n\nETA: I just read in the item comments that it's not meant to be left on for more than 30 days at a time. Granted, one roll would give you a lot of re-coverings but keep this in mind when considering this solution. Perhaps instead of putting it on the carpet, put it on the bottom of the throw rug, with the non-sticky side facing the carpet.",

    "text": "Painting Plastic: Hard Shell Fencing Mask\n\nI train and compete in a sport called HEMA, and I'm currently in the market for a new mask. I have my heart set on the mask in the picture, which is essentially a hard plastic shell build over a fencing masks. I'm looking forward to a big painting project so that it matches the colours of the rest of my gear. \n\nProblem is, people have tried to paint hard plastics in our sport before, and typically come across a lot of issues; paint chips off after a hit, gear bags end up full of paint flakes as the paint starts to peel off, etc. \n\nI'm trying to figure out the best way to do this. Near as I can tell, I'll need to scrape off the protective layer common in a lot of hard plastics with a piece of Scotchgard, which shouldn't be too much of an issue. I've done some research on the best paints to use on plastics, but the additional factor is of course that this helmet will likely be getting hit with swords a lot. \n\nI'm under no illusion that wear and tear will prevent the mask from remaining in pristine painted condition, but I'm wondering if anyone has any tips for making paint more impact resistant? If you had to oversee this project, what tips would you give a total newbie?",

    "text": "Help! Need suggestions on how to tackle wet carpet caused by portable air conditioner. Extensive details of what we've tried so far included.\n\nHello DIY!\n\nI hope that you'll be able to help my SO and I with this very stressful problem. We bought a **[refurbished portable air conditioner](http://www.lg.com/us/air-conditioners/lg-LP0711WNR-portable-air-conditioner)** about a month ago and we are now having an issue with the carpet in the bedroom becoming wet and I think that mildew is starting to grow.\n\n**[Here is what our bedroom and our setup looks like.](http://imgur.com/a/x50eC#0)** The room is approximately 9x10'. We have crank windows so we had to finagle a window fitting with a plexiglass panel, duct tape, and **[this spray.](http://greatstuff.dow.com/products/gaps-and-cracks/)** We originally had the air conditioner on the floor, but the tank would fill up every three hours and I am the only one home during the day so I can't lift the a/c to drain it. It's impossible to drain it on the floor, it's the worst design possible. Anyway, so the solution was to put it up on a milk crate and have a tube running from the port in the back down into a 2.5gal gas can. The can usually needs to be emptied twice a day on average. \n\nWe borrowed a steam cleaner and I cleaned the carpet with **[this Hoover solution](http://www.amazon.com/Hoover-CLEANPLUS-Concentrated-Deodorizer-Cleaning/dp/B005NICGBA/ref=sr_1_cc_3?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374860542&amp;sr=1-3-catcorr&amp;keywords=hoover+shampoo)**. The carpet manual said to do one forward &amp; backward slow drag, alternating with wet &amp; dry. So I did one wet, one dry, one wet, one dry. I also did a dry run all over the carpet to suck up as much of the water as possible, since I wanted to use the **[Scotchgard Carpet and Rug Protector.](http://www.amazon.com/Scotchgard-Carpet-Rug-Protector-17-Ounce/dp/B004ZP83GY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374860303&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=scotchguard+for+carpets)**\n\nYesterday's weather: peaked at around 65\u00b0, with humidity beginning around 70% and reaching a high of 95%. When I finished cleaning the carpet and spraying the carpet with the Scotchguard, I closed the door and left the a/c on dehumidify. It set itself at 74\u00b0. Just for extra info here's **[today's weather.](http://imgur.com/iDniEyy)**\n\nWe slept out in the living room because it was too cold in the bedroom. When my SO went in this morning ~6am, he said that the a/c (despite having the gas can setup) had leaked onto the carpet, so he put a mixing bowl underneath the crate to catch the excess water. We had been doing this previously as well. When I went in a few hours ago I was SO frustrated to see (feel) that the carpet was wet AGAIN and that it smelled nasty again. I know he said it leaked but I just don't know what to do anymore. I figured I would start by trying to suck up the excess water? \n\nWe rent this apartment, it's a converted garage attached to a house. I don't know how much it is to replace a rug, or even part of it? or put in some tiles instead? I also don't know if our landlord would pay for it. \n\n**TL;DR: Please help before I beat our a/c Office Space style, then burn that motherfucker.**",

    "text": "- Buy a small plastic tub from walmart or somewhere and put the whole unit, milk crate and all, in the tub - that way any water at all will pool in the tub and not the carpet. The under-bed style ones would probably be good since the sides are low and they're usually big enough for that whole unit to sit in. If you have the space, a $5 little blue kiddie pool would work also. Just anything that you can sit the A/C, milk crate *and* the gas can in, covering all possible leak/condensation drip spots.\n\n- Borrow the steam cleaner again. This time, fill it with a mild bleach (or vinegar) solution - 1/4-1/2 c bleach per gal water or so. Make a few passes over the area that has been consistently wet so that you kill any mold or mildew that has developed. This should also kill any odors. Make several 'dry' passes to suck up as much water as possible. Go over it again with the Scotchguard if you like. (Your carpet is pale enough for this fix - vinegar is better for colored carpets.)\n\n- Shift the tub with the A/C around every day for a few days so that all of the carpet has a chance to thoroughly dry out and not develop mold under the plastic tub. Use a box fan or other floor-level fan to help speed the drying. Expect it to remain damp for probably 2-4 days, depending on relative humidity.\n\nEdit: One more thing. Don't close the door as the carpet is drying. You want more air flow, and shutting the door reduces it. Open it as wide as possible and if you can get a cross-breeze from a slightly-cracked-open window, even better.",

They look pretty good and I would like to try and keep them that way.  We have two young children and two dogs, so the carpets can and likely will get abused a bit.  I was recommended by a friend and after having done some online research, it appears there are a variety of formulations of their protective spray.  Namely, they have one specifically for carpets and rugs:\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/Scotchgard-Rug-Carpet-Ounces-Protector/dp/B086H4TQXT](https://www.amazon.com/Scotchgard-Rug-Carpet-Ounces-Protector/dp/B086H4TQXT)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also found there is a more robust formulation for outdoor fabrics called Outdoor Watershield:\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/Scotchgard-Heavy-Water-Shield-13-Ounce/dp/B01M5BI455/ref=sr\\_1\\_4?crid=1ZU8QLUXF3C1A&amp;keywords=scotchgard+outdoor+water+shield&amp;qid=1650916191&amp;s=hi&amp;sprefix=scotchgard+out%2Ctools%2C104&amp;sr=1-4](https://www.amazon.com/Scotchgard-Heavy-Water-Shield-13-Ounce/dp/B01M5BI455/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1ZU8QLUXF3C1A&amp;keywords=scotchgard+outdoor+water+shield&amp;qid=1650916191&amp;s=hi&amp;sprefix=scotchgard+out%2Ctools%2C104&amp;sr=1-4)\n\nThe outdoor formulation seems to offer a more robust waterproofing effect, but I am wondering what makes this specifically \"outdoor\" use and not for interior materials?  In particular, I would like to try using the Outdoor Watershield spray on high traffic areas for maximum waterproofing effect.  Has anyone here use one or both of these protection sprays and can comment on what makes one outdoors and the other indoors?  \n\nThank you.",

The spray has an odor and leaves behind vapors immediately after application.  Likely best used outdoors, hence the warnings on the label and it nothing for use on carpets.  Anyways, The product became odorless after 24 hours dry time.  I tested the waterproofing abilities by first sprinkling large drops of water onto the treated area, and also onto an untreated area for comparison.  The water still soaked into the carpet fibers the same with both samples.  I haven't tried using a staining liquid like wine or coffee so I cannot comment on the stain-repelling effects, if any.  \n\nThought I'd post this up in case any others are looking at carpet protecting products.  I'm now going to give the Rug and Carpet Scotchgard a try and see if there is any difference.",

The outdoor spray leaves a residue that gets onto bottoms of feet and shoes and makes it more slick on smooth surfaces like polished wood floors.  The rug and upholstery spray does not - at least not to the same extent.  I suppose a slick surface makes sense for repelling water and stains.  Both products did not result in the treated surfaces actually causing water to bead up and not soak in.  However, that doesn\u2019t seem to be possible with the tiny individual fibers of the carpet I have.  I think the main goal of this product is to prevent stains and make cleaning out messes easier, not so much to prevent them.",

    "text": "Keep the Fabric Fabric when gluing to wood\n\nI recently made a music work desk using an old wooden fold-up table and a (2\u2019 x 2\u2019) piece of fabric pictured with music clefs, instruments, and notes on it. First, I cleaned the table and then applied spray adhesive to both the table and the fabric. I used an old plastic credit card to smooth out the fabric and ensure it adhered well while enticing the fabric tighter. This method worked better than expected and gives the table a natural fabric feel without using a catalyst or medium as recommended by most on the internet. Next, I wrapped the fabric under the table and cut it straight, about 1/2\" from the bottom edge of the table. I flattened the fabric edges and used hot air to speed up the drying process. \n\nDespite all the greatness, a lingering query haunts me: How might I adorn and refine the fabric beneath my table?\n\nMy purpose is twofold: shielding it from untimely decay and enhancing its overall allure.\nMoreover, of all the things I could excel at, this is the one I wish to master. I implore you, dear reader, do you possess any brilliant notions that might aid me in my quest?\n\n~Extra Credit: \n\n~ By an uncanny stroke of irony, I decided to give the piece of cloth material an extra layer of protection with a fabric protector after the drying process, fully aware that daring to go against conventional wisdom often leads to unexpected outcomes.",

    "text": "Fabricating a Snap-On KRL1099PBO 'like' toolbox out of the shell of a Harbor Freight 7 drawer side box. Need suggestions for front sheetmetal working &amp; wiring ideas\n\nI have been really liking the look of Snap-On's powerbank system [KRL1099PBO](https://store.snapon.com/KRL1099-Series-PowerCab-End-Cabs-PowerCab-End-Cab-Candy-Apple-Red-P648124.aspx), but I can't justify the $1600 price tag for a side box to go on a toolbox I paid less than a $1000 for. \n\nI know there is a TON of difference between Snap-On and Harbor Freight, but I just can't justify spending that much money on a chest when it can be better spent on the quality tools themselves. \n\nI know this is not the same depth as a Snap-On, but I think it will do what I need. My plan is to buy a [Harbor Freight 7 drawer side box](http://www.harborfreight.com/tool-storage/tool-chests-roller-cabinets/18-in-7-drawer-glossy-red-end-cabinet-for-roller-tool-chest-68785.html), remove all the drawers, reuse 4 of the slides, 1 of the pull rails and then to use 16ga. steel tubing, [Triton Lochook steel peg board](http://www.tritonproducts.com/) and sheet metal to fabricate a new drawer like the one in the KRL1099PBO. \n\nOnce I get everything mocked up, fitted, welded and prepped for paint, I am going to paint it with Seymour Safety Red Enamel paint, which seems to be an almost exact match to the Harbor Freight red. \n\nThe wiring portion is pretty easy to figure out. I'm going to put in an [IEC C13 male plug](http://tinkersphere.com/1799-thickbox_default/male-power-connector-iec-320-c13-c14.jpg) on the back of the box and hard wire it into a power strip mounted on the drawer and then to use some [din rail wiring duct](http://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/n-pktq5q/gswl78/product_images/theme_images/Wiring_Duct_Thin_Gray.JPG?t=1445504653) for cord management of all of my battery chargers within the cabinet. \n\nWith some slight modifications, I should be able to use Snap-On's powerbank accessories for hanging my tools, or worse case, I fabricate my own. \n\nI've figured out my cost to fabricate, and even with a lot of room for error, I'm in it for about $500, which is about $1100 less than the snap-on box **WITH** my student discount of 50% off; or the price of my current [tool box](http://imgur.com/a/8IIDP).  \n\nWould love input, ideas, suggestions etc. on the build... even if its just to say that I'm crazy. \n\nI am sure I am going to get some hate from the Snap-On guys, but that's to be expected when putting anything Harbor Freight and Snap-On in any kind of comparison. \n\n**TL/DR - Question** \n\nA few specific questions I have for the good people of r/DIY would be best practices for routing wire from my plug to the surge protector. A few people have suggested a [drag chain](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610oZxl01SL._SL1100_.jpg), which seems like a good idea, but I haven't dealt a lot with it so suggestions on attaching means would be appreciated. \n\nAnother question I have would be how to best do make the face of the cabinet so that it appears as \"stock\" as possible. Should I do a lighter face than 16ga steel or?\n\nMy experience with tight space bending and shaping sheet metal is limited, so I am not completely sure how to do the lower and upper ribs of the face, as I want to keep the same countours as the original drawers. \n\nAny suggestions or resources would be greatly appreciated.  \n\n**EDIT 1** \nAfter looking at [Snap-On's parts diagram](http://public.snapon.com/R_RRD/parts_lg_objects/images/KRL1099_Parts_PD.jpg) again, it appears they are in fact using a drag chain and just screwing or riveting it on to a bracket inside the box and on the bottom of the drawer. Seems simple enough, I just need to fabricate the brackets and and rivet them on.  I was planning on using 1\" x 3\" 16ga steel sections on the left drawer frame members, so I'm considering routing the drag chain to slide inside of that.  \n\nMy thought for the lock is to keep it simple and just have the lock rod turn a slat into a slot on the drawer at the back of the box to lock it up. This would keep it far enough back that it would be difficult to slip but still be simple enough that it wouldn't be an issue to fabricate. \n\nI haven't really looked enough at the Harbor Freight locks to see how the drawer actuators work, but I might just modify and shorten whats already there. \n\nProbably one of those things that need to be figured out once I get the box and start mocking it up in the coming weeks. \n\n\n**EDIT 2**\n\n\n**TL/DR** \nI am making a custom toolbox, much like the [Snap-On KRL1099PBO](https://store.snapon.com/KRL1099-Series-PowerCab-End-Cabs-PowerCab-End-Cab-Candy-Apple-Red-P648124.aspx) out of a [Harbor Freight 7 Drawer side box](http://www.harborfreight.com/tool-storage/tool-chests-roller-cabinets/18-in-7-drawer-glossy-red-end-cabinet-for-roller-tool-chest-68785.html). [Here is my progress so far](http://imgur.com/a/Tp8FJ)\n\n**UPDATES &amp; CHANGES** - 1/1/2017 \nI have decided to scrap the idea of using the Triton steel peg board, mostly in the interest of keeping the weight down as much as possible on the box, as I'm likely going to already be pushing the limits on the slides with the current setup of the box and all of the tools I am putting in it. \n\nI have also decided to scrap the idea of using enamel paint with rattle cans and instead have decided to op for getting the box professionally powder coated. \n\nI plan to bolt the box to my [current toolbox](http://imgur.com/a/8IIDP) both top and bottom with 3/8\" hardware, as well as to let the lip at the top of the box take a portion of the weight. \n\nI then am going to take the handle which needs to be removed to install the side box, cut it shorter and reslot it to fit again and then will reinstall it on the side of the sidebox. I am going to install rivnuts to hold the handles on.",

    "text": "Fleas and other bites bother you to distraction but noone else in your abode?\n\nThis is a shout-out to those few of us (like the poor 19-year-old a year ago) who are attacked by fleas (and other biters) to the point of trauma when noone else who shares the space is.\n\nI started having problems with this in my 30's when I still had a pet. After experiencing flea infestations that lasted for up to a month despite vacuuming etc. and despite the poor guy having a flea collar and anti-flea drops applied by the vet plus having got rid of every piece of fabric and upholstery I could do without I reluctantly gave him away. Made sense given the common wisdom that fleas can't live any length of time on humans.\n\nThat was most definitely not the end of it. I have been bitten to distraction by spiders (after moving a woodpile), mites that live on birds (after cleaning a swallow nesting box and after looking after a friend's chickens), fleas (after petting dogs (including one whose owner I know keeps her dog immaculately clean, groomed and flea collared), possible bedbugs which I paid for a professional exterminator to treat who told me after the treatment that they found no evidence of, and anonymous biters (ticks?) that, best guess, were living in the tall grass I walked through in Rome and Tuscany.\n\nFor those who suffer similarly and are finding their way still, here are some things I've learned that might help. \n\nFirst, you are not crazy! It may be true that some of these critters don't  live on human blood. But their eggs are incredibly long-lasting even under hostile conditions like freezing. If  you feel like you are being bitten or even irritated by a 'biter', respect yourself by treating your feeling seriously.  I personally find this very hard after so many years having people who care about me treating my situation lightly so I feel isolated, overwhelmed and unsupported. Hopefully you are tougher than me but I find it helps to track 'proof' that there are 'biters' living on me from catching and identifying fleas to taking photos of the mites that have, on two separate occasions, burrowed into my skin. (Yes gross)\n\nSecond, drop everything you can and get on it almost right away. The longer you wait the crazier it could get. Can anyone say 'exponential population growth'? \n\nBut at the same time, don't panic! When I say get on it almost right away, take a day to put together a realistic plan (or less if your nerves are steady and your judgment good.) Be kind to yourself. Try and narrow down what work you need to do. For example, don't do all the work to treat for fleas in your hair if the evidence is that it's headlice. This is usually easier said than done so, if it isn't obvious, move on. Think about your limitations and plan to do daily the things you can keep up for at least 10 days. Schedule a time to do the vacuum/laundry/shower plus treatment at a time that works for you. Then extend the time you vacuum to longer so you're hopefully stopping things from getting a lot worse till then and keep vacuuming for at least 10 days from the throrough treatment. No point attempting to go all out in fighting it by yourself if , for example,you're working two jobs and living with people who can't or won't help. When I paid for a professional to treat for bedbugs I was living in a house with 3 housemates. None of them were willing to join me in fighting whatever it was that was biting me since none of them were getting bitten at all! (See my first comment - no I'm not crazy!). The pest control folks just treated my room. Mercifully that was enough on that occasion. \n\nLastly, stuff that has worked for me. This would be for a major flea infestation. If you think it might be mites or something else you may decide to do less (or different eg headlouse treatment) \n\nMattress protectors. Get one that zips up to completely enclose the mattress and advertizes that it works against bed bugs etc. It will help with fleas too.\n\nVacuuming with a vacuum that has good suction - I tried with a cheap vacuum vs a medium quality one and gotta say get the better one. At least one vacuum that's as thorough as you can get it including upholstered chairs and couches. But just do your best. Some vacuuming is better than none.\n\nDecluttering especially upholstery and fabrics. No carpets, mats or rugs. This works if you have control over your space. For when you don't you may be able to move stuff to temporary storage. \n\nTreating items that may be infested. I've tried freezing pillows, delicate clothes etc thatI thought might be infested and that may have helped.\n\nLaundry: All bedding including pillows. Towels and facecloths. Ideally all clothes you've worn in the last while including other clothes they've been stored with. Do your best. Better to do bedding and today's clothes then keep the clothes you wear separate from stored clothes for a while and wash those when you can.\n\nShowering: Same day as you do a major treatment. Just regular showering better than nothing though I haven't experimented with other treatments.\n\nEssential oils - anything citrus (lemon, orange..) or tea tree oil. About 20 drops in a mister bottle of water then spray it on mattress covers, upholstered furniture etc.\n\nMy thoughts go out to the poor brave souls struggling with this problem. Just know you're not alone!\n\nMuch metta,",

    "text": "Help! Need suggestions on how to tackle wet carpet caused by portable air conditioner. Extensive details of what we've tried so far included.\n\nHello DIY!\n\nI hope that you'll be able to help my SO and I with this very stressful problem. We bought a **[refurbished portable air conditioner](http://www.lg.com/us/air-conditioners/lg-LP0711WNR-portable-air-conditioner)** about a month ago and we are now having an issue with the carpet in the bedroom becoming wet and I think that mildew is starting to grow.\n\n**[Here is what our bedroom and our setup looks like.](http://imgur.com/a/x50eC#0)** The room is approximately 9x10'. We have crank windows so we had to finagle a window fitting with a plexiglass panel, duct tape, and **[this spray.](http://greatstuff.dow.com/products/gaps-and-cracks/)** We originally had the air conditioner on the floor, but the tank would fill up every three hours and I am the only one home during the day so I can't lift the a/c to drain it. It's impossible to drain it on the floor, it's the worst design possible. Anyway, so the solution was to put it up on a milk crate and have a tube running from the port in the back down into a 2.5gal gas can. The can usually needs to be emptied twice a day on average. \n\nWe borrowed a steam cleaner and I cleaned the carpet with **[this Hoover solution](http://www.amazon.com/Hoover-CLEANPLUS-Concentrated-Deodorizer-Cleaning/dp/B005NICGBA/ref=sr_1_cc_3?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374860542&amp;sr=1-3-catcorr&amp;keywords=hoover+shampoo)**. The carpet manual said to do one forward &amp; backward slow drag, alternating with wet &amp; dry. So I did one wet, one dry, one wet, one dry. I also did a dry run all over the carpet to suck up as much of the water as possible, since I wanted to use the **[Scotchgard Carpet and Rug Protector.](http://www.amazon.com/Scotchgard-Carpet-Rug-Protector-17-Ounce/dp/B004ZP83GY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374860303&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=scotchguard+for+carpets)**\n\nYesterday's weather: peaked at around 65\u00b0, with humidity beginning around 70% and reaching a high of 95%. When I finished cleaning the carpet and spraying the carpet with the Scotchguard, I closed the door and left the a/c on dehumidify. It set itself at 74\u00b0. Just for extra info here's **[today's weather.](http://imgur.com/iDniEyy)**\n\nWe slept out in the living room because it was too cold in the bedroom. When my SO went in this morning ~6am, he said that the a/c (despite having the gas can setup) had leaked onto the carpet, so he put a mixing bowl underneath the crate to catch the excess water. We had been doing this previously as well. When I went in a few hours ago I was SO frustrated to see (feel) that the carpet was wet AGAIN and that it smelled nasty again. I know he said it leaked but I just don't know what to do anymore. I figured I would start by trying to suck up the excess water? \n\nWe rent this apartment, it's a converted garage attached to a house. I don't know how much it is to replace a rug, or even part of it? or put in some tiles instead? I also don't know if our landlord would pay for it. \n\n**TL;DR: Please help before I beat our a/c Office Space style, then burn that motherfucker.**",

    "text": "Soundproofing Part II - How to deal with a core-LESS door.\n\nFrom what I can see, my bedroom door lacks a core of any kind. It's a hollow box of about 3mm thick wood. It isn't a hollow core door, those actually have foam or hexagonal divisions in them. This is just a hollow box of irritation that allows human speec to pass through.\n\nCurrently, the door is completely sealed around the edges with weather stripping and one of those rubber door bottom sweepy things. The front is also planned in acoustic wedges. This has reduced the sound by nothing whatsoever. But the hallway is much less echoey!\n\nHere's what I need: A bedroom inside of which I can't hear every squeak of my roommate's chairs. I hear every word said in this apartment (not from neighbors, just within the suite of rooms I share with my roommates) even whispers. I also hear every fart. Every scratch of pencil on paper. Every minor shifting of body weight resulting in fabric moving against the fabric. I need those sound gone or at least reduced to the point where it can be tuned out. I have a budget of 200 dollars.\n\nMy current plan is to try and sew several moving blankets together to make a 2-3 inch thick curtain to hang in front of my bedroom door. Recording hobbyist say these are terrible for soundproofing because they only dampen high frequencies like speech. I don't give a crap about bass tones or \"studio quality\". This is what I want so I assume this is the best option. I just want the sound of people talking to go away.\n\nAbout all I can do is tape things to my door, or install a thick curtain made from say, 12 pounds worth of moving blankets in front of it made from heavy and dense materials. Are there other options? Will this work, or should I silently start hoping my roommates go mute?\n\n---**---\n\nThe following are not options for me, everyone always asks me why I don't \"just do _______.\" so I'm getting them out of the way.\n\nNoise generators - I'm autistic. I do not turn noise generators out. They do NOT cancel out sounds for me. They are evil satanic hellspawn that exists only to make areas unbelievably loud. In other words, I'm the person you hate to live with because I keep turning off the fan during the summer because that box fan sounds like a small airplane about to take off to my ears. White noise generators do the same damn thing.\n\nHeadphones - Headphones cause pain. Not \"my wears are bent\" pain. I'm talking \"My eardrums are in extreme physical distress due to the speakers clamped to my ear canals\" pain. No. Headphones. Of any style. They all cause me great pain and make me worry about blood pouring out of my ears after the drums burst.\n\nEarplugs - Nope. You may forget you're wearing them, I don't. I feel them, all the time. It's very distracting. I want to REDUCE distracting things. Not add to them. Also, earplugs just protect your ears from bursts of high pressure and loud noises. They are ineffective for human speech. As anyone holding a conversation in a shooting range can tell you. This goes for earmuffs too. I do not want to wear things on my head all day every day. I want a quiet space.\n\nIndustrial clamshell Ear Protectors as seen in factories - all the industrial ear defenders specifically permit speech frequencies to allow the workers to communicate. I'm trying to block out human speech frequencies. Not the frequency of a pneumatic riveter, a friction welder, and 30 conveyer belts transporting loose bits of metal.\n\nInstalling a solid core door - I live in Fairbanks, Alaska. That door weighs about 70 pounds at the lightest. I'm not made of money. Shipping puts huge premiums on anything with mass. The CHEAPEST door I could find is 347 for the slab, and I'd need to cut out the hinge slots and drill the doorknob out myself. And that's IF my landlord agreed. And I could spend a third of my rent for the month on a door.\n\nSensory deprivation tank/An anechoic chamber - I think this suggestion is intended to be sarcastic. However, I would love one! Same problem as the door though. I'm poor. Also, I don't think I could work on my novels while inside an SDT due to water not liking electronics or paper.",

    "text": "- Buy a small plastic tub from walmart or somewhere and put the whole unit, milk crate and all, in the tub - that way any water at all will pool in the tub and not the carpet. The under-bed style ones would probably be good since the sides are low and they're usually big enough for that whole unit to sit in. If you have the space, a $5 little blue kiddie pool would work also. Just anything that you can sit the A/C, milk crate *and* the gas can in, covering all possible leak/condensation drip spots.\n\n- Borrow the steam cleaner again. This time, fill it with a mild bleach (or vinegar) solution - 1/4-1/2 c bleach per gal water or so. Make a few passes over the area that has been consistently wet so that you kill any mold or mildew that has developed. This should also kill any odors. Make several 'dry' passes to suck up as much water as possible. Go over it again with the Scotchguard if you like. (Your carpet is pale enough for this fix - vinegar is better for colored carpets.)\n\n- Shift the tub with the A/C around every day for a few days so that all of the carpet has a chance to thoroughly dry out and not develop mold under the plastic tub. Use a box fan or other floor-level fan to help speed the drying. Expect it to remain damp for probably 2-4 days, depending on relative humidity.\n\nEdit: One more thing. Don't close the door as the carpet is drying. You want more air flow, and shutting the door reduces it. Open it as wide as possible and if you can get a cross-breeze from a slightly-cracked-open window, even better.",

If you can afford it look for a pure foam pad, meaning one that isn't made from recycled pieces and one that has a moisture barrier on both sides. That barrier keeps from spills staining your subfloor and creating a stain that always shows back up after cleaning. I personally have a 1/2\" Scotch Guard pad(product number #BZ0370) that has a great marshmallow feel when walking on it.\n\nMost flooring dealers should be able to give you a sample of the carpet and padding to look over. I had several set across my kitchen floor and I walked around on them until I felt like I was happy with what I wanted. One tip a installer once told me was to dig your fingers into the fibers until you reach the back of the carpet and if its really easy than its cheap carpet. So try to find some options that have a higher oz per sq ft. something like 32oz or higher is great carpet but can be hard to find with a lower pile. Good luck on your carpet search.",

Consider this when you are choosing a stopping point.  The whole house would yield the most pleasing results but is more work of course. \n\nMore precise and thorough is better than less.  Use the recommended amount of soap in the machine else you risk more residue left behind.  If you carpets are in bad shape, a second pass with clean water only may yield a significant amount of dirt removal and will reduce the soap residue even further.\n\nA final slow pass with no water injection using the vacuum function only can help speed up the drying process.\n\nSpend some time learning how to properly clean carpets before you jump into this.

Build or buy a nice little shoe rack to reinforce the policy. Mats both inside and outside of the door to wipe shoes on before entering. Keep your entryways swept clean and free of debris. Have a carpet cleaner over ASAP to clean your carpet and apply either Scotchgard or Dupont with Teflon carpet protector. These protectors not only protects against oil and water based spills, but against dry soils as well. Then vacuum regularly. That's the number one thing you can do for your carpet between annual cleanings. Even if your carpet doesn't appear to be dirty, it is. And because stairs can truly be a pain in the ass to vacuum, it's important to do all these things I mentioned because in all honesty you're probably not going to vacuum as often as you should.

If I'm not posting in the right subreddit, please let me know. \n\n\nOne of our cats constantly pees outside of one of the litter boxes. Of course it's the only box that is in a carpeted room, and the only reason we put one in that room is because he was already using the restroom in that corner. We have no idea why, and nothing seems to make him stop. \n\nWe put a box in the corner, he goes around the box. We put a large mat under the box, he goes around the mat. So basically my life has become constant carpet scrubbing and cleaning to keep it from smelling and staining. Which sucks. \n\nSo pretty much my question is, will a superhydrophobic spray (like never wet or always dry) work to prevent the pee from soaking into the carpet, and thus easier to clean? \n\nThank you for your time. It's a simple question, but I just can't find a straight answer anywhere on if it would work on carpet for cat urine. If I should post this elsewhere, please let me know!",

    "text": "there are a couple of things you might want to try instead.\n\n1st, Block off the affected area, do not allow the cat access.\n\n2nd, clean the area thoroughly, preferably with a steam/hot water cleaner. DO NOT use any cleaning product containing ammonia, as cats are attracted to the scent and will attempt to mark over it. Allow to completely dry\n\n3rd, Treat area thoroughly with an enzymatic cleaner like [this](http://www.petco.com/product/2437/Natures-Miracle-Stain-And-Odor-Remover.aspx), or [this](http://www.amazon.com/Enzyme-Cleaner-Remover-Eliminator-Neutralizer/dp/B00J4Z5B24), or [this](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Urine-Gone-Stain-Odor-Eliminator-with-Enzyme-Action-24-fl-oz/24706407)\n\n4th, after treatment is complete, allow the cat access to the area.  \n\nI believe this will be far more effective, and cost effective, than a product like neverwet.  One thing to think about, if this behavior has gone on for an extended period there may be no recovering from it short of replacing the carpet and padding.  Once carpet, padding, and possibly a wood sub floor have been repeatedly soaked in  urine and allowed to dry, it may be impossible to remove the faint traces of urine/ammonia that your cat is smelling and using as a trigger/mark for urinating.\n\nHope that this helps you out.",

There are inevitably spots on a carpet that wont' be fully treated, and the pee will just go through there and end up in your under pad and around the area anyway, requiring clean-up and soap for the smell.",

It's insulated except for the garage door. We opted not to go the permit route, and are just putting carpet over concrete slab. I would consider it a partial conversion, so if we ever sell the home, the next owner can decide if they want to use it as a garage or room. We're planning to use it as a playroom. \n\nQuestions: \n\n1. Should i fill in the cracks that run down the middle of the concrete before the carpet is put down? They are no visible cracks except the ones between the slabs.  If so, what product should I use? \n2.   What is the best way to insulate the garage door?",

    "text": "I don't really know, but from your description, I would guess this is either an oil or maybe some kind of clear coat. If it's oil, you might be able to use some dawn soap or similar to clean it up. If it's a clear coat, you may have to use chemicals, but there's a lot of risk for ruining your floor's finish. Acetone or mineral spirits would probably work, as those are what they often use in the spray cans, but if you're going to try this **test it on something you don't mind getting ruined**. An extra piece of flooring would be best, I wouldn't suggest it on any flooring that's actually installed.\n\nSo try the dawn first and go more aggressive only if you're willing to take the risk.\n\nAnyone else have better advice?",

I live with my grandmother and she gets cold very easily so that means air stays at 75\u00b0F\u2026 for me that is a near unbearable indoor temp and I\u2019m constantly sweating and feeling like I\u2019m dying from the heat. My problems comes from the fact the ceiling fan in my room spins extremely slow even at max speed. I\u2019m not fully sure but I believe a bad capacitor could be the cause and I\u2019d like to switch the 2 above and see if that fixes the issue. The one with the white sticker that says H1 in red comes from a fan in a different room that never gets used but spins very fast. The other fan capacitor coming from the fan in my room that doesn\u2019t. Im wondering if it would be okay for me to switch them without the possibility of damaging or even breaking the fans.",

    "text": "/r/DIY is back open - More information inside.\n\nHello everyone,\n\nPlease read below.\n\nFirst off, we appreciate everyone's patience and support during the last week. We understand that the DIY subreddit is an excellent source of information for people who are working through a project of their own. We know that the lack of access has made it difficult for you and we hope you'll accept our apologies.\n\nThe moderation team (and mods across Reddit as a whole) rely on third party apps to keep the subreddit safe and remove rule violations as quickly as possible. Many of us use these apps while we are on the go or when something important happens. \n\nDespite that Reddit has made the very public claim that \"moderation tools will not be impacted\", this could not be further from the truth. Many of the moderation tools that we use are not stand-alone applications. In fact you will be very hard pressed to find any mobile application that is designed specifically for moderators. What this means is that we rely on our 3rd party app of choice for moderation features - many of which are still significantly better than the features that Reddit has implemented into their own app (despite 5+ years of promises from Reddit).\n\nAnother area of impact is [Toolbox For Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/toolbox). Toolbox is a browser extension that adds a huge amount of moderation features that quite simply does not exist on any version of Reddit - mobile, desktop (new) or desktop (old). Without Toolbox our ability to moderate efficiently is gone. ~~[While Toolbox will not be **immediately** impacted by these changes, there are signs of negative change for the long term.](https://www.reddit.com/r/toolbox/comments/141locs/announcement_reddits_upcoming_api_changes_and/)~~    \n\n**[Edit: Toolbox is effectively dead.](https://www.reddit.com/r/creesch/comments/14fxzr4/so_long_and_thanks_for_all_the_fish/)**\n\nUnfortunately, the user experience will be changing as well. Reddit was built off the backs of 3rd party developers. Below are a few examples of how Reddit was improved by allowing 3rd party developers on the platform.\n\n* [Reddit did not have their own mobile app until late 2014 when they bought the  extremely popular 3rd party app Alien Blue.](https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/15/reddit-acquires-alien-blue-the-most-popular-unofficial-reddit-app/)  \n* [AutoModerator was created by a user to moderate their subs more effectively. Eventually they were hired by Reddit and it was built into the website.](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/30ychn/moderators_automoderator_is_now_built_into_reddit/)\n* [RES, or Reddit Enhancement Suite, is a browser extension that improves the desktop experience. It adds features that Reddit has failed to add.](https://redditenhancementsuite.com/features/)\n* There's also many mobile apps available (for now) that make browsing on the go enjoyable. These apps are lighter, more streamlined and much easier to use than the official app. For those of you who have only been using the official app I would encourage you to spend the last few days trying one of the various 3rd party apps so you can see just how poorly built the official app is.\n\nIn addition, as the 3rd party landscape changes on the website you will see less and less people create new apps / browser extensions. Many of the current ones will no longer be updated including moderation tools. With less moderation you will see more spam (OnlyFans, crypto, etc) and more low quality content. Your casual experience will be hindered.\n\nWith that being said, we have reached a very difficult point of trying to determine the next steps and how we continue to maintain the community. We have come to the conclusion that very shortly our ability to moderate the subreddit will be significantly more difficult than it is today. As such, moderating it will take even longer than it does and we will be missing a lot of content that should have been removed.\n\nWith the upcoming API changes, which will impact every subreddit **and everyday users** (even those who believe it will not) we have come to the difficult decision to modify the subreddit rules. \n\n**This decision was made for us by Reddit.** [Like many other subs, we received the message that if we were unwilling to re-open the subreddit we would be removed](https://i.imgur.com/ayPMErN.jpeg). I'd like to stress that we are not re-opening because we're worried about losing our modship - in fact, Reddit has already stepped in and moved me from the top of the list to the bottom.\n\nWe're re-opening because if we don't, the mods that Reddit appoint may not care about the subreddit the way we do. [They already removed my permissions \\(now restored by another mod\\) and moved me down the list.](https://i.imgur.com/WFCBeJD.jpeg)\n\n####Whether you dislike us as mods or dislike mods in general, we have spent years trying to uphold high quality educational content for everyone on the subreddit. Many of us are avid DIYers ourselves and joined the team because of our love for DIY. None of the moderators on /r/DIY are the aptly named \"power mods\" - and we have in fact had a rule for years that we would not allow any power mod onto the team. Any moderator on the subreddit is here because they truly love the community. We were members of this community before we were moderators. **Please understand that if Reddit removes us - your new moderators might not come from the community. They might be power mods. They might not be DIYers themselves. And of course, they might take the subreddit in a drastically different direction than what you'd like.**\n\nOver the years we have received a lot of [feedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/13klj3d/what_happened_to_this_sub/) about certain rules and the difficulties of posting content on /r/DIY. We have tweaked them many times but the end goal has always been to uphold quality over quantity. The upcoming changes by Reddit will reduce our ability to maintain this balance.\n\n##Effectively immediately we have made the decision to make the following changes to our rules- \n\nRule | Description | Why it Existed | Change to Rule | Reason for Change\n--|--|--|--|--\nPhoto Descriptions | Project submissions required some level of explanation for what the photo shows or the steps being completed. | /r/DIY was built on being an educational subreddit first, and a place to show off your work 2nd. By requiring some information on how the steps were completed this would allow casual DIYers or those with less knowledge to have a template they can follow | Photo descriptions will no longer be required. | For years we have been told this was a challenge and reduced the desire to post. We hope this makes posting easier.\nHelp Requests | Help requests were required to have substance or be specific. For example if you were stuck in the middle of a project and had a question about how to solve an issue. | Help requests no longer have to be specific in nature. | This was to prevent the subreddit from being flooded with very generic questions, such as \"what should i build\" or \"have you built this before\". | For years we have been told that this makes finding help too difficult. We hope this makes it easier for those who need help.\nBasic Research | We previously required users to do *some level* of research into their problem before requesting assistance. | This was to prevent the subreddit from being flooded with questions that would be easily found with a quick Google search - such as \"how do i get out a stuck screw\", \"how do i remove a light bulb\". | We will no longer be requiring users to perform basic research into their problem before posting | For years we have been told that people are unsure what to Google. We hope this will alleviate that difficulty.\nImage Hosting &amp; Single Images | Imgur was the only automatic approved image host. Single image posts were not permitted. |  Imgur was the defacto image hosting website for many years. It was light and offered excellent abilities to add captions to photos. This was ideal for /r/DIY. Single image submissions did not provide the detail we required for posts. | We will no longer be requiring users to upload to Imgur and Single image submissions will be accepted. | For years we have been told that Imgur was clunky or people did not know what it was. We have had many people who wished to submit projects with 1 image. As such, as hope this will solve both problems.\nReddit Galleries | Reddit galleries have been disabled on /r/DIY. | Reddit galleries was released in an unfinished state. They display poorly on old.reddit, mobile apps and they have a low character limit for captions. | Reddit galleries will be enabled. | With the above rule change regarding imgur, Reddit galleries will now be permitted.\nYouTube Videos | Videos on YouTube were held to the same standard / requirements as project submissions. We would check each video to ensure it complied. | This was to prevent the subreddit from being flooded with low quality YouTube content. | With the above changes to image submissions, YouTube videos will receive the same standard. | To maintain the same standard between image and video submissions.\n\"Non-DIY\" Projects | We previously had a list of prohibited projects such as \"crafts\", \"software\" and \"general cleaning\". | This was in order to provide a sort of minimum bar requirement to what DIY is. While cooking is very much something you may have \"done it yourself\" is it really worth of the \"DIY\" acronym. | We will no longer have a list of prohibited projects. | We recognize that our standard may not be uniform across the board. Therefore we are removing that standard and acknowledging that \"DIY\" can be far more broad than we have previously required. We hope this brings new users, new content and new variety to the subreddit.\nSpammy Content | Content that may be spam. | To prevent content we deemed as spam. | Our standard for what *was not* spam was previously higher than what Reddit sets. This often presented issues in which Reddit disagreed with our stance. | [We are aligning our standard to the standard put in place by Reddit](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043504051-What-constitutes-spam-Am-I-a-spammer-).\n\n\n##Below is a list of rules that are not changing.\nRule | Description | Reason for No Change\n--|---|----|----|----\nOriginal Content Only | DIY is for things you did. If it was found on the internet then you did not DIY it. | Self explanatory.\nMust be \"DIY\" | Like above, you must have done it. Hiring a professional or your friend / family doing it for you is not DIY. | Self explanatory.\nCivility | Stay civil. Racism, bigotry, sexism, bullying/harassment, doxxing, unwanted gratuitous sexual comments, transphobia, homophobia and personal attacks are not permitted. | Disagreements happen and that's OK, but you should maintain civility.\nSitewide Rules | Rules put in place by Reddit, Inc | These rules have always been enforced.\n\n\n\nThank you for your patience and your support. Please feel free to ask any questions you have and we will be happy to answer them.\n\n#Note - I'll be on and off for the rest of the night and will respond to your questions when I have a chance.",

    "text": "I installed two mini splits, this is how it went\n\nThis is going to be a long post so buckle up (or don't I'm just a reddit post, not a cop). I've just finished installing two mini splits after a 3+ months(!) project and I wanted to document the process, the mistakes made and how it worked and hopefully help someone decide if this is the right route for them. For context I work a full time job and have two small kids to take care of.\n\nOh, and this isn't meant to be a guide of any kind. There great resources already and I could never compete.\n\n# First, some background\n\nOur house has steam heat and a 4 ton AC system. We have a den that's on the side of the house. The ducts to this room ran across the entire attic, down through a closet, down through a pantry in the kitchen into the basement, across the entire basement, across the crawlspace under the den and up in floor vents. We are going to redo our kitchen and I didn't want to design the entire kitchen around a 9\" pipe so it had to go.\n\nOur basement also doesn't have any heat nor cooling and, although moderably comfortable, I wanted to address that too.\n\n# Research\n\nI knew I wanted to get a heat pump to get closer to my long term goal of getting rid of fossil fuels. We live in the north east so it gets cold but not that cold. After lots and lots (and lots) of research I landed on a Mitsubishi Hyper Heat system. Initially I had thought a two head system would be easiest but since the basement and den has such different needs in the frequency of cooling/heating it seemed best to go with two separate systems so they can ramp up/down independently.\n\nI got two quotes from reputable vendors which came in at $14K and $16K which I thought was insane seeing as the two units are less than $4K total (I understand that skill/experience, tools, supplies, insurance etc add to the cost but paying $10K+ for something I could do myself seemed like a lot).\n\nA few things became clear quickly:\n\n* This is a major project, and I am going to have to learn a lot of new skills.\n* There is a very real risk of messing up and potentially ruin the entire system.\n* I'd need an EPA 608 license, whatever that is.\n* I'm gonna have to get a lot of tools.\n\nKnowing that at worst I'd be $4K in the hole (plus some tools) I decided to go for it.\n\nThe first thing was to figure out the number of BTUs needed (how big of a unit). I found that ecomfort's calculator was easy to use but still seemed serious enough to trust. I landed on a 6K BTU/h unit for both the basement and den (for reference one of the quotes I got had two 18K BTU/h, insane for a &lt; 200ft\u00b2 room if you run the numbers).\n\n# EPA 608\n\nTo install a mini split in the US you need to be EPA 608 licensed. You also need this license to buy refrigirant (technically you can buy small quantities without a license but you need one to use it). I used Skillcat to get my license. It's online and it took me two nights of cramming. I found it incredibly useful and interesting, and I'd highly recommend getting it, even if it wasn't required.\n\n# Ordering\n\nI ordered the units from [ecomfort.com](http://ecomfort.com) in late July, and here's what I ordered from them:\n\n* [2x Mitsubishi - 6k BTU Cooling + Heating - M-Series H2i plus Wall Mounted Air Conditioning System - 32.2 SEER2 (MSZ-FS06NA MUZ-FS06NAH)](https://www.ecomfort.com/Mitsubishi-HVAC-MSZ-FS06NA-MUZ-FS06NAH/p112560.html)\n* [2x Wall Brackets](https://www.ecomfort.com/Rectorseal-WBB300/p31087.html)\n* [25' insulated line set](https://www.ecomfort.com/Mueller-MLS143812-25/p70791.html)\n* [50' insulated line set](https://www.ecomfort.com/Mueller-MLS143812-50/p70793.html)\n* [2x surge protectors](https://www.ecomfort.com/ICM-Controls-ICM517A/p153356.html)\n* [2x non fused disconnects](https://www.ecomfort.com/Bramec-20650/p17872.html)\n* [2x wall sleeves](https://www.ecomfort.com/Diversitech-230-WS2/p95039.html)\n* [Easy bend kit](https://www.ecomfort.com/Rectorseal-84381/p145124.html)\n* [Line set covers](https://www.ecomfort.com/Mitsubishi-NY-75/p30650.html)\n\n# Electrical\n\nI had planned on doing the electrical myself as I have lots of experience doing it. But I ended up getting an electrician come out and install the disconnects for me, money well spent seeing as it took them one morning.\n\n# Tools &amp; Supplies\n\nI needed a lot of tools, and I definitely didn't want to skimp here. These are the tools and supplies I ended up buying:\n\n* [Condensate pump for the basement](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XBWNVX8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n* [25' non armored mini split cable](https://www.homedepot.com/p/DuctlessAire-14-4-in-x-25-ft-Wire-for-Ductless-Mini-Split-Air-Conditioner-Heat-Pump-Systems-Universal-14-4-VNTC-25/308016785)\n* [50' armored mini split cable](https://www.supplyhouse.com/Southwire-59351203-EZ-IN-Shielded-Mini-Split-Cable-14-4-Stranded-600V-50)\n* [100' braided drain tube](https://www.supplyhouse.com/Bluefin-VTB058-100-5-8-ID-Braided-Vinyl-Tubing-100)\n* [2x Appion 1/4\" Valve Core Removal Tool](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M7SQGTR/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n* [Appion 5/16\" Valve Core Removal Tool (not used)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008HQ2EZ8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n* [Tube Cutter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019MLSLS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1)\n* [Copper pipe cutter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00018AFG0/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n* [Nitrogen Regulator](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IJI04XW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n* [Yellow Jacket Vacuum Hose (not used)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008GVRHN8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n* [Refrigerant Scale](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M7UE6X0/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n* [Vacuum Pump](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CSGDHQML/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n* [CPS Micron Gauge](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009AXGCSC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n* [Liquid Tight Conduit Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0D2VQM35T/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n* [1/4\" to 5/16\" Connector (not used)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015Y9MEVO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n* [Ritchie Quick Coupler (not used)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OSLCUSC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n* [Yellow Jacket Eccentric Cone Flaring Tool](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ANPKVI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n* [Yellow Jacket Charging Hoses](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044TGMOQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n* [Yellow Jacket Manifold Gauge Set](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BZFWXI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n* [Flare Caps (for leak checking the valve core)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0D31KX95G/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n* Concrete Drill Bit\n* [Suretape UV Tape](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FEO2XK2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n* [Nitrile Gloves](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09JGPVMBB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n* [Non Corrosive Leak Detector Liquid](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082MQZBV5?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)\n* [Nylog](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008HOSQQQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n* Spade and Ring Terminal Connectors (from HD)\n* HVAC Duct Tape\n* Nitrogen bottle (from a welding shop)\n* [2lbs bottle of R410A](https://abilityrefrigerants.com/product/r-410a-refrigerant-2-lbs/)\n* [Digital torque wrench](https://www.amazon.com/CPS-BTLDTW-Digital-Torque-BlackMax/dp/B06Y5DXK7H?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&amp;ref_=fplfs&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A3J4SAL39U2LRE)\n\nI splurged on the gauges &amp; hoses, anything that involved making flares or connecting them. I cheaped out on the vacuum pump (it only needs to work a few times and the micron gauge will keep it honest) and the nitrogen regulator (I could use the manifold to make sure I didn't over pressure).\n\n# The basement\n\nThe basement was the trickiest so we started with that one. We put up the mounting plate and drilled the hole for the lineset. We drilled a very wide hole to avoid having to make 2x 90\u00b0 bends and instead let it come in at a sweeping bend. We ended up drilling it too wide but it was nothing some mud and tape can't fix\n\nRunning the line set was by far the most difficult thing. My FIL ended up donning a hazmat suit and crawling in there. It's dry (thankfully) and dusty but we were able to get it through. Overall it went surprisingly easy, I have expected this to be really hard. My FIL also made some brackets out of PVC pipe that we used as hangers (we needed some indicator this was DIY after all).\n\nBending the line set was really nerve wrecking, but I had tried with and without the easy bend kit and it really helps. It was practically impossible to kink it, even bending a 180\u00b0 bend.\n\n[Line set pulled through the wall](https://preview.redd.it/o3fqcztwic0e1.jpg?width=5679&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1f12c9ddeb18cd273cc5c5dddce88460d212101)\n\nAfter running the line set it was time for flaring which was scary but having good tools really helps. Process went something like this:\n\n1. Cut the pipe.\n   * I bought a new cutter for this as I wanted it to be sharp.\n   * I used very light pressure to avoid making a big burr.\n2. Ream the cut.\n   * I used a Rigid coned reamer that I already had, worked great.\n   * Take your time and don't put too much pressure on it.\n   * Make sure to angle the pipe down and tap it to get the shavings out.\n   * I used my shopvac to get it all out.\n3. Make the flare.\n   * Put nylog on the flare tool cone.\n   * Take it slow and use consistent force.\n   * Leave a little bit of copper sticking out past the clamp, you don't want the flare to be too small.\n   * Don't forget the nut! I almost forgot it once but I lucked out and remember them all.\n4. Inspect\n   * You want it nice and shiny, no scratches.\n   * Make sure it fills the nut.\n\n[She's a beaut' Clark](https://preview.redd.it/cnikzfp3jc0e1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f5285aefca21002294186ce831295c7d9236b6f)\n\nWhatever you do, don't use the factory flare on the line set! They're uneven, small and downright ugly:\n\n[Look at that ugly factory flare](https://preview.redd.it/lp1vid56jc0e1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fe42b6f6f2e44e2401ee55be26a19ed8a3b5b55)\n\nConnecting the line set went smoothly. I bought a new torque wrench to ensure it was accurate as the one I had was a few years old and uncalibrated. I put nylog on the flare faces, making sure I didn't get any on the threads. I aimed for the middle of the torque spec.\n\nElectrical was a breeze, especially with the spade connectors. The hardest thing was figuring out how to remove the electrical panel for full access given the poor manual. I specifically bought armored cable for this one since it goes through the crawlspace so I didn't run it in a liquid tight run.\n\n[All wired up](https://preview.redd.it/limu1ed9jc0e1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b69fd6d5019e961e602675b2b218579459ffc8f)\n\nMitsubishi doesn't call for a pressure test, just a triple vacuum, but I decided to do one anyway. Here is the rough process I used:\n\n1. Remove the core from the service port.\n2. Connect two valve core removal tools\n   * You connect one to the service port.\n   * You connect the other to the service port of the core removal tool.\n   * This allows you to isolate your vacuum gauge to avoid having to clean it.\n   * I learned this from AC Service Tech LLC on Youtube\n3. Connect the vacuum pump\n   * I had bought a large vacuum hose, but it turned out it was 5/16\" and I needed 1/4\", so much for the ports being universal.\n   * I ended up using my manifold for the vacuum which worked out well.\n4. Pull a mild vacuum. I pulled to 4000 microns and make sure it held for a few minutes.\n   * I initially hadn't tightened the hoses enough which nearly gave me a heart attack but after re-tightening it there was no issue.\n5. Connect the nitrogen bottle and pressurize to 300 PSI.\n   * I applied leak detector liquid to all the joints.\n   * I closed of the valve closest to the unit to minimize the result of leaks and only turned it on when it was time to check.\n   * Don't forget to isolate your vacuum gauge. It doesn't love positive pressure and I didn't want to risk breaking it.\n6. Make sure it held for over an hour.\n   * Tap on the gauge to make sure it doesn't move.\n7. Let the nitrogen out.\n8. Pump down to 2000 microns\n9. Break with nitrogen\n10. Pump it baby.\n   * I let it pump for 30 minutes.\n   * It went down to 400 microns.\n   * You'll want to open/close all the valves to let any trapped nitrogen out.\n11. Wait 1+ hours\n   * I ended up waiting 3 hours.\n   * The final reading was 460 microns.\n\n[460 microns](https://preview.redd.it/sa1o83rnjc0e1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f458c15760c2490510d16040a6cb55e6be533a5b)\n\nAt this point the unit was ready for the additional refrigerant I needed. The max line set length for the factory charge is 25' and I had 34'. You needed 20g/m so this should be easy. Except I messed up, big time. I calculated the added charged as if I was 34' too long, not 9' too long so I ended up adding a little bit over 200g instead of the 60g I needed. After the panic and questions of life choices had settled I started thinking. I vacumed out my manifold, weighed it, connected it to the system, removed it and weighed it again. It was about 100g. I chalked that, paired up with the release of connecting the hoses, added up to 140g. I dumped it into a vacuumed bottle I had laying around and called it a day. At best I'm perfect, at worst I'm 40g/1.4oz over which comes out to &lt; 5% over charge, hopefully no big deal.\n\nFiring it up was nerve wrecking but it worked like a charm and it was able to blast out an impressive amount of heat, phew.\n\n# Den\n\nThe Den was way easier, the connections were made outside and we only had about a 16' run. I ran the line set, condensate and electrical in a line set cover here. I used a 3% grade on the horizontal run for the condensate. The procedure was very similar to the basement, with just a few differences.\n\nDrilling the hole through the house was much harder as it was about a foot of brick, lath, plaster and shiplap.\n\nI saw a slight pressure drop during the pressure test. A valve was slightly opened but I was freaked out a bit so I left with with 300PSI over night. It dropped 5PSI over night which made my anxiety worse. After leaving it for a few hours it was back up to 300 so I figured it was due to the temperature dropping over night.\n\nFiring this one up was such a relief as it worked perfectly.\n\n# Things that went wrong and things I'd have done differently\n\nI made plenty of mistakes on this install, but none that cuased any real issues (yet \ud83d\ude05).\n\nBuying 5/16\" instead of 1/4\" I blindly followed the guides I found, not realizing that some units use 5/16\" and some 1/4\" so I ended up buying things I didn't need.\n\nTape up before pulling line set I definitely wished I had taped up the lineset with duct tape before pulling it through the crawlspace. I had to patch some broken insulation that wouldn't have been needed if I had taped it, oh well.\n\nNot measuring more carefully I measured the lineset to 34' but the last marker went inside the wall, I wish I had taken care more carefully to mark it out before.\n\nOver Charging Obviously, over charging was really bad (not the end of the world but still). This was due to me rushing, I should have tripple checked my calculation.\n\nLeaving linesets too long I left some of the linesets a bit too long as I fully expected to have to redo some flares. I wish I had been a bit braver but in the end this isn't a big deal.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nOverall this was a fun project. I learned a lot of new things, I got cool new tools and I sense of pride. I want to be very clear that I don't consider myself a professional. People go to school to learn this and it's extremely complicated. But I don't have to know everything, just enough to install the system. The project took about 3.5 months of weekend work and afternoon work, bit by bit. The biggest challenge was trying to learn without even knowing what I didn't know, I definitely have a newfound respect for the trades.\n\nI don't know if I would recommend this to anyone but if you like learning things and is reasonbly handy, this can be a cool project.\n\nIn total I spent around $8,000 that was broken down like this:\n\n* Units - $3,728\n* Tools - $1415\n* Supplies - $1941\n* EPA 608 License - $60 (for the physical card as support for Skillcat)\n* Electrician - $700\n\nSo I ended up saving somewhere between $6K and $8K, that's a lot of beer money.\n\nFor now the system works great but we'll see how it works in the long run. I'm sure I could have done things differently but I've also seen worse installs (let the critique rain).\n\nRegarding warranty. Mitsubishi states you only receive warranty if installed by a licensed installer according to the manual. Where I live all that's needed is an EPA license so I'm hoping they'd honor the warranty but time will tell, I'm not counting on it though.\n\nThanks for reading and I hope this inspires you!\n\n# Sources\n\nHere are some of the things I learned to help me.

    "text": "Digging and burying a fence post in Northern Ontario\n\nI'm researching methods on how to bury a fence post strong enough to hold a wooden gate and I've curious what works well in Northern Ontario climates (Sudbury).\n\nI understand our frost line is 4-6' deep and I \"should\" bury my posts deeper than that - but it's just me digging this hole on a weekend. I have a lot of clay soil and have read mixed messages about whether to put 6\" of gravel at the bottom of the hole for drainage. If I bury a post 3-4' down and use tapered concrete footing like bigfoot or redibase will that really stop the frost from heaving if I'm still above the frost line? How sturdy is dry concrete vs. wet concrete vs. foam? I'm getting all sorts of mixed messages about that too.\n\nI'm just curious what everyone's experience is with all of these different methods. For context, I'm burying a 10' 4x4 PT wood post so I have 6' above ground. There would be 2 posts about 3' apart for the gate. In Sudbury, we get all extremes of weather: +30C in the worst of the summer, -30C in the worst of winter with the polar vortex, so frost heave is very prevalent around here. We also get lots of snow so the spring gets pretty soggy.",

    "text": "I need advice on hanging various heavy things on drywall with metal studs\n\nI am in a situation where I need to start mounting some heavy stuff on the walls because I've run out of surfaces to put things on (think TVs, computer monitors, shelves, etc) but all of my walls are drywall mounted to metal studs. I can't drill into the metal studs, so anything I put on the wall has to be mounted to the drywall. I am extremely aware that this is not an ideal situation. I would much prefer to mount into studs, or do any of the various tricks to get a 2x4 in the place where I need it, but that just isn't an option. I tried using Toggler bolts to mount a monitor arm on the wall and the drywall just crumbled around it. Same thing if I use the basic plastic anchors - the drywall just crumbles and leaves a huge hole. All of the advice I've seen posted online says to find a stud and either mount directly to it or use it as an anchor for another anchor system (ex french cleats) but I just straight up don't have accessible studs. Do any of you have ideas on how to get around this? Is there something obvious I'm overlooking?",

You can also mount a sheet of plywood on the face of a wall, screwed into the studs, then attach your various hardware to that plywood so you aren't relying on drywall anchors that can't do the job. \n\nself piercing and self tapping screws for metal studs can take a pretty good load without getting ripped out. They have a very fine thread compared to wood screws, ideal for the metal to metal connection.",

    "text": "Am I a jerk if I fire my contractor at this point?\n\nLong story short, I hired someone to build an addition on my house.  Since then it's been a nightmare.  He is a pretty bad communicator which means there are times he has asked for payments without explaining why.  When I've balked he basically told me it's in our contract without explaining what the payment was for.  I have had to go back and look at the contract multiple times to see exactly what payment was due that he was referencing because he just couldn't or wouldn't tell me.  He has legitimately been owed the money every time but it's still a frustrating experience.  I don't know why he can't just say, \"The contract says I'm owed $X when the walls are up.  The walls are up now so I'm owed $X.\" but he can't for some reason.\n\n  \nI'm also still a bit salty that he left me to pick up all the construction debris claiming it wasn't his job unless I was willing to pay extra.  By debris I'm talking about everything from scrap 2x4s to Taco Bell bags and pizza boxes that were tossed all over the backyard.  I have paid him for the framing job which he claimed was done but a buddy of mine (who frames houses for a living) wanted to look at the progress and pointed out half a dozen things that weren't done yet and told me there is no way I should've paid him.  The house is sheathed and sided but there are still braces up, there are not drywall backers and some of the doors are not fully framed yet.  My contractor said all of these things don't get done 'til the drywall work starts but my buddy said that is not remotely the case.  Additionally, he has asked me to pay his subs directly (which I had never heard of before) and been \\*extremely\\* pushy about payments at times.  My wife and I went out of town over a weekend and the contract said we owed him money after passing an inspection.  We told him we would be out of town over the weekend.  He didn't get the work done and the inspection passed until Friday afternoon and called us demanding immediate payment.  I told him we'd pay him when we got back in town on Monday and he threw a massive fit demanding the payment right then and there and telling us no work could go on over the weekend without that payment.  Told us that we should've left him a post dated check for the amount and he'd only cash it if the inspection passed.  We had to figure out how to pay him while we were on the road because he didn't take Cashapp or Venmo or Apple Pay and that was a giant PITA.  \n\n  \nNow the project is at a sticking point again.  We've passed rough electrical, plumbing and HVAC.  Framing inspection is scheduled for today (though the stuff my buddy pointed out is still not done despite me asking about it).  I've asked about the drywall guys.  His response was to ask me to hang the insulation myself and tell me it would massively delay the project if I didn't so I am now hanging insulation in my addition and being salty about that too.  I asked again yesterday when the ETA was for the drywall guys (I am planning to be done w/the insulation by Friday).  After initially getting no response he finally told me it would be next week but couldn't clarify if that meant Monday or Friday.  He's also indicated that his drywall guys might have moved on to other stuff.  I told him I was considering hanging the drywall myself and finding someone else to finish it and he got upset at that.  Said that would delay things massively.  My wife and I already planned to paint ourselves to save money.  We could do flooring ourselves to save some money too (though work is needed to flatten the floors now and the contractor keeps not doing that).  I found another drywall guy who is actually my brother's neighbor and has done work for him.  Am I a bad person if I consider firing this contractor guy (once he passes the framing inspection) getting someone else to do the drywall and relying on my wife and I to do the rest of the finish work?",

    "text": "Finished my most ambitious DIY project yet! Running a 100A subpanel to my detached garage\n\nHi all!\n\nAfter 34 (calendar) days, 45 hours of labor, and $2676.99 in expenses, I have finally completed my latest DIY project of running a 100A subpanel to my garage. My motivation for this was to better equip my garage for my woodworking projects and to future proof for an EV charger. I have learned so much in the process from this community and creators on YouTube and I wanted to share my experience for anyone looking to tackle a similar project. I'm happy to answer any questions that folks have, but please note that I am not a professional electrician and that this post and my comments are just a reflection of my experience.\n\nHere is the [**Full Project Album with Descriptions**](https://imgur.com/a/DXRKiu9)**.**\n\nFrom a high level, I ran a feeder from my main electrical panel in my home to my detached garage. This required running cable from the panel, down the drywall cavity, and through the crawlspace. From that point, I created a trench across the back of my patio from the house to garage for a Rigid Metal Conduit raceway, spliced the crawlspace cable to those wires, and ran them through the raceway to a box and subpanel in the garage. I was quoted an average of $10,500 (Seattle, WA) from 3 electricians to do this work **excluding** the trenching and installation of the conduit (I never got a quote for this but I'm assuming that would have been at least $5k+). I thought this was super high given the cost of the materials involved, which led me to go the DIY route.\n\n# Lessons Learned:\n\n* **Working with my inspections/permitting office (Seattle, WA) was very straightforward and they folks in that office are extremely helpful.** I got an over-the-counter Electrical permit for this project, and they inspected it two times. First to see that my conduit was the correct depth before it was covered, and second was to inspect everything else as the project was complete.\n* **Absolutely call 811** ([Call Before You Dig](https://call811.com/)). From that call, I learned where my drainage and gas pipes were, which altered my plans but ultimately led to no surprises when digging.\n* I used Copper SER (#3/3/3/5) Cable to run from my main panel through the crawlspace and to the junction box where it was then spliced with THWN-2 (#3 AWG and #6 AWG \\[for ground\\]). Using Aluminum is a more popular option here as it's far cheaper than Copper (although the conductors need to be upsized to a larger gauge).\n* For both the SER and THWN-2 at these larger gauges, they are a bit intimidating to handle if you're used to #12/14 Romex. Fishing them through conduit and even bending them in the panels take a fair amount of force that I wasn't expecting. I was pretty nervous about being forceful with them as I didn't want to cause damage, but I learned that this cable is extremely durable and can handle some significant bending. If you use plenty of wire lube and deburr any conduit cuts, pulling the wire will take some effort but is definitely doable with 2 people.\n* When it comes to the conduit you're using or the gauge of the feeders, **always upsize what you need**. Especially in a DIY scenario, the cost difference for materials is relatively negligible to run things on the larger side, and it might save you from having to re-dig this stuff in the future. The previous owner actually had a 1/2\" PVC conduit running the garage already, but it was too small to support much more than the existing 15A circuit, so I couldn't use it.\n* Overall spend for this project was just shy of $2700, but that includes quite a few tools that I can keep in perpetuity (Rotary hammer drill, wheel barrow, tarp, deburring tool, cable cutters, etc.). That brings my cost of actual materials somewhere closer to $2100. This is still a bit higher than what a skilled electrician would have spent, as they wouldn't need to over-buy wire lengths and probably could have reduced the complexity of my installation.\n\nLike I said, I'd love to share any knowledge I've gained from this with folks on any part of the process! It was an awesome learning experience and I have gained a ton of knowledge in the process.",

    "text": "Crawlspace Humidity- please help!\n\nLet me preface by saying this is going to be a very long post, so thank you very much in advance to anyone who takes the time to read it. \n\nA few important pieces of information about our home:\n-the main part, the section on a crawl space, is 90 years old. \n- we live in central Florida \n- we plan on staying here for the long haul and raising our children here- we are spending the money and time to truly restore the home and use quality, natural materials (hardwood, stone, etc.) I promise we are not replacing things with \u201ccheap\u201d manmade junk to try to turn around and flip it (I\u2019ve spent enough time pouring through posts to know people are quick to jump in and crucify people for \u201cdestroying\u201d the charm and character of old houses) \n\nHere\u2019s the issue: \nApparently, we have a humidity problem in our crawlspace. We had brand new hardwood installed in part of the house just less than a year ago that is already cupping and even cracked in one area. My husband took a humidity gauge under the house and at certain times it read over 80%. We are well aware that that is a problem. \n\nThere is no leak or standing water (or evidence of it) anywhere under the house. My husband has checked (several times) and we\u2019ve had multiple professionals out. We\u2019re being told it\u2019s a circulation issue of the air under the house. Being in central Florida we obviously deal with extreme humidity in general. There is one corner that apparently has basically no ventilation at all. So here are my concerns/questions: \n\n1. There was a different species of wood in that part of the house before. It was original (so roughly 90 years old). It was not cupping or cracked. I\u2019m being told that is likely due to the fact that hardwood installed that long ago was from trees that had likely been growing for a few hundred years before they were ever cut for wood, while wood for flooring today is often from trees that have only been growing a short amount of time because the intended purpose is to grow them for hardwood. So the quality just isn\u2019t what it was nearly 100 years ago. I think I can accept that explanation just based on the quality of nearly everything else available these days. HOWEVER- \n2. We do not have a mold and mildew problem under the house, or at least not yet. My husband has confirmed during his numerous times under the house, but the professionals we had out also confirmed. So while I can accept the floor explanation, it does not make sense to me that if this were not a fairly recent problem that we wouldn\u2019t have a mold and mildew problem if it\u2019s reaching over 80% humidity. We have not talked to a single neighbor with this issue, and all of our houses are on crawl spaces. \n3. We received two quotes for encapsulation (the plastic lining, dehumidifier, and sump pump). Both were 20k-25k for roughly 1000 sq ft. We do not need any remediation nor is there any debris or insulation that needs to be cleared. \n4. Considering we do not need remediation or any removal of anything, I do not see why we can\u2019t pay a handyman to attach the lining and then pay a professional just to install the dehumidifier and sump pump. I\u2019ve read several threads on here of people doing it themselves. \n\nSo specifically- \n1. Does it sound like there\u2019s something else going on besides general humidity and lack of proper ventilation? If so, what else should we be investigating since there are no leaks or water issues? \n2. Does the quote seem high for what we need done (I know this is tough to answer considering it differs based on where you\u2019re located- we\u2019re in a large town but it is not one of the main cities in central Fl) \n3. Is having a handyman install the lining a perfectly legitimate idea, an acceptable idea, or a terrible idea? \n\nAny other advice? \n\nIf you made it through all of this, thank you again. Just trying to do this house justice, keep our family in a safe environment, and stop hemorrhaging money.",

    "text": "New to Reddit: Entire Kitchen Remodel\n\nHi all, like the title says I am new to Reddit this is my 2nd time posting this thread since the first one was removed. I guess I wasn't thorough enough in my first post since I have more time today I will be more thorough. This is my first renovation and has taken sometime but, it has come out to be exactly how I envisioned it. To be clear it was a full 2 bed 1 bath reno, that took 2 years every night after work for a few hours per night &amp; long weekends, with ZERO prior home renovation skills. Also, full disclosure I did not do the tile work or counter top a company did that. I designed the layout and picked all materials used and colors. I'm not one to post a lot online but my girlfriend kept telling me I should post it, so here we are.  \nDetails:  \nDemoing: The first thing I did was ditch the drop ceilings taking it from 7' tall ceilings to 9.5' tall, once all the ceiling was removed it was gutting time. All the cabinets came out, old tile was busted up (it was a lot of work for one guy over a couple days). Once it was all gutted it was re-drywalled because the dry wall it had was in very rough shape. After it was all re-drywalled I decide to add crown molding (I decided to put it in every other room so I figured the kitchen needed it too) IMO it was worth the extra $$$ and it being a pain in the butt to install it looks extremely nice and adds height to the kitchen. Also, I opened up the wall with my girlfriend's dad (a structural engineer) where the stove use to be to allow for bar to be installed, this really helped make the kitchen feel bigger. Lucky there was nothing structural about the wall so we were able to add this opening pretty easily.  \n\n\nCabinets: While I was demoing the kitchen I kept an eye out for used cabinets that were actually good ones not the cheap pressed wood ones, I found a full set of Merillat Cabinets in a wealthy neighborhood on craigslist (lady was remodeling a rental and said they weren't nice enough spoiler alert they were very nice) they were dark stained wood  I ended up sanding them, priming them with Kilz primer and painting them with valspar paint. This was all done on the nights that I decided that I didn't feel like busting up the kitchen, in my uncles garage. I would estimate the cabinets to cost about $1000-1500 if you count my labor as $0. The sanding and priming took a lot of time because I wanted it done correctly. I was able to save a lot by reusing the rubbed bronze hardware that they came with. When it came time to install the cabinets I found I had an issue I had not figured the swing of the cabinet doors correctly and the layout I had planned would not work so I had to get creative and move some cabinets around on my plans. What resulted was me making a custom wine rack to fill a void that would have looked silly if not filled and having a family friend shorten the cabinet next to the wine rack for me. It all turned out well but for a while I was really worried that I wasted the money on cabinets I couldn't use. Let that be a lesson lol measure twice buy once! I decided not to do hanging cabinets and went with floating shelves that I made non-floating by attaching the brackets to them to ensure that they would not fall.  \nAppliances: Stainless everything (Kitchen-Aid Microwave, Haier Fridge, Fridgeaire Stove) All of which was brand new. I was able to score the fridge for 75% off at a local home depot because it was a special order return and it had been sitting on their floor for a while. The Microwave and Stove came from Best Buy both of which were discount because they were putting new models out plus the store was getting renovated; TBH I have no idea what the difference was between the microwave I got and the new model nothing appeared to be different at all, I wasn't complaining though they were both marked down I want to say 50% if I remember correctly. Basically the stove with the discount cost what an entry level stainless stove would have regularly cost at Home Depot. I decided not to install a dishwasher because it would eliminate a cabinet that was needed for storage. My figuring was if someone bought this place they would probably be a 3 person or less household so if you are too lazy to do dishes for 3 people or less then you probably shouldn't live here.\n\nCounter tops: Originally I wanted marble that looked like this however after talking to the company that did the counter tops they talked me into buying the Quartz. It cost a little more than marble or granite but, there is zero maintenance to it and that is what sold me on it. Counter tops cost roughly $3000 if I remember correctly, that is including a new sink and 4\" back splash all the way around\n\nTile work and back splash: Tile came from Home Depot and Glass Back splash was a craigslist find about an hour and a half from my location it was worth the drive. It was in a wealthy area and the wife decided she didn't like it after they bought $1200 worth of it and they didn't want to take it back so the husband listed it on Craigslist for cheap I bought what I needed for $12-14 per sheet  (Retail was $25-30 per sheet). Floor Tile was nothing too crazy just some home depot tile, I just wanted something to hide dirt. I honestly cannot remember the cost on it I would guess about for all of it probably around $650 plus grout.  \nI was able to find a pretty good deal on ebay for a new rubbed bronze faucet I think it was around $150 or so  \nI'm sure that I am forgetting a lot please ask if you have questions. Also, I tried to estimate all costs however they are simply that I still need to sit down and tally up all the receipts.  \nIf people end up liking this I can post more of the other rooms I have renovated now that the house is completely finished.  \nThanks  \nDrunkBagels\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/6C5pUa2](https://imgur.com/a/6C5pUa2)",

    "text": "A first timer's guide for first timer's who are considering refinishing their hardwood floors.\n\nI bought a house about a year ago and had a couple rooms with bad floors. The statistic I'd seen (but never got quoted) was $4 per square foot to refinish a wood floor. So for the rooms I was looking at, it was going to be about $1000-1600 each. \n\nThe important thing is to know that your floors are going to look significantly better really no mater what you do. They're going to be fresh and shiny. I made mistakes on mine like not removing the baseboards (i think I may have gone crazy if I'd added that) but I saved a ton of money redoing mine myself and we hadn't moved in yet so that helped make dust matter less.\n\nSo here's a guide I probably should have made when I learned everything I could and did mine myself.\n\nFirst, You'll need sanders. I recommend:\n-Random Orbital Floor Sander (This is the slowest, dummy proof way. There are also Orbital Floor sanders which are round and spin to sand away, but can cause pigtails on the floor which are apparently noticeable/undesirable. Then there are drum sanders, the fastest way to either sand a floor well or ruin your floor. These are the sanders people are talking about when they're like \"start in a corner and see if you can handle this\". You seem to have plenty of wood to work with, by which I mean the top segment of your flooring is thick enough to sand. It looks like it's as thick as the interlocking middle and the bottom, so they've maybe never been refinished in any serious way which is good for you. These are easy to rent from Home Depot for cheaper, but understand you're going to be devoting a lot of time to this. Make sure you don't have anything else going on and understand that you'll be unable to go onto the floor after it's \"finished\" for a certain amount of time to allow it to cure.\n\n-Edge floor sander- [Look at this link](http://howtosandafloor.com/how-to-use-an-edge-floor-sander/) to get an idea of what I'm talking about. In my naivety, I thought a floor sander for the middle and a handheld sander for the sides. Like... a quarter sheet sander. They're both sanders, right? You need an edge sander. The carpet probably left staples in the floor so take plyers and pull them out, they will spark on the Edge floor sander. And I just checked Home depot for these too, they have two kinds. I used the Clarke and liked it a lot.\n\nThe hard thing here is that this sander is not fool proof, but it's fairly easy to pick up. Essentially, it's a big fast grinder. You get on your knees and you go in a pass, kind of swinging it back and forth. If you have a transition area like a doorway, just tape it off with painters tape or something. Or that's what I did anyway.\n\nMineral Spirits- These are like your replacement for anything you'd use water for in cleaning up a normal mess or cleaning the floors (no water or liquids in the room, especially once you've sanded it! I was super cautious about this since I think I read that the wood grain is pretty exposed right now. The mineral spirits are also how you'll help clean off sawdust. [this guide seems good for the cleaning process](http://www.minwax.com/pdfs/minwax-how-to-refinish-your-hardwood-floors.pdf).\n\n-Rags. Lots of rags.\n\n-A mop handle, to go with your special bottoms for spreading out the floor sealer.\n\n-special mop bottoms for spreading out the floor sealer. I used 100% lambswool applicators. You may also need to buy a **t-bar** if it doesn't come with one. This type of applicator pairs will oil-modified polyurethane. [see this guide](http://www.finehomebuilding.com/2008/06/30/whats-the-difference-floor-finish-applicators). But mostly I think if you use a roller, you're more likely to have bubbles. The lambs wool will shed. There are also guides online for keeping the hairs from falling out into the sealer, but honestly you're not going to notice. try to get hairs out before you start and then just do it. I would see hairs when the room was empty and I was done and it was freshly shiny. Then I never saw them again.\n\n-Finish. There are lots of these. I was recommended Poloplaz Supreme Sealer. It was pricier maybe, and I had to go to a special flooring shop to buy some, and lie a little bit. The place was for contractors only, so they were literally telling me, \"Fine, we will take this easy sell, but we aren't going to teach you how to redo your floors. We don't really have time and this is not the place for it\"\n\nShoe covers- if you are trying to get your floor into great shape before you seal it, don't track dirt or water onto the floor. these are good. Buy too many.\n\nScrap carpeting- This is one thing I ended up using a lot. That freshly sanded floor you don't want to get anything onto before it's sealed? Okay, where do you set the drippy bucket or bottles of stuff while in the room? Or even outside of the room. That super thick polymer coating, do you want it anywhere but freshly applied to the floor? I found some crap rugs that came with the house worked will for this because I didn't care about them. That being said, if spills happen, catch them early and use mineral spirits to clean them up with a rag.\n\n-Buy a big bag or rags. You'll use them on something over time.\n\n-Safety glasses! I used regular ones but [these ones](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01A12J3GI/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) would probably work even better and are similarly cheap. Oh yes, There will be dust.\n\n-safety mask. I used a cheapo one and have a beard, it probably wasn't the best. I don't know if you have a beard but if not, a half mask [like this](https://smile.amazon.com/3M-Facepiece-Respirator-6291-Particulate/dp/B000FTEDMM/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1510586760&amp;sr=8-12&amp;keywords=3m+mask+filter) or [this](https://smile.amazon.com/3M-Facepiece-Respirator-Respiratory-Protection/dp/B00AR63G12/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1510586760&amp;sr=8-11&amp;keywords=3m+mask+filter).\n\nIf you do have a beard, this is pretty awesome and I've just discovered it. and can be used for anything dusty/moldy you do in the future. [works like scuba](https://smile.amazon.com/Resp-O-Rator-Dust-Respirator-Model-JR-7/dp/B002KA0CMO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1510586882&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=resp-o-rator). The cheaper one in front of the mouth apparently can apparently get damp after a few hours, which this task will definitely take.\n\n-On the topic of Stain. Do not stain. The sealer will add the color you think you want. The stain will be darker, harder to apply well (if at all), easier for mess ups, and accentuate flaws. If you just want your standard, normal gorgeous floors stick to sealer only. Once you've sanded and are working on cleaning the wood dust up, you'll be \"washing\" the floor with some mineral spirits and this will actually show you what your floor may look like afterward. It's going to be surprising and satisfying. If you're still stuck on stain, read this [to make sure you understand terms](https://www.peteshardwoodfloors.com/Wood-Floor-Techniques-101/let-me-talk-you-out-of-staining-your-floor.html) and then go read guides for it. \n\n-Tack rags. These sticky rags are made specifically for taking dust off the floor. DO NOT USE THEM. A lot of guides will either not mention them or say not to use them. Instead, clean your floors with mineral spirit rags and lint free rags. Some even say microfiber clothes. So be it. But avoid the sticky ones. If you don't want to get anything onto your floors once they are exposed and sanded, don't wipe them down with glue paper. Cuz they'll get glue on them.\n\n-A really good vacuum. Shop vacs probably not good enough, or mine wasn't. I borrowed a vacuum from a neighbor fortunately. It had a big metal pipe and a rolling cannister and it was extremely strong and could suck dust up from between boards. This is going to make a difference since dust can hurt the adhesion steps.\n\n-Hardwood floor scrapers- [This is the one I found for sale, but the ones i had were just made of wood and honestly looked really shitty. They were just a piece of wood with a sharp, right angle blade on the end for scraping crap off the floor.](https://smile.amazon.com/Warner-10016-Triangle-Carbide-Replacement/dp/B00O5GG1KI/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1510592837&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=carbide+floor+scraper) These I think end up being more useful if you have things in your floors like pipes or if you have already got a finish on your floor. I don't think you have that, but there should hopefully be some cheaper than this thing on amazon. I didn't really use it but in the corners of your room either go with a quarter sheet sander or these for the first layers perhaps. Carbide hardwood floor scrapers... yea.\n\n-Sanding pads every sander you use will have a unique sanding pad it will need. They will need to have a range of grits to work your way from sanding up the crap, and then slowly working your way to higher and higher grits. [this guide walks through what this means](https://www.peteshardwoodfloors.com/Wood-Floor-Techniques-101/the-sanding-process.html). Make a judgement about your floors. I didn't use a pole sander and instead just got as close to the wall as i could with the random orbital. Also, when I went to home depot they said I could always just return unused sanding papers so definitely over-buy these. Once I found my rhythm, I found that the 400 square foot room took several pads for each pass. But honestly, initially, it was hard to tell if anything was even happening. It's a slow process.\n\n-tape/tacks and polytarp- the dust is going to be everywhere and on everything. Cover your outlets and vents.Cover the door as best you can. Maybe even cover the next doors. \n\nThe guide part:\n\nI've probably forgotten something you need, but I'll try to call things out as I go. So first of all, tape off your room. Tape it extra well. I had a lot of trouble getting painters tape to stick and used tacks as well. Do whatever you need to do. But know that the super fine dust is going to coat everything. It will be on the wall itself afterward. \n\nRemove your floor molding if you're going to. I didn't do this, and the front of some of mine look sanded and have floor sealer on them. I also never really notice and was going to redo them eventually anyway. But now I don't have floor sealer under them so if I replace or repair them, they just need to go back and cover those spots. In other words, your floor goes to the WALL but the molding covers the edges. I didn't do this step and may come to regret it but it's one more thing you'll need to pull of and put back on which is fine. The websites have a guide for numbering these so you can find where they all go afterwards when you nail them back in. [this one discusses numbering moldings](http://www.minwax.com/pdfs/minwax-how-to-refinish-your-hardwood-floors.pdf)\n\nDetermine where you're at in the floor process. How much grit do you need to start? It's likely 36-40, but read the guides above. Honestly, read a ton about the websites and get a feel for the process. Start sanding! Just remember, the random orbital sander is foolproof. You're not going to sand a hole in your floor, you're not going to get the pigtail swirls. It takes longer but you just keep moving it and wait to see changes. Check your sanding pads every 20-30 minutes at the start and get a feel for how often you should be swapping them out. This took a day and a half for us not knowing what we were doing. Wipe the floor up and vacuum between each pass. I think we did a couple passes at 36 or 40 grit to make sure we were doing a good job and because of the flaws we were trying to remove.\n\nVacuum well and move up to 60 and 80 and 100. It goes faster but can be hard to tell youre advancing sometimes. Just listen to music or podcasts (just realized I forgot hearing protection) [this is what i got](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00CPCHBCQ/ref=twister_B06Y3YSCSF?_encoding=UTF8&amp;th=1). I do earbuds under the hearing protection but have no idea if that's a bad idea. Seems better than nothing.\n\nAnyway. Sand the floor and sand the edges with the edge floor sander. Do a final pass over it at 100 grit to make sure it's as even as it's going to be. I see a comment from CharliesMaster that this could be a softwood floor vs hardwood. I am not certain how that would affect the sanding, but the random orbital floor sander is the slow and steady method to go with. Try to be conscious of how long you stay in one spot, especially with the floor edge sander. Also, pine may have more/different nails, so do some research about how to countersink these so that the sanders don't encounter them! If you have pine.\n\nOnce you're done with the sanding part, your floors are going to feel smoother to the touch. Once you're at 100 grit, you're not really taking as much material off, you're just taking the cuts out of the 80 grit pass (just as 80 is mostly for taking the 60 grit cuts out, and so on). The majority of material removal happens at the lower, rougher grits. So try to check that it's uniform and ready for Phase 2.\n\nCLEAN! You need to clean the floors up good. Wash them with the mineral spirits on a rag. I did this by hand because I lacked supplies and experience and it gave me an idea of where I was. The suped up vacuum is invaluable here, but just don't think you can use an everyday vacuum and be conscientious of how much dust is left and you should be alright. There's a lot of dust produced in this whole sanding step so do it several times and give it time to settle a bit between cleanings. Mineral spirits are going to give you an idea of what your wood will look like and they dry out quickly so just use it(and lint free rags) and get it close.\n\nAfter your floors are super clean, you'll ready to apply the sealer. This was actually one of the hardest steps. The time-frame required to allow the sealer to set, while not letting it set too long, is odd. Booties are a must here. You don't want your shoe in the sealer and you don't want the sealer on your shoe. Also, scrap carpet for setting stuff down (or tarp. I don't know, the carpet seems good) but the last thing you want is for the polyurethane sealer to get somewhere you don't want it. Follow the guides for getting your lambswool applicators as clean as you can (the new ones will have loose hairs). But know that you are going to get stuff stuck onto your floor. I kind of just started. There are some guides in the links I've posted so far about how best to apply this so read up, but essentially you just don't want to end up with too much or not enough. I tried to push it around in the direction of my wood and sort of paint yourself into a corner where that corner is your door. Apply it evenly. I think you don't want to try to wring the last bits out of the applicator by pressing down, and you don't want to rush it. Let it cure and set how it will, but not all the way. [Read this for cleaning](https://www.peteshardwoodfloors.com/Wood-Floor-Techniques-101/final-steps-cleaning-up-and-applying-finish.html) and  [DEFINITELY READ THIS](https://www.peteshardwoodfloors.com/Wood-Floor-Techniques-101/how-to-apply-poly.html) for applying. I know I said I used Poloplaz but the oil based polyurethane I think is the way to go. Or I did after a lot of research a year ago when I did this. This site recommends Duraseal, which you won't need to go to a specialty store for and will probably look the same. Your call. I also don't remember if I did the two different types they recommend here but I don't think I did.... \n\nEdit: I think they say one can will do about 400 square feet and that was true for me. I had left over. Better too much than not enough. If you're doing a larger area than about 400 square feet, I think you're supposed to mix them together to avoid having differences between batches.\n\nEssentially, you're putting this polymer down and it's going to go through phases. First, it's going to be pretty wet and sticky and flowing. Then it'll dry over a bit. You'll need airflow to the room because it's going to be giving off a LOT of chemical fumes. If you left it to sit long enough, it'll be completely done, but like painting a wall, you're going to want more than one layer. So before it's too late but after a certain amount of time [RELEVANT GUIDE](https://www.peteshardwoodfloors.com/Wood-Floor-Techniques-101/how-to-apply-poly.html) you'll resand the floors. The polyurethane is basically going to turn white as you flake it up and rough up the surface. If I remember correctly, I was super nervous and did this step with a handheld random orbital sander. I wanted to start building woodworking supplies anyway so I wasn't too bummed about buying this part, but yea. Just know that you're not ruining that nice gloss on your floors, you're giving the next layer something to grab on to. And you're going to do it again. And the guide says \"poor a 5 inch puddle along the wall\", Just saying I used like the pain roller tins they sell and that worked fine. I think I also just bought a big 5 gallon bucket and dipped it as well. This worked best because the tins felt spilly and weren't as stable.\n\nONE THING I recommend doing at this point is to like MAKE A CALENDAR SCHEDULE. It's going to be a weird time frame to, every 4 hours, be resanding the floor and reapplying. Because if you reapply twice, then that's going to be an 8-10 hour process. Did you start at noon like I did? Because you're going to be finishing late. Which is fine and I love my floors but get a schedule down so you're prepared for when it's going to start and end. The grit for resanding the in between layers is pretty high compared to the wood steps, I think I used 220 with my random orbital hand sander. [this guide seems to say you don't need to do sandings in between but I don't know if I believe that](http://www.minwax.com/pdfs/minwax-how-to-refinish-your-hardwood-floors.pdf). For the record it also points out you don't want furniture  on the floor for 72 hours and 1-2 weeks before rugs should go on. It's all about letting the chemicals that are going to vaporize out of the sealer to get out.\n\nI may be off track but okay, so you've applied your first layer of oil based poly and let it skin over and it's been 4 hours and you get your shoe covers on and it doesn't seem to stick to you. You are probably ready to sand it up a bit before your next application. Just get a nice even sanding. I didn't try to get the whole room one even shade or anything, I just made sure every area got touched. You'll see hairs and stuff stuck in the finish. Maybe even a beetle from the windows being open like I had (I even had screens in =\\) but that's okay. Just pick stuff out, sand, clean as best you can and get ready to apply your next layer. You'll basically do this two more times for the oil based. Then you wait a long long time for it to be ready to take furniture on to. I think I even waited a little longer because I was paranoid. Again, from everything I've read, it's really bad to put rugs down but big heavy furniture at least needs those 3 days.\n\nAlso for the record, I did my floors in the summer so it was hot and humid. This process can be different in the winter and I'd encourage you to read about those differences and what can be done. [this blog is seriously useful](https://www.peteshardwoodfloors.com/Wood-Floor-Techniques-101/coating-floors-in-winter.html) and was one of my best resources in all of this. If you have any questions let me know.\n\nWhat would I have done differently? I'd have tried removing my baseboards MAYBE. It was already a lot of work for 1.5 people (enlisted some help on sanding since it's foolproof with the random orbital floor sander, but the applicator and finishing steps were all mine). I'd have started earlier in the day for applying the finish. Once you start you kind of have to keep after it. If your time frame isn't exactly 4 hours, don't worry. Just look at guides and how cured/skinned/whatever your floor seems and don't let it go 12 hours or a day or whatever. \n\nWhat was I happy with 6 months and a year later? Well I will every once in a while notice that the baseboards of mine that were white look like shit but honestly this old house is a work in progress and I'll eventually either restain/refinish the baseboards so they're not painted or make new ones as a project. If you choose to remove baseboards, it'll probably be a cleaner process if you ever do things like that but this \"first time guide\" for first timers didn't include that. I don't think it's super complicated to pull off baseboards, but I think they can crack and so do your research on that step and buy the right tools. I'm particularly happy with the way my floors look. They look freaking amazing. Is there applicator wool stuck in them? yes. Can I tell 99% of the time? No. Does it look like there are errors in my wood floors? honestly, not really. They looked like garbage before. Odd light and dark areas, water damage and spills galore. Were they ever finished? Who knows. But they look gorgeous now, and that's the main take away. \n\nYou also say you want to preserve the current color. Not going to happen. You're going to sand it down and replace the color. But the oil based polyurethane will add color back. It'll look good. Try to find out what kind of wood you have and maybe there's a guide somewhere for what different woods will look like with finish on them. At least for mine, my floors got sanded down and looked almost like plywood or two by fours; in other words, very plain. But washing it with mineral spirits gave hints as to what it would look like, which is really good. And the Finish going on really makes it look good.\n\nThis process is going to be time consuming and tiring. More than you're probably going to give it credit for, even with this disclaimer. It's a 2 day process for a 400 square foot room if you do nothing but sand and apply finish and have all your supplies lined up ahead of time. That doesn't include rechecking guides and double guessing yourself. But you know what else? It is like $1000-1600 to pay someone to do it and it isn't like a \"must have\" for the quality of your house. Your floor looks old but it's still fulfilling it's function as a floor. It's not a gaping hole in your wall. I dunno. It was worth it to me to save the money if I know I can't *really* ruin it. A lot like raising a puppy. You remember your dog how it will be but potty training can feel like a special part of hell. But you get through it. Just take your time.\n\nFor an idea of the cost difference for this, I think I spent about $150 of floor sealer cans for the Poloplaz, maybe $200 total. The floor sander is Random orbital floor sander is $62 a day at my home depot or $248 for a week (ps, I'm not sure Lowes rents tools. Felt dumb trying to ask around for that). \n\nThe floor edger is $43 a day.\n\nThe hand sanders are each about $15 a day (that's for a quarter sheet sander for corners and an orbital for sanding the finish, but i think new ones are like $50-70 bucks each so reconditioned ones are probably cheaper and again, I was going to want some for down the road anyway. I probably spent under $1000 total, but over $500 maybe. And I had two 400 square foot rooms that I did so potentially saved $2000 or so.\n\nI'm not trying to scare you into doing it yourself, just get a quote if you want to and otherwise plan it out in excel or something what you're going to buy and how long it'll take.\n\nWell I guess this is enough of a ramble. Let me know if you have any questions while I try to find the photos of when I did my floor.",

I've made a great start with my email inboxes and reduced the number of emails from \\~9500 to under \\~3500 (but still working on further decreasing the number).\n\nThe next project I'd like to tackle is my Bookmarks folder; I have thousands of links, maybe around 3000 or so. Some time ago I tried to create an organization system with folders and sub-folders, and they are filled with maybe 500 of those Bookmarks. (Note: I'm no longer saving links because when I do it's to save something to \"read later\" -- which rarely happens, so I promptly forget about the link.) But there are still so many links to organize and I find it extremely daunting and anxiety-inducing, which I know sounds ridiculous, but I do get anxious and indecisive and flustered, so then I quit.\n\nI would really love to hear your advice on how I can tackle this project, if you can help me, please!

    "text": "Shed is finally finished!\n\nTLDR: ...it only took 9 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f1acbrmj2ik31.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e4af71e421592615c970056a3e368f436938d70\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/L0E6cUN](https://imgur.com/a/L0E6cUN)\n\nWe've all had those projects that started out planned with excitement, but over time become a running joke or constant reminder that you lack the resources, skills, or time needed to complete what once made you so passionate. I'm telling you, if I can finally complete the worst part of waking up on the weekend you can too. It really doesn't matter how long it takes. The feeling of completing a project after years of procrastination, lack of time, or even hard times is even more exhilarating than completing a project on time and under budget. You can finish it.\n\nOctober, 2009. I purchased my first starter home in a new neighborhood under development while it was only studs. I came by every day after work to check out the progress, pick out colors, decide on tile, etc., but most importantly, plan landscaping which included my first shed on my own land. I had printed out plans for a [kit from Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Handy-Home-Products-Phoenix-10-ft-x-8-ft-Solar-Shed-with-Floor-Kit-18160-3/100350467) that was half shed and half greenhouse, but unfortunately the 'glass' part was on the 8 foot side of a 8x10 floor kit where i wanted the 'glass' on the 10 foot side of a slab. The house was completed in December 2009 and i moved in. In the months leading up to moving day i had redesigned the home depot shed to suite my needs but retain the same set of building instructions and materials, just dimension changes for walls and trusses (and the addition of anchor bolts).\n\nI had everything i needed to start construction on my dream shed come spring. ...then i met my wife in January. It wasn't her fault, my priorities changed. I did manage to pour the slab in May of 2010 with the help of my future wife as a date sort-of thing. Pouring the slab was the hardest i had ever worked (im a computer guy. i'm handy, but still a computer guy). I ordered a palette of cement bags, rebar, 2 yards of red sand for leveling, and timber for the forms. A friend of mine showed up to help set up the forms and happened to have a laser leveler and had the amazing idea to raise the form to the level of the foundation of my house. I HIGHLY recommend doing this. Every time i've gotten a little bit of flooding in the back yard i'm thankful he had that idea. I rented an electric mixer that fit 2 bags of cement at a time and started pouring.\n\nFor years afterwords i'd pull out the shed plans about once a month, make notations, check prices, make minor changes. The slab ended up becoming a pedestal for our picnic table for cookouts. I felt i didn't have the time, money, or skill set to complete the shed. Family just happens. Our resources were shifted to a wedding, to car repairs, to children. It just happens and years flew by.\n\nPeople would ask about the slab, and i'd have to explain my idea for the shed, sometimes pulling out all my plans and notes to show them. Again the excitement! I knew i'd get to it eventually, but again, things happen and years flew by. Five years later: May 2015: I knew i had a work bonus coming up in June and, as an added bonus, the final house of our planned neighborhood was under construction. I had made friends with the contractor at this point and got the 'ok' to pick their scrap pile. I was able to build the walls and roof trusses to my modified design flat on the floor of my garage for just the cost of a pack of exterior screws. The plan was now to erect the skeleton of the shed and use the work bonus to complete it. That weekend i was able to erect the walls and trusses with the help of my neighbor. The next weekend i was able to add the plywood roof base and cement anchors. I picked a stack of 1x4's for the trim, but it would have to wait until i could purchase the shed paneling.\n\nA week later i got my bonus and picked up a bunch of sheets of shed paneling, roofing fabric, shingles, and roofing tacks. I was able to mount the paneling, the trim, and the shingles that weekend. Also that weekend, the AC coil in my house broke. No more work bonus. The only thing i could afford the next weekend was 1 gallon of white exterior paint to try and protect the skeleton of the shed because i had no idea when i would be able to continue.\n\nThe shed just sat like that with just the trim painted and half exposed for another 4 years. Every time i'd get another bonus, or raise my savings, or get a tax return, or surprise payout from somewhere something bad WOULD happen the SAME weekend. I'm not exaggerating. I'd save up the funds to finish the shed and BOOM, car breaks down ...badly. Next time: my dog gets hit by a truck. Next time: wife trips over the three legged dog and breaks a front tooth in half. Next time: daughter totals the new car. (all of these happened, all at when i was planning to finish the shed, all of which cost thousands of dollars) It became a running joke in my family. \"Do you think our house would ever burn down?\" \"About the same time i'm ready to finish my shed...\" My wife and i were literally scared to receive a lump of money because it always ended badly.\n\nWell i was able to eventually finish my shed. Here's how it happened. June 2019: My office got a new contract for a large installation and the customers were really demanding. They wanted all the work done in 30 days. I rode with the sales team (I being lead engineer) to meet with the new customer. On the 45 minute drive my boss asked about my shed. I explained everything that was going wrong whenever i was ready to finish it and how it haunted my dreams. He told me, \"If you can get this done on time, i'll give you a bonus to finish your shed.\" Immediately i was petrified. \"You can't do that!\" i said. \"Something bad WILL HAPPEN!\" He changed his tactic to \"Alright, i'll buy everything you need to finish your shed if you can get this project done in 30 days.\" Alright, that works. We shook on it.\n\nJuly 2019: Work project done. I knew a LOT of the wood on the exposed side was rotten. Had the boss-man order me a lot of extra 2x4's to graft into good pieces and replace the rot. Along with this was all the pieces i needed to complete my shed. This included [sheet plexi](https://www.homedepot.com/p/LEXAN-Thermoclear-48-in-x-96-in-x-1-4-in-Clear-Multiwall-Polycarbonate-Sheet-PCTW4896-6MMCL/205202473), [foam strips](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Frost-King-E-O-1-1-4-in-x-7-16-in-x-10-ft-White-High-Density-Rubber-Foam-Weatherstrip-Tape-R516WH/100119011) for supporting the plexi off the wood roof trusses, [mounting bolts](https://www.homedepot.com/p/2-in-Fastener-for-16mm-Thermoclear-Multiwall-Sheet-85190128/206935863), more 1x4 trim, paint, silicone calk, acrylic calk, wood filler, [plexi sheet connectors](https://www.homedepot.com/p/2-in-x-96-in-x-5-8-in-Thermoclear-Polycarbonate-Multi-Wall-H-Channel-PCTWH-16MM/205202545), flashing, drip edge, quarter round for window trim, more shed paneling, plywood (to build my own door), door hinges, latches, door handle, simple vent covers, and probably other stuff i can't remember right now. Completing this shed was always on my mind, and every month i'd go asses the weather damage and keep a running list in my head of what i would need to complete it. So when it was time to square up with my boss's offer i was ready. A week later a flat bed showed up at my house with more than everything i needed. I started by ripping away all the rotted wood and carefully grafting in good wood. I painted the finished grafts to seal them from the elements with high quality exterior paint and primer.\n\nAugust 2019: I cut the 4'x8' plexi into 2' strips and used the connectors to assemble them into a 10'x7' sheet that slid directly into place with the seams centered on the roof trusses. i lay'd a bead of construction adhesive on the bottom inch of the sheet and bolted in the 3\"x3\" drip edge at the bottom. i sealed the edge with silicone calk. With a left over strip of 2' wide plexi, i cut and mounted a window on the far side opposite the door and trimmed it with quarter round (sealing it with silicone calk). A storm was coming so i quickly had to mount the side flashing/drip edge and seal it before the rain. My shed was now covered!! The next weekend i fabricated a door. I cut the plywood to shape and covered it with wood paneling adhered with construction adhesive. i framed it with 1x4 trip and screwed it all together. I painted the trim for protection until i could get to the main paint. I mounted the door against 1\"x1\" door jams that i nailed into place. i attached the door hardware. My shed was now totally sealed.\n\nSeptember 1st-3rd, 2019: Paint and vents. done.\n\nIts still hard to believe it's finished. It took so much out of me for the past 9 years that i still wake up feeling like there's something i'm supposed to be planning, but for the first time i can walk out back in with my coffee and realize i don't have anything to do (as far as the shed is concerned). Sorry for the long post, i'm just extremely overcome with the feeling of accomplishment. We plan on starting plugs in the greenhouse this spring and transplanting them in our new garden. :)",

    "text": "Made A 3D Printer Enclosure\n\nI bought the Neptune 4 Max, which is an absolutely massive 3D printer and doesn't really have a good enclosure available on the market. I could have paid for a custom one, but I decided to just go ahead and make one myself. I figured if I was going to make it myself, I could make it with all the desired bells and whistles.\n\n# The Problem\n\nMy apartment isn't air conditioned, so controlling for temperature and humidity without an enclosure would be impossible. It was also clear that the printer gets HOT, and given the lack of air conditioning, that just kind of made the living room unbearable because it was like being next to a giant space heater.\n\n3D printing without an enclosure is also just generally not wise for one's health. If you plan to print regularly, and the printer is adjacent to a desktop/workstation you sit at most of the day, you're most likely to experience negative effects from constant exposure. I don't plan to print super-toxic filaments like ABS or ASA, but I still didn't want to constantly breathe in all the microplastic particles and VOCs that would be given off by PLA and PETG.\n\nSo I needed the enclosure to allow for temperature control, humidity control, minimize drafts, thermally insulate \\*me\\* from the printer, and allow me to set up an exhaust system with a filter that runs through a HEPA 13 and charcoal filter before exhausting out the window. I wanted the printer's control panel to be accessible outside the enclosure and I wanted to also be able to set up a WYZE cam to record and monitor the printer from elsewhere. And I wanted all this stuff set up without wires spilling out every which way.\n\n# The Build\n\nI first started by assembling the frame for the enclosure. Because the printer is a bedslinger, that means the bed moves front and back-- so even though the printer is \"only\" 24.8 inches deep, the bed actually goes about 5 inches forward and back at its maximum, which adds another 10 inches, so I made sure the enclosure was 35.5 inches deep (yes, I was cutting it pretty close!). The printer is 29 inches high, but that doesn't account for the spool, so I made it 41 inches tall to ensure plenty of breathing room for the filament to unravel. It is 25.9\" wide, including the gantry, but the base without the gantry is actually just over 21\". Remember this-- that will be important later.\n\nThe final build volume of my enclosure came out to 27\" wide x 35.5\" deep x 41.5\" high.\n\n# The Frame\n\nI didn't want to spend a fortune on lumber, which is not only expensive, but very heavy. So I decided to use picture frames. Picture frames ARE usually expensive-- except when people have frames they no longer want or need, and are desperate to get rid of them. So I hopped onto craigslist to see if anyone was selling large picture frames for cheap, and I hit the [MOTHERLODE](https://imgur.com/W7Y7rru). A local picture framing store was selling \"damaged\" or otherwise unsellable frames for $1 apiece!\n\n(Shoutout to CR Framing in Brentwood, CA! If you need some wood for a project and live near Brentwood, this place will happily stock you up. Otherwise, go on Craigslist and see if any framing stores near you are offering a similar deal, that's how I found him).\n\nCR Framing also gave me scrap glass for free-- the stuff that's chipped or scratched or came the wrong size and can't be used-- so I was able to cut my own glass panels for everything but the front door.\n\nUsing picture frames worked exceptionally well because the frames are lightweight and everything was already square and plumb. That saved me a LOT of work. I stacked the picture frames together, screwed and glued, and used steel joints [to reinforce the weaker parts](https://imgur.com/A8fWgxB) like the corners. I [sawed frames into pieces](https://imgur.com/iTXnoGz) to build up to the height I wanted. I also used the steel joining plates on the thin slats of hobby wood I used for the top, to bind them together neatly and securely. I always had my trusty little bubble level on hand so that I could check everything was as level as possible while assembling the frame.\n\n# The Floor\n\nFor the floor, I went to Home Depot's flooring aisle and picked up some tongue-and-groove pieces that kind of just fit together like jigsaw puzzle pieces. Some of them were already pre-cut to the length I needed, so I only had to do a little sawing on the others. There's a lot of damaged boxes in that aisle because people are animals and will rip boxes open and just take out the pieces they want. So I went to an employee and asked if I could get a discount on one of the damaged boxes, [and he gave it to me for forty buck](https://imgur.com/Wp29XAH)s! The flooring was normally $100 a box. And it was almost the exact amount of wood I needed, with very little leftover, so I effectively wound up paying for just the amount I required. Serendipity!\n\n[This](https://imgur.com/2UK8DMR) is what the flooring looked like before I installed it.\n\nI also decided to add a pair of platform rails to support the printer. I realized dragging the printer across the insulation would tear it up, so I set up a pair of elevated walnut boards. I got the boards from Home Depot, but I was quite selective about it. I took each board out and laid it flat on the floor, to see if it was warped-- if it lifted off the ground, if I could see the gap between the board and the floor, it was not flat, and I needed \\*flat\\*.\n\nOnly one of the walnut boards I found was perfectly straight. The second board I chose was straight along most of the plank, but had a but of a warp in the last 20% of the board with a knot in it. This was fine, because the board was long enough for me to cut the warped and knotted section off, but I was able to negotiate a discount with the employees by demonstrating that the board was \\*visibly\\* warped at the end and the knot had actually kind of punched a bit of a hole in it (are you seeing a pattern?).\n\nEven with this careful preparation, I wasn't quite able to get the boards \\*perfectly\\* level on all planes [1](https://imgur.com/vn04Gok) [^(2)](https://imgur.com/1dreWmi). But it was level enough that when I finally installed the printer, I put a little felt pad on the front right foot, and that was enough to make it perfectly and solidly level.\n\nThe installed rails: [HERE](https://imgur.com/lH1jJ77)\n\n# The Walls\n\nI decided to use reflective thermal insulation on the inside of the enclosure and a heat-resistant fabric on the outside. The reflective insulation would not only help keep consistent internal temp within the enclosure, but it would also stop the printer from acting as an undesirable space heater.\n\nThis fabric is NOT fireproof! But it is designed to handle high heat, like what you'd use for oven mitts or an ironing board, and that seemed sufficient for my use case. I used [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091Y1K8C7?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_2) from Amazon and wound up using about 4 yards of fabric.\n\nIf you've ever stretched a canvas for painting before, you'll know that you do it gradually, inch by inch. I applied that technique here, and while the result wasn't perfectly tight, it was [pretty good](https://imgur.com/oguZGUI). I folded down the edges of the fabric and glued it in place to square it, since I wasn't able to cut long strips at a perfect and clean 90 degree angle. That helped keep it looking somewhat neat.\n\nI'd originally intended to use a staple gun, but I'm just not strong enough to press the gun in and get consistent results, so I switched to my trusty loctite. I think all said and done, I used about 8 bottles of loctite for this project, and two bottles of wood glue.\n\n# The Hygrometer Window\n\nMy initial plan had been to use loctite for the hygrometer window, but that failed because the frame for the window had become slightly warped. So I decided to use silicone caulk.\n\nThis was a **mistake.**\n\nI had, in passing, heard tradesmen refer to caulk as \"demon semen\" because it gets everywhere and is impossible to clean off. The name is well-deserved.\n\nI have a WYZE cam in my living room for monitoring my cat, and on reviewing the footage, I was able to watch the disaster that unfolded in my living room. I think I spent an hour sitting on the edge of my tub just trying to wipe silicon off my foot. Fortunately, the living room came out unscathed, because I'd put down towels, plastic cover, etc. to protect it. But my hands and feet? It took hours to really get that stuff off.\n\nThe hygrometer window is caulked, but it is by [no means a professional job](https://imgur.com/LsB811O), and I promptly abandoned that notion for the front door.\n\n\\# The Front Door\n\nI loved the mirror finish on the door so much, I decided not to cover it up and instead took of advantage of it. Especially since it also matched the finish on the hygrometer/thermometer window.\n\nI was originally going to cut a piece of 30\" x 20\" tempered glass to fit the front door... but the glass shattered. My dad and I shared a look-- he'd come over to visit on that day and watch me work-- and I immediately said, \"Change of plans.\" Because when I had that massive piece of broken glass on my card table, I knew I was in over my head. The glass didn't break cleanly on the line I'd scored, but in a wavy pattern. I understand now that **this is how the glass is intended to break**\\-- in wavy patterns, rather than jagged pieces. The glass I'd been cutting for the smaller windows were not tempered glass, and my ignorance meant I had to completely trash a large piece of glass.\n\nI was spooked by how that glass had shattered and decided to go for an acrylic pane instead. But when I received it, I went to lightly brush a piece of plastic thread off of it, and my fingernail scratched it... and I realized it was an utter piece of trash. So I decided to go back to using glass.\n\nI had two options. I could pay for a custom piece of 18 x 22 tempered glass, or I could buy a picture frame that already came with tempered glass cut to that size. I weighed the price difference, and the picture frame won out. So I ordered the picture frame, took out the glass, and installed it in my door. Having learned my lesson with the caulk, I wisely used [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F312K6Q4?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) instead, which results in a very clean look.\n\n# The Filament Door\n\nOne of the benefits of using picture frames is that it was very easy to find [two very nice frames](https://imgur.com/26dWJfc) of [near-identical size](https://imgur.com/AbBp0Ts) to serve as the filament door. You can also see here how I was able to stack two little square frames together and get them perfectly level with the top of the filament door.\n\nI used some of the glass Chris from CR Framing gave me and cut it to size for the door. Cleaned it first, then used loctite to seal it in.\n\nA note about cutting glass: no matter how careful you are, little shards will go flying when you cut it. I was cutting it on an old card table in my living room, and after each cut, I would meticulously vacuum both the table and the floor. I still got a shard in my foot I had to tweezer out. And I also realized this was \\*not\\* going to be a workable solution if I had to sandpaper any of the glass (which I did, along the edges) because doing that would require wet sanding.\n\nI finally figured out the best way to do it was in my kitchen sink. I cleared out all dishes, made sure the counter was clean and unoccupied, and after scoring the glass, I placed the glass under running water as I snapped it in two. This seemed to keep small shards from flying far and I just washed them down into the disposal. The big pieces were easy to dispose in the garbage can right by my side. After, I rinsed and wiped down the sink and counter. When I had to sand the glass, I did it slowly and carefully in that sink, under running water.\n\nI have a new rule in my kitchen: if a piece of food falls into the sink or on the floor, it may as well have fallen into lava. It is considered lost and immediately disposed of. No exceptions.\n\n# The Rear Door (aka THE FUCKUP)\n\nThis is where I almost fucked up everything forever and only scraped by out of sheer luck.\n\nMy original design was to have a door which would allow me to take the printer in and out [from the side](https://imgur.com/xEOD3fZ), and at one point, I actually had it installed as such. [But I didn't like that](https://imgur.com/bwqK8jj), because it would make putting the printer on the rails difficult. So I decided to stick the door in the rear instead.\n\nRemember, the printer is just about 26\" wide with the gantry. The enclosure is 27\" wide. And the door that I used for the rear... was 24\" wide.\n\nHow did I make that fuck-up, you ask? It's because when I was finalizing the door, I didn't measure the printer at its widest point, which is the gantry! I had a brainfart moment and measured its width from the base! This was the moment that almost ruined everything, because no matter how I manipulated the printer, the gantry just would not go through, because there was really no room to turn that corner.\n\nThe solution was to disassemble the gantry. I placed the base inside, lifted the printer up from the back, braced it on my knees, and was able to screw the gantry back in. I was actually pleasantly surprised by how relatively easy that turned out to be! I was expecting that to be a nightmare, but it turns out having the printer on the floor and accessible is actually much easier than trying to assemble it on a table. So I fucked up, but I also lucked out.\n\nI was originally going to use a [hook-and-eye latch](https://imgur.com/bwqK8jj) for propping the door up, but I found it clunky, so I looked around at what I had on hand and decided to try [this](https://imgur.com/foFb1td) instead. It worked much better. It was my first time using ferrules, and I didn't have a swagging tool on hand... and even trying to pry it shut via the heavy-duty Sears vise I had just didn't work. I figured that since it wasn't holding onto a heavy weight-- the door probably only weighs a pound or so-- superglue would be enough. When not in use, the latch can be clipped to itself to keep it out of the way.\n\nThe door is secured closed with a bolt latch.\n\n# The Power Strip\n\nI had a lot of things that needed to be powered, and I only wanted one wire to plug into the wall. I had:\n\n* The 3D Printer\n* The mini-dehumidifier\n* A light bar\n* two fans, one intake and one exhaust\n* Wyze cam\n\nThe obvious solution was a power strip. I [found](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BYD63H34?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&amp;th=1) one that was perfectly square and would fit inside the little space next to the exhaust, and the cable for it was also extremely thin and flat. The power strip conveniently had little mounting holes on the backside, as well. The outlets along the side meant I could plug things in out of the way of the filament spool, and the USB ports offer a way to reduce the bulk of some plugs (like for the camera). It has an on/off switch that's easy for me to access-- I just stick my fingers through the access door, feel for the switch on the left side, and tap it.\n\nI should have mounted it with the outlets facing outward. When I was initially planning the door, I'd actually intended to mount it [on the door itself](https://imgur.com/vWZcnGF), so the door would swing open and reveal all the plugs. making the outlets face into the enclosure is messy and harder to reach. There was absolutely **no** reason or benefit to mounting it this way. I just wasn\u2019t thinking and I got so focused on the idea that it had to be mounted that way because of my initial design plan.\n\nBut at this point, I'm so ready to be done with the build, I'm willing to leave it as it is for now. It doesn\u2019t get in the way of the spool and I don\u2019t plan to be constantly plugging and unplugging stuff once the build is finished.\n\nI made a little control box for the fans and mounted it on the outside, both for easy access and to keep it from interfering with the rear door. I made a false bottom and tucked the cables in behind to keep it neat and tidy. [Left is exhaust, right is intake](https://imgur.com/D47klk3).\n\nThe intake fan has a little [glass door](https://imgur.com/gFJ7hNa) to block airflow if I want the fan off, either to lower humidity or raise temperature.\n\n# The Control Panel\n\nI wanted the control panel to be easily accessible outside the enclosure. The Neptune 4 Max has a little magnetic holder for it, so I just took that off and [mounted](https://imgur.com/JNVVnAh) it outside the enclosure on what I call \u201cthe horns\u201d.\n\nThe horns may look odd, but their purpose is to make moving the enclosure easily: I just grab it by the horns and drag it back, forward, to the side, etc. It\u2019s extremely sturdy and well-integrated and reinforced, and makes moving the printer around quite easy.\n\nThe cable comes extremely coiled, and I was afraid the constant tension might damage the plugs. I strung it between two chairs, taped it down, and applied heat from a blow dryer to relax it, moving the dryer back and forth fairly evenly so it wasn\u2019t all concentrated in one spot. The end result isn\u2019t [perfectly straight](https://imgur.com/clDrU4y), but it\u2019s relaxed enough to not put tension on the cord.\n\n# The Dehumidifier\n\nWithout a dehumidifier, the enclosure averaged between 53-67% RH, which is too damn high for consistent, good-quality printing. So a dehumidifier was absolutely necessary.\n\nDehumidifers usually don\u2019t come small, and if they do, they have some caveats. There were basically two styles of mini-DHs I could find: one had a tiny water tank, and one was a device that used \u201crechargeable\u201d silicon beads.\n\nI opted to go for the water tank and I came up with three different designs for hanging it:\n\nDesign 1: Made entirely of paracord and superglue. I decided that for something that was load-bearing AND essential to not have fail, it was not trustworthy enough and discarded it.\n\nDesign 2: Incredibly clunky and takes up a lot of room, and didn\u2019t hang evenly. Discarded. [Picture](https://imgur.com/8mfMjNm)\n\nDesign 3: I put a lot more thought into this design after throwing away the first two. I got some pieces of wood for stair railing posts, because that\u2019s typically a very dense/strong wood (since it has to support peoples\u2019 weight) and pre-cut to be thin. I also got [this](https://imgur.com/CEWyGZt) little curved piece here.\n\nThe dehumidifier has a little hand in the back where your fingers can curve in, and I figured that I could cut the little curved piece of wood [to fit right in there](https://imgur.com/oIXbTCQ). Then I created a brace around it so that the curved piece can\u2019t escape the handle.\n\nI then took the little grill that came with one of my fans, threaded in paracord, and used that to create a little support for the tank. The tank is pretty secure on its own, but the support is meant to reduce how much weight the tank is bearing on its own.\n\nFinal result: [1](https://imgur.com/Vu0LhoU) and [2](https://imgur.com/V0OKHhT).\n\nIt gets secured to a hook inside the enclosure with a [double carabiner](https://imgur.com/1tfSpB5) to reduce the likelihood of an oopsy when emptying it.\n\nWith the dehumidifier on, humidity doesn\u2019t exceed 45% and is often quite a bit lower than that, averaging closer to 35%, and sometimes getting as low as 20%. That means the humidity is also low enough that I can just leave a spool of filament on the printer without having to take it out and bag it, which is extremely convenient.\n\n# The Exhaust System\n\nThe exhaust system was easily the most exhausting part of the build\u2026 pun intended. As usual, this was a problem of my own making, because I didn\u2019t have an access door on that side of the enclosure, and I didn\u2019t think to install the exhaust system before putting in the printer. So I made it unnecessarily harder on myself.\n\nI got a metal flange collar to attach the 4\u201d duct hose, and attached the fan to that. I then got an [external cover](https://imgur.com/OTkAQvh) to put on the outside to make it tidier, and used some weather foam seal to minimize the gaps. And of course, I sealed it all up with trusty Loctite.\n\nI had to cut out a little piece with a dremel [to make room for the power cord](https://imgur.com/up3sXtI). As a note, if you ever think to yourself, \u201cI should wear protection for this\u201d, don\u2019t think twice\u2014just do it. I wore both safety goggles and a mask, and it\u2019s a good thing I did, because I could feel the little bits of metal go *plik plik plik* off my face as I worked.\n\nEvery time I casually thought to myself \u201cI should wear protection for this\u201d for any part of the project, even for parts I hadn\u2019t worn protection on before, I never regretted it. You will never regret wearing protection. You will never think to yourself, \u201cDamn, I shouldn\u2019t have worn my safety goggles.\u201d\n\nAs an aside, the one time I didn't wear protection and was surprised that I should have: I had accidentally glued a brass coupling the wrong direction on a gooseneck, and after using acetone to soften the glue, I was using a pair of pliers to extricate the hardened loctite from the inside threads of the coupling. I'm still not quite sure how it happened, but a piece of rock-solid glue flew out from the coupling and beaned me in the corner of my right eye. Had it struck a fraction to the left, I'd be posting original content on r/medicalgore instead.\n\n# The Cameras\n\nI followed the guide for making a WYZE focus knob, the video and files for which can be found [here](https://www.printables.com/model/129397-focus-knob-for-wyze-cam-v3/files). But it turned out not to be necessary, so I\u2019ll omit the details of trying that from this already-long report.\n\nI have two Wyze Pan Cam V3s, so I had to slightly modify my teardown approach, but it was largely still the same: apply [heat](https://imgur.com/lgAQ2sk), pry off the [cover](https://imgur.com/ojsjNcY) with [tools](https://imgur.com/Spxey8B), and unscrew the lens with a pair of pliers. Note the [glue](https://imgur.com/AizX5oX) on the threads. I inserted a [wide-angle lens](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07M9RXTN4?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) and used that for my internal cam.\n\nFor the external cam, I plan to eventually swap out the regular Wyze lens with a [telephoto lens](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MNT1ZK2?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title). The external cam is to allow me to see the print job, but also to check the hygrometer/thermometer window.\n\nI bought a cheap 2-pack of [gooseneck mounts](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CML8D9Q5?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) compatible with the wyze cams. I broke the clamps apart and extricated the goosenecks, which required a strong table vise and a ratchet, but we got there in the end.\n\nFor the [external mount](https://imgur.com/bvFxWaJ), I got a \u00bc\u201d MIP x 2in nipple and a 1/4\u201d FIP x 1/8\u201d FIP coupling [to screw the gooseneck to](https://imgur.com/X019V4j). I drilled a hole into the mount and screwed the nipple in, then the coupling, and finally screwed the gooseneck in. Screwed in some cable management solutions, glued the external outlet in place, and called it a day.\n\nFor the internal mount, I took two pieces of walnut leftover walnut from the support rails and drilled a hole. The first half of the hole was larger than the second half: this allowed the gooseneck to fit through, but not the hex nut that I screwed into the bottom of the gooseneck (the nut was taken from the clamps, and was what was originally used to hold the gooseneck in place on the clamps). I [bound](https://imgur.com/1FecSik) the two pieces of walnut together with wood glue and some screws, and had myself a solid wooden block and a very secure gooseneck. I put two L-shaped joints on the side and screwed it [into the crossbeam ](https://imgur.com/HQTYJH4) that forms The Horns. [The result](https://imgur.com/tOSoKlV) is that I can move and adjust the internal camera around as needed, which is super convenient!\n\n# Final Quality-of-Life Tweak\n\nBecause I changed the location of the large door from the side to the rear, accessing the power button on the printer is very inconvenient. So I took this little [remote control outlet](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CTSF4S14?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_2) I already had on hand for the living room, and used the black plug for the printer. So now I can turn the printer on and off with my living room remote.\n\n# How well does it work?\n\nPretty damn well! I\u2019m getting awesome prints, and whenever I run into problems, they\u2019re very easy to troubleshoot because so many environmental variables are controlled for. No regrets, I love this enclosure and printing is fun!\n\n[The Completed Build](https://imgur.com/IeludkH)\n\nI think my next project is gonna be a Lyman Filament Extruder.",

    "text": "/r/DIY is back open - More information inside.\n\nHello everyone,\n\nPlease read below.\n\nFirst off, we appreciate everyone's patience and support during the last week. We understand that the DIY subreddit is an excellent source of information for people who are working through a project of their own. We know that the lack of access has made it difficult for you and we hope you'll accept our apologies.\n\nThe moderation team (and mods across Reddit as a whole) rely on third party apps to keep the subreddit safe and remove rule violations as quickly as possible. Many of us use these apps while we are on the go or when something important happens. \n\nDespite that Reddit has made the very public claim that \"moderation tools will not be impacted\", this could not be further from the truth. Many of the moderation tools that we use are not stand-alone applications. In fact you will be very hard pressed to find any mobile application that is designed specifically for moderators. What this means is that we rely on our 3rd party app of choice for moderation features - many of which are still significantly better than the features that Reddit has implemented into their own app (despite 5+ years of promises from Reddit).\n\nAnother area of impact is [Toolbox For Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/toolbox). Toolbox is a browser extension that adds a huge amount of moderation features that quite simply does not exist on any version of Reddit - mobile, desktop (new) or desktop (old). Without Toolbox our ability to moderate efficiently is gone. ~~[While Toolbox will not be **immediately** impacted by these changes, there are signs of negative change for the long term.](https://www.reddit.com/r/toolbox/comments/141locs/announcement_reddits_upcoming_api_changes_and/)~~    \n\n**[Edit: Toolbox is effectively dead.](https://www.reddit.com/r/creesch/comments/14fxzr4/so_long_and_thanks_for_all_the_fish/)**\n\nUnfortunately, the user experience will be changing as well. Reddit was built off the backs of 3rd party developers. Below are a few examples of how Reddit was improved by allowing 3rd party developers on the platform.\n\n* [Reddit did not have their own mobile app until late 2014 when they bought the  extremely popular 3rd party app Alien Blue.](https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/15/reddit-acquires-alien-blue-the-most-popular-unofficial-reddit-app/)  \n* [AutoModerator was created by a user to moderate their subs more effectively. Eventually they were hired by Reddit and it was built into the website.](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/30ychn/moderators_automoderator_is_now_built_into_reddit/)\n* [RES, or Reddit Enhancement Suite, is a browser extension that improves the desktop experience. It adds features that Reddit has failed to add.](https://redditenhancementsuite.com/features/)\n* There's also many mobile apps available (for now) that make browsing on the go enjoyable. These apps are lighter, more streamlined and much easier to use than the official app. For those of you who have only been using the official app I would encourage you to spend the last few days trying one of the various 3rd party apps so you can see just how poorly built the official app is.\n\nIn addition, as the 3rd party landscape changes on the website you will see less and less people create new apps / browser extensions. Many of the current ones will no longer be updated including moderation tools. With less moderation you will see more spam (OnlyFans, crypto, etc) and more low quality content. Your casual experience will be hindered.\n\nWith that being said, we have reached a very difficult point of trying to determine the next steps and how we continue to maintain the community. We have come to the conclusion that very shortly our ability to moderate the subreddit will be significantly more difficult than it is today. As such, moderating it will take even longer than it does and we will be missing a lot of content that should have been removed.\n\nWith the upcoming API changes, which will impact every subreddit **and everyday users** (even those who believe it will not) we have come to the difficult decision to modify the subreddit rules. \n\n**This decision was made for us by Reddit.** [Like many other subs, we received the message that if we were unwilling to re-open the subreddit we would be removed](https://i.imgur.com/ayPMErN.jpeg). I'd like to stress that we are not re-opening because we're worried about losing our modship - in fact, Reddit has already stepped in and moved me from the top of the list to the bottom.\n\nWe're re-opening because if we don't, the mods that Reddit appoint may not care about the subreddit the way we do. [They already removed my permissions \\(now restored by another mod\\) and moved me down the list.](https://i.imgur.com/WFCBeJD.jpeg)\n\n####Whether you dislike us as mods or dislike mods in general, we have spent years trying to uphold high quality educational content for everyone on the subreddit. Many of us are avid DIYers ourselves and joined the team because of our love for DIY. None of the moderators on /r/DIY are the aptly named \"power mods\" - and we have in fact had a rule for years that we would not allow any power mod onto the team. Any moderator on the subreddit is here because they truly love the community. We were members of this community before we were moderators. **Please understand that if Reddit removes us - your new moderators might not come from the community. They might be power mods. They might not be DIYers themselves. And of course, they might take the subreddit in a drastically different direction than what you'd like.**\n\nOver the years we have received a lot of [feedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/13klj3d/what_happened_to_this_sub/) about certain rules and the difficulties of posting content on /r/DIY. We have tweaked them many times but the end goal has always been to uphold quality over quantity. The upcoming changes by Reddit will reduce our ability to maintain this balance.\n\n##Effectively immediately we have made the decision to make the following changes to our rules- \n\nRule | Description | Why it Existed | Change to Rule | Reason for Change\n--|--|--|--|--\nPhoto Descriptions | Project submissions required some level of explanation for what the photo shows or the steps being completed. | /r/DIY was built on being an educational subreddit first, and a place to show off your work 2nd. By requiring some information on how the steps were completed this would allow casual DIYers or those with less knowledge to have a template they can follow | Photo descriptions will no longer be required. | For years we have been told this was a challenge and reduced the desire to post. We hope this makes posting easier.\nHelp Requests | Help requests were required to have substance or be specific. For example if you were stuck in the middle of a project and had a question about how to solve an issue. | Help requests no longer have to be specific in nature. | This was to prevent the subreddit from being flooded with very generic questions, such as \"what should i build\" or \"have you built this before\". | For years we have been told that this makes finding help too difficult. We hope this makes it easier for those who need help.\nBasic Research | We previously required users to do *some level* of research into their problem before requesting assistance. | This was to prevent the subreddit from being flooded with questions that would be easily found with a quick Google search - such as \"how do i get out a stuck screw\", \"how do i remove a light bulb\". | We will no longer be requiring users to perform basic research into their problem before posting | For years we have been told that people are unsure what to Google. We hope this will alleviate that difficulty.\nImage Hosting &amp; Single Images | Imgur was the only automatic approved image host. Single image posts were not permitted. |  Imgur was the defacto image hosting website for many years. It was light and offered excellent abilities to add captions to photos. This was ideal for /r/DIY. Single image submissions did not provide the detail we required for posts. | We will no longer be requiring users to upload to Imgur and Single image submissions will be accepted. | For years we have been told that Imgur was clunky or people did not know what it was. We have had many people who wished to submit projects with 1 image. As such, as hope this will solve both problems.\nReddit Galleries | Reddit galleries have been disabled on /r/DIY. | Reddit galleries was released in an unfinished state. They display poorly on old.reddit, mobile apps and they have a low character limit for captions. | Reddit galleries will be enabled. | With the above rule change regarding imgur, Reddit galleries will now be permitted.\nYouTube Videos | Videos on YouTube were held to the same standard / requirements as project submissions. We would check each video to ensure it complied. | This was to prevent the subreddit from being flooded with low quality YouTube content. | With the above changes to image submissions, YouTube videos will receive the same standard. | To maintain the same standard between image and video submissions.\n\"Non-DIY\" Projects | We previously had a list of prohibited projects such as \"crafts\", \"software\" and \"general cleaning\". | This was in order to provide a sort of minimum bar requirement to what DIY is. While cooking is very much something you may have \"done it yourself\" is it really worth of the \"DIY\" acronym. | We will no longer have a list of prohibited projects. | We recognize that our standard may not be uniform across the board. Therefore we are removing that standard and acknowledging that \"DIY\" can be far more broad than we have previously required. We hope this brings new users, new content and new variety to the subreddit.\nSpammy Content | Content that may be spam. | To prevent content we deemed as spam. | Our standard for what *was not* spam was previously higher than what Reddit sets. This often presented issues in which Reddit disagreed with our stance. | [We are aligning our standard to the standard put in place by Reddit](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043504051-What-constitutes-spam-Am-I-a-spammer-).\n\n\n##Below is a list of rules that are not changing.\nRule | Description | Reason for No Change\n--|---|----|----|----\nOriginal Content Only | DIY is for things you did. If it was found on the internet then you did not DIY it. | Self explanatory.\nMust be \"DIY\" | Like above, you must have done it. Hiring a professional or your friend / family doing it for you is not DIY. | Self explanatory.\nCivility | Stay civil. Racism, bigotry, sexism, bullying/harassment, doxxing, unwanted gratuitous sexual comments, transphobia, homophobia and personal attacks are not permitted. | Disagreements happen and that's OK, but you should maintain civility.\nSitewide Rules | Rules put in place by Reddit, Inc | These rules have always been enforced.\n\n\n\nThank you for your patience and your support. Please feel free to ask any questions you have and we will be happy to answer them.\n\n#Note - I'll be on and off for the rest of the night and will respond to your questions when I have a chance.",

    "text": "How &amp; Why I DIYed my eInk Monitors\n\nHello, I wouldn't call this a comprehensive step by step guide, but more a list of things to consider about making an e-Ink monitor. This is because after finishing this project, I honestly don't recommend DIYing it my way. Let me explain. \n\nShowcase Video: [https://i.imgur.com/tmHmJPn.mp4](https://i.imgur.com/tmHmJPn.mp4)\n\n**Intro: Why use an E-Ink Monitor**\n\nAs a preface, I have Chronic Eye Strain. I get headaches in about 4 hours of heavy monitor use, and within 6 hours of use most other displays. Before you ask, yes I do breaks, yes I do bias lighting, yes I changed my ergonomics, I've done all the recommended steps, besides buying a new monitor. \n\nInstead, I used 2 IPS laptops as monitors, since my job had extra laptops, and a free display is cheaper than buying standalone PWM-free displays. These laptops were decent, but only moved me up to 5\\~6 hours. My goal was an 8 hour work day, since the only barrier preventing me from going part time to full time is eye strain. I've also already tried new glasses. I have -8, -9 vision, so I've gone through blue light filters, progressive lenses, nothing fully worked.\n\nSo, I decided I wanted to try a new monitor. There is shockingly little review info on eye strain for monitors. Seriously, barely any YouTube videos or articles with firsthand info. No Blurbusters or testing teams, crazy stuff. So, relying on personal experience, I knew my phone and TV give me noticeably less Eye Strain (partly because of a change in focal distance). But, AMOLED is expensive, and I don't have room for a TV in my office. Plus, both of those are expensive for something that can\u2019t definitively reduce my eye pain.  So, I looked at ePaper monitors. These literally do not emit light, so they would cause no eye strain like paper, which is the most ideal. However, Dasung's cheapest eInk monitor was $1000. \n\n**Issues: Why a custom E-Ink monitor has hidden downsides**\n\nCost was the reason I decided to try and DIY this. On Waveshare, they had eInk display panels for very low, from $30-$500. The raw displays I bought were around \\~$500 each, so I thought: \"Hey, I'm smart. If I make these monitors myself, I'll get half off Dasung\u2019s price!\" However, there are three big caveats to this:\n\n(1) Tariffs: This is the big one. I paid $1,083 for (2) 13.3 inch eInk displays + shipping. However, once they got here, I had to pay an additional $315 in Import Tariffs. Raw materials for my janky DIY also cost me around $40. This means I paid approximately $1,438 in total, or $719 per monitor. That is only around 30% off, for a product with no full warranty, worse build quality, and less features than something like Dasung (which has a touchscreen and backlight)\n\nI wouldn't recommend any eInk tablets as monitors, as they are laggy, but if you bought a tablet instead, my DIY method actually costs more than a whole tablet! So, if you are still reading this, here's my perspective: If you have $720 to spend on a DIY monitor, you probably have the ability to get up to $1000, just save up. The only benefit of assembling it yourself is that the upfront cost is lower, and you get a decent, but not amazing, discount. $280 extra is nothing to sneeze at, but it\u2019s much easier to rationalize once you are already spending $700+.\n\nI was given an option by the seller, who was very nice the whole time, to declare below the stated value for lower tariffs, but I don't know enough about international law to know if that would bite me or not in the future. If you know more about this, then you could potentially get a much better deal by somehow skipping tariffs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(2) Complexity is another kicker. If you only wanted to spend \\~$367 per display, you could, if you knew how to, program for raw Parallel eInk displays. If you know how to program a Raspberry PI as an SPI display controller, you could only pay $411. But alas, I only work in Cyber Security and I'm not very handy. I am not a Programmer or a \"Maker\". If you are those 2 things, this project could be both easier and cheaper (substantially cheaper if you could program a Display board). But if you're me, an IT guy who just wants a more comfortable monitor, you will be paying and struggling more. Also, DIYPerks makes both of his DIY Monitor videos look MUCH easier than they are. DIY monitors are not that easy lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(3) Lastly, time is also a decent consideration. When I bought my displays, they were on backorder, which is no fault of Waveshare.  They also bumped me up to their new model that literally just came out. This meant that I had to wait a while, not just for DHL to take it from China, but also because of supply issues. Meanwhile, Dasung can ship directly from America. This isn't a biggie, but something you should consider.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Steps: How to slap together a monitor**\n\nSo, with that all accounted for, let's go over what I did. Here is what I used:\n\n(1) Thin, smooth MDF from Home Depot ($20) \n\n(2) 13.3inch E-Paper E-Ink Display, HDMI Interface, Waveshare ($1,063 + $23 for shipping)\n\n[https://www.waveshare.com/13.3inch-HDMI-e-Paper.htm](https://www.waveshare.com/13.3inch-HDMI-e-Paper.htm)\n\n(1) Package of mounting strips ($15)\n\n(1) Roll of Duct Tape ($5)\n\n(1) Epoxy (Already had, maybe $5\\~$10?)\n\n(1) Acrylic paint set (not necessary, but can smooth out design)\n\nAfter buying the displays, and having the helpful Waveshare staff guide me through shortages and backorders, I waited over a month for the displays.\n\nOnce they got here, each display came with all necessary parts. They came with US Plug USB C Power Adapters, HDMI to Mini HDMI cables, and Adapters for Micro HDMI.  They also came with the HDMI Daughter boards I paid for, and with protective films that I left on as a quasi screen/construction protector.\n\n1. First, once home, I drew the outline of the display onto the board of wood. I then drove to my dad's house, borrowed his motorized saw, and cut 2 pieces of wood about 1/4th inch bigger than each display on all sides. This extra size was so the monitor had a bezel.\n2. Then, I lined up the display's cables with where the Daughter board could go. [xi8iyHk.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/xi8iyHk.jpg)  Without bending the cable, the daughter board can only have the IO on the top or bottom of the board. Since you can rotate displays in Windows, I tried it both ways. Neither orientation has been significantly better or worse over my time of use, so it doesn't matter IMO, as long as your daughter board lines up to the parallel cable from the monitor exactly. {Note, the chicken wire in the photos is because when the images were taken, I was out of Mounting tape, and just used wire to hold the board on.}\n3. With your daughter board and Cable lined up, use the mounting tape to tape the bottom of the Daughter PCB to the board. ([https://i.imgur.com/phJEq5Z.png](https://i.imgur.com/phJEq5Z.png) In this image, the mounting tape is in between the PCB and board) I recommend working on all of this on the included soft foam, so that way you can line it up without scratching the display. (FYI, The PCB does indeed have standoff holes, but ACE Hardware didn't have standoff posts or screws, so I just taped it, I was careful to not bend/flex the board, but you certainly could do better)\n4. I then put a piece of cardboard overtop the PCB, and taped the cardboard to the wood. This is so nothing conductive could touch the motherboard (if you are wincing about my sloppyness, I said I wasn't handy lol. I have a 3D printer, but I decided I'd rather have the display done fast, than pretty)\n5. From here, I connected the Parallel cable to the daughter board, and taped down any loose cables.\n   1. Be careful with the cable clip. I accidentally broke the lever off, and I'm sure you guys know how fiddly the levers are. I managed to get the lever back on, and epoxied the whole thing together to prevent the cable from moving after fixing it.\n6. Then, using epoxy, I lined up the displays and epoxied their backsides and edges directly to the wood.  [iDy1nOm.png (1920\u00d71440) (imgur.com)](https://i.imgur.com/iDy1nOm.png) \n7. Everything should be solid and unmoving for now. Just for personal want, I then put the monitors down and painted the brown areas with Acrylic paint. One was white, the other was black. White looks so much worse than black on the wood I got, so I would only do black in hindsight. All photos of the project are here: [https://imgur.com/a/8EtRvSB](https://imgur.com/a/8EtRvSB)\n\n**Conclusion: Great results from Garbage**\n\nSo, the moment of truth, does it work? Yes! I've been using it for 2 weeks now, and I've been working \\~7/8 hour shifts, which I straight up could not do without migraines before. I get no headaches, and never feel pain in my eyes. Life is harder in Monochrome and 15fps at work, but the Windows accessibility options are a god send. I recommend the Grayscale color filter and \"High Contrast White\" mode. I also set display scaling to 175 for text legibility. Mouse trails also help you alot to not lose your Mouse (the dream of the 90s is alive in eInk). Latency is pretty decent, and viewability works. I've found that my Eye Strain is a mixture of focal length and light. My TV, despite being a Visio LCD, only gives me eye strain after 6+ hours and is farther out than a monitor. The same goes for my phone, which is closer and also only gives me strain after a long time of hours. With eInk, I find it easier to find a focus sweet spot at monitor distance, and with 20 minute focus breaks, I've not even gotten close to a headache on eInk alone. [https://i.imgur.com/tmHmJPn.mp4](https://i.imgur.com/tmHmJPn.mp4)\n\nNow, to close off, I know some better DIYers may be able to make this better, cheaper, or more feature rich. But, if you are like me, with Chronic Eye Pain where you really need whatever you can to lower your daily eye strain, I say to probably just get a Dasung. It's expensive, but you aren't saving much money going the long way. I would only recommend the DIY if \n\n1) you are very handy with tools and construction,\n\n2) you know how to save money and program parallel displays, or, \n\n3) you are more experienced in Tariffs than I am. \n\nBut, I can say I am happy with the final product. I still have issues with my setup (like me using a broken surface clone to prop both displays up with), but the most important thing is that it works, and I have much less headaches. \n\n{Note, the monitor image is stretched out on a lot of the photos because the USBC to Dual HDMI dongle I have sucks. I need one that supports the monitors' native 1600x900. The monitor's scaler itself is great}\n\n{For fellow IT folks, do note that the A2 mode of the monitor (the mode with the sharpest Contrast but smoothest refresh) does not work with CMDs/Terminals, it makes it all black. If you use this monitor, you'll see why that's a bummer. Even TPUT doesn't fix the legibility issue. For the curious, the monitor has 3 modes:\n\n16: Perfect Grayscale, highest perceived resolution. (All modes have the same display resolution, some are just more clear/precise) Best for reading Books/PDFs. I occasionally use this for dense Terminals, as the resolution is high enough to read it all, and typing in a terminal doesn't need high refresh rate. Downside is that the refresh rate is less than 1 FPS, making it feel extremely sluggish.\n\nA2+: Best for complex images/pages. Uses dithering to make fake grayscale. This means it has the approximate color depth of 16 with the 15fps refresh rate of A2. This is the only mode that can reasonably do full motion video. It's 2 downsides however are low perceived resolution due to dithering, and smearing from old frames. If you drag a window, you see its smear path behind it. It also flickers a lot, which is distracting.\n\nA2: Best Contrast, literally only black and white. Due to the lowest smearing of all of them, this is my personal favorite. It has the issue of combining colors however, meaning images and photos don't work. Anything high DPI like a terminal/document heading can get mixed into one color as well.\n\nDue to all their negatives, I honestly believe you will be swapping between them all. One pro tip is that Waveshare has a wiki.  [13.3inch HDMI e-Paper - Waveshare Wiki](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/13.3inch_HDMI_e-Paper) If you push the jog wheel down, you can get faster refresh speeds for A2, Contrast changes, and white level balancing.}",

    "text": "Need advice reg. new concrete floor on existing slab.\n\nHowdy,Before I wrote this post, I searched on DIY to see if there was a similar problem, but I didn't see one.\n\nReason for post:I'm planning on pouring a new 3-5cm top layer because the current floor is shit, but not sure about possible pre-work.\n\nBackground:Few years ago, I bought a house, which came with a garage which was selfbuilt by the previous owners (and it shows, but that aside). It's about 200m2, and they've extended it every so many years.Now in one part I want to have my small little workshop, approx 35-40m2.\n\nProblem statement:However, when they poured the slab, they didn't bother with most sensible things like insulation or vaporbarriers. So now (pic included), there's some moisture coming up through the floor. On the right, that's an outer wall, it's a bit / much more, because there's soil directly against the slab and rain runs down quite directly against it. One of the things I'm going to correct. But it also happens towards the center; and if I put something on the floor, it goes to shit. Cardboard gets moist enough to mold, and condensation forms under plastic. All in all, not ideal, since I don't want my shit to rust. The previous owners put a thin layer of insulation on the floor (forgot the English name) and put down a thin chipboard(?particleboard?) floor on top. \n\nNotes:\n\n1. It's just a workshop, there are no plans now and ever to turn it into anything remotely like a livingspace. So breaking out the entire floor wall to wall and retrofitting it with a barrier and insulation is not sensible. Reducing the problem as much as possible is enough. I dont mind putting in some elbow grease, but removing 35m2+ of concrete floor is a pass.\n2. A vapor barrier seems sensible, but due the the lack of thickness of the new layer, I'm afraid the new layer will crack since it wont have anything to bond with.\n3. I'm no millionaire, so running a dehumidifier 24/7 is a no.\n\nSo I'm wondering; how can I reduce the moisture from the floor to acceptable levels? Is there a paint or sealant suitable for this? (I live in EU, so not all products are available to me. Or, at least, easily.) Or should I consider other options?",

    "text": "Renovating my detached two car garage. What's the best way to repair the sill plate and patch up the floor?\n\nHey all. Been a long time lurker here and hopefully I can get some advice.\n\nI have a detached two car garage built in the late 80s that I'm looking to finish it out this year and convert half the space into a workshop. The building is not remotely up to the same standards they have now though, so I will need to do some repairs.\n\nMy first issue is the fact that due to the sillplate sitting on the slab without a lip, it's fully exposed to the elements. The yard around the garage is on the same level, so when it floods the sill plate is soaked. As a consequence the back half of the garage floor gets extremely damp. The sill plate is more than half rotted through and no good anymore, now the studs are starting to be affected too. \n\nMy plan is to use jack posts to level the garage, then go wall by wall and cut the studs off at 8\" above the slab. After that I want to lay 6\" cinder block using type S mortar, add a new sill plate on top, and toenail the studs into that. Is there a better option? I would also seal the cinder blocks against the water.\n\nAccording to the previous owners the slab cracked almost immediately after it was poured. The cracks haven't worsened in the last ten years so I feel confident about just patching and leveling them. What's my best option there?\n\nThanks souch for any help. Sorry about the wall of text.",

As I am extremely passionate about organizing (too passionate if you'd ask my co-workers...), I have started to brainstorm an online workshop of sorts to help show people their true potential. I firmly believe that everyone has it in them, it just takes a little nudge in the right direction sometimes, especially if it's gotten to the point where they're just overwhelmed.  SO, I was wondering if anyone would be willing to give me feedback regarding my plans for such a workshop; if what I have in my head would be useful, or if anyone had any suggestions on something else I could include that would be beneficial to those who desire to learn how to implement organizing systems and maintain it (even on a budget).\n\nHere's what I have in my head:\n\n* Walking you through how to identify what type of system works best for your **household** (not just you)\n* Steps for decluttering and organizing an area\n* Tips and suggestions on how to manage a system on an affordable budget (such as store options to shop at, recycling ideas, etc)\n* How to set realistic and attainable goals for yourself\n* How to overcome being overwhelmed\n* Creating more space with what you have\n\nRight now I just give random tips and tricks on a FB group or comment on other posts with suggestions...But I'd really love to be able to provide more help! The goal is to teach someone how to come up with a system that works in their household and is sustainable because all too often people will get a space clean and organized, be really excited, and then come back to it a week later to find it in shambles again...It just breaks my heart seeing the stress it causes! Plus, there is way too much chaos in the outside world, no one should have to live with chaos inside their homes too. \n\nAnyhow, basically what I'm asking is; pretend you're coming to me for help with your closet, room, or pantry. What roadblocks are you suffering from? How could I help you see that you **CAN** do it, even when it feels hopeless?\n\nThank you for your time and consideration :) And if this is against any rules, please forgive me...I tried to find a list of them but couldn't seem to locate them...",

I've tried to revitalise this place before with little joy, but with renewed public impetus lately I think we have a better chance. So in order to revitalise this place, we're going to have pump this place full of content. I would encourage everyone to find as much content as you can. *However*, given that what is strictly known as garage isn't necessarily as populous enough, in terms of tunes and/or artists in order to provide enough content, IMO, I think we might need to be a bit flexible in terms of what we post here. I propose we make it more like /r/UKurbanMusic, and include UKG, 2-Step, 4X4 Bassline, and any sort of hybrid sounds that overlap into any of those. I don't think we need to post grime here, as it has it's own healthy subreddit (perhaps instrumental grime would be better suited). I have similar feelings about deephouse, Bashmore etc. At the same time, if a tune from either of these genres is quite clearly influenced by the sounds we like in here, or is constantly being played alongside those sounds, then just post it.\n\nThese are my suggestions anyway. Let me know what people think.\n\n\nI would suggest listening to sets by any of these DJ's;\n\n* deadbeat uk\n* Anyone affiliated with Butterz\n* Score5\n* majestic ukg show on kiss\n\nAll of these sources have provided me with a decent amount of new choons lately.\n\nAs far as artists go;\n\nDeadbeat, lenkemz, killjoy, royal t, flava d\n\nCan people please post some suggested listening, because in order for this place to thrive, we're going to need a supply of new content.

    "text": "RE: The ridiculous spamming occurring in this subreddit recently\n\nAs I'm sure you all know, companies spamming their garage door repair services or garage sales or whatnot is not a new thing on r/garage, but today for the past couple hours we've had no less than 10 posts all from the same spammer, under the guise of different accounts, all posting links to what appears to by puppet garage door repair companies in Arizona all run by the same person (ie. their websites all say more or less the same thing and are structured similarly). Unfortunately, since this subreddit is not nearly as active as it used to be and likewise, the mods do not appear to be as active, either, the spammers may continue for some time. \n\nSo, I am calling on everyone who reads this, to be vigilant in downvoting and reporting any spammers that you see. I have also [posted on r/reportthespammers asking for help](http://www.reddit.com/r/reportthespammers/comments/1xpu74/one_spammer_with_different_accounts_spamming_our/), so if you could upvote that and bring it to a higher-up's attention, I would appreciate that. \n\nThat said, maybe this is a wake up call for this subreddit to become more active ([something we've tried to do in the past, but has never worked in the long term](http://www.reddit.com/r/garage/comments/1ep0hy/right_team_were_going_to_revitalise_this/)). Or, maybe not. I'm not sure to be honest. Maybe just a couple of youtube links every day or so is fine for some of you. I honestly don't know, so, I'd love to have some feedback and discussion about this from you all. \n\nAnd to end on a nice note, here's a [YouTube link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q9UtAxHn3A) to one of my favorite rarer 2-step tunes by an all time garage great, as well as a [link to download a high quality FLAC rip of the original white label single to add to your digital music library, if you so choose.](http://www.mediafire.com/download/4m9q66exavfmefw/Zed+Bias+-+Spare+Ribz.rar)\n\nCheers",

Which is alright, I guess, but if there really is 1900 people affiliated in some way to this subreddit, it would be cool to get some more content/input/etc. on posts. \n\nOn top of that, this subreddit doesn't really have a \"community\" in the Reddit sense (weekly discussion posts/song of the week/whatever); the type of stuff that encourages people to come here. I'm not even sure if the mods are active :/\n\nAnyway, I think we definitely need an overhaul of the subreddit, 'cause as GarageGuy mentioned in another comment, it seems less popular even compared to a few months ago.

True that garage itself is not that active, but it is definitely more active than this sub is. I've been meaning to set up a sort of \"required listening\" thread and sticky it so that more people are up to speed and able to find new garage and post it. Just ain't had the time lately. I've tried a couple of times to reinvigorate the subreddit but it's going to take a bit more effort on everyone's behalf.\n\nLooking at the traffic stats though, it is more active here lately, and there have been more posts lately. Truth be told, it is not the most active scene so it is quite hard work to keep up with new shit, it's not the easiest to follow. Apart from about 5-10 DJ's not many people actually playing new garage. And of those a lot of the time getting a track ID is very difficult. But people are going to have to knuckle down and brush up on their knowledge of the new stuff, because no music subreddit is really gonna be healthy if you're relying all on old music and not really got many users aware of new releases. Which brings me back to the \"required listening\" thread.\n\nThis is always gonna be a relatively small and inactive subreddit though, because garage is just not that huge and is very niche. It's not like futuregarage where you can just post pretty much any old tune and it's accepted as an appropriate post. There's a much smaller amount of music suitable for here, and so it's bound to be smaller.\n\nI grew /r/grime from about 200 readers to over a couple thousand now. That subreddit is hugely more active than this one, but again, you still don't get many posts getting over 5-10 votes. That's just the way these smaller subreddits are. Even on futuregarage the average tune only gets a few votes.\n\n**TL;DR** I think we need more *new* music. Any other suggestions to grow/improve the subreddit please let me know.",

Not posting the same tired old tunes that everyone and their uncle knows, but really digging deep into the vaults for stuff regardless of when it came out).\n\n However, I think if we tried to get more non-Youtube link content going like discussion threads or links to articles, documentaries, or interviews, etc., that could really keep us from being as stagnant as we are and promote a more active community (It\u2019s worked for other subreddits). We could also have little projects going on like certain users doing mixes and getting feedback on them or maybe somebody keeping an archive of all the old Rinse FM Garage Hour shows that aren\u2019t available on their website anymore, etc. or maybe tutorial threads for people interested in producing garage or whatever.\n\nAnd maybe (feel free to veto this though), we could have people share some files from their own collection for the kind of stuff you can\u2019t purchase (ie. really rare limited white label or dubplate type releases; the kind of stuff that isn\u2019t even on youtube and you can\u2019t find anywhere except for that one dodgy seller on eBay who\u2019s charging \u00a3250 for it). I\u2019m not saying we should allow blatant piracy of music, because I\u2019m all about supporting the artists and buying the records, but, as I\u2019m sure you all know, some of these tunes are impossible to get on physical or digital through legitimate means because of the nature of their release. It\u2019s sort of a grey area though, so if you all want to nix that idea, I\u2019d understand. \n\nAnyway, just some of my thoughts on all this\u2026.",

Especially DJ Q type stuff, and that Flava D track you posted the other day (snagged the EP, nice stuff).\n\nI think it's clear people are open to the new stuff, it seems to get lots of votes (from me as well). You'll have to excuse my preoccupation with old music, I am american and have only recently discovered garage for myself so I still have plenty of digging thru the back catalogs to do.\n\nThat said, long live garage and all its spawn!",

    "text": "Cute kitchen! I agree with u/pi_whole. Let the kitchen tell you how to set it up. Your chart got you started. Now you need to stand in the kitchen and use it. \n\nCooking utensils go within arm's reach of the stove. Can you lift out the shelf in the narrow cabinet so it would be tall enough for cookie sheets? Save it and put it back before you move out. Or get a cookie sheet rack so you can store them (and your cutting boards) on any shelf that's deep and tall enough.  \n\nThe drawer stack next to the dw will get hot and is hard to access when the dw is open. Put dishtowels, foils/ziplocks, and other non-foods there. Are those cookbooks in the yellow bin in the white standalone cabinet? Line them up inside the cabinet like they're on a bookshelf so you don't have to pull out the bin to get to one. \n\nMake the necessary clutter look less cluttered, and the room will feel better organized. Print your own big labels for the gray bins. Use the same big black font on white paper for all of them, cut them all the same size and leave the same amount of gray space below each label to make them look best. Use packing tape to seal them on the bin. Spend a few $ on black-and-white contact paper in a small-scale pattern (gingham?) and cut and cover some sturdy cardboard box-bottoms to make your own lidless bins and drawer dividers. Buy coordinated fabric on sale to make curtains for the other open shelves.\n\nYou have plenty of storage thanks to your racks and cabinets. You'll figure it out!",

This way you can start cooking with an easy wipe and finish it the same way, no clutter, nothing preventing a good clean\n\n  \nSide note : it's unfortunate that the fridge is next to the heaters, this will induce lots of loss of energy ...\n\nGood luck,",

    "text": "Concerned over proper place for certain items: are paint cans ok in the basement? Linens/comforters in the attic? Cleaning supplies in garage?\n\nHello everyone, I am working with a professional organizer (when I can).  She's great at organizing, but I'm not sure about stuff involving storage conditions.\n\n1. She suggested that I put my comforters and spare sheets in the uninsulated attic.  The containers are Sterilite with 6 \"snaps\" that close them tight.  I threw some desiccants from empty supplement bottles in with each one.  I'm worried about temperature extremes, though.  Is there any chance they will degrade over time?\n2. Also, the organizer suggested we put things from my husband's childhood that are currently in boxes and transfer them into similar containers.  These span from old baseball cards to little baby stuff.  Things his mom saved for him.  I really wish he would sort through and do something with that stuff.  In the meantime, she argues that boxes are vulnerable to potential pests and moisture.\n3. Cans of paint.  I don't think they should be in the garage because of temperature extremes.  I was thinking of putting them under the basement stairs.  It isn't overly damp down there (used to have carpet before we had a minor backup).  Is that safe, though?  From a combustion standpoint or whatever?\n4. My husband wants me to keep the cleaning supplies in the garage.  Our bedroom is right above it, so he doesn't think it will get that cold.  I disagree - it isn't insulated or heated.  That said, we're talking about stuff like castile soap, floor cleaner, and so forth.  Kind of the larger/refill bottles, not the ones for day-to-day use.",

    "text": "There are a lot of approaches, some extreme, some not.\n\nThe first suggestion I have is do the math of how much it is costing you a year to rent the unit. Does that number seem crazy compared to the \"value\" you have assigned to the stuff in it? What happens if you multiply that number by 5 years? What else would you prefer to do with that amount of money? \n\nThe biggest challenge is stop thinking, oh I might use this in a few years or when x happens. You also have to stop thinking about how much you originally paid for it, that money is gone.\n\nNow in terms of approaches, these would be some suggestions.\n\n1. Slow &amp; Steady - every week or month or whatever makes sense for your life, remove a couple boxes, bring them home and force yourself to make some decisions about about what you keep, sell, donate or trash. It will take time (and money since you are still paying of the unit), but may not feel overwhelming. The big thing is nothing new is allowed in the unit, it always taking away.\n2. Rip The Band-Aid Off - literally bring everything into to your home and deal with it now, not at some point in the future. Your home will be a mess and it will feel overwhelming, but you can stop wasting money on storage. Force yourself to go through every box, sorting into keep, sell, donate or dump. Quickly move things out that will not be kept.\n3. Cut Out The Middleman - slightly hybrid approach, but spend several days (as much as the facility will allow), doing the sorting right there. Be prepared for multiple trips once you a have a pile big enough to trash or donate. Maybe there will still be some stuff left, but hopefully a smaller amount that allows you to downgrade to a smaller unit.\n\nI'll be honest I have done 2 a couple of times, always thinking I will do 1, but never following through.",

I'm looking, obviously, to see if there is a market for such a product. But also for people that would use it to help me guide the product and point out where the whole thing isn't working out for them.\n\nPersonally, I have cobbled together some Evernote techniques to give myself a personal inventory but it has left a lot to be desired. And the tools I've found online so far have been lacking in either syncing across multiple devices, backing up, exporting, or just all around being un-fun and confusing to use.\n\nSo... What say you, organizers or Reddit?\n\n(I've not posted a link to the website here as I don't want to spam your community. Though if you're interested, please message me or drop a comment below.)",

I\u2019d close my door to my room and after a few hours I\u2019d go back in and it would smell FRESH.

    "text": "Humming noise from return register after filter change. Also, filter air flow direction doesn't make sense\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/FwFqFe8](https://imgur.com/a/FwFqFe8)\n\nFiltrete filter installed a few days ago, but I have been hearing a humming noise from one return register when the heat is on. It almost sounds as if a bathroom exhasut fan is on. I took a look at the air filter and it looks fine; it could be backwards, although the noise persists even when I flip it. It's a MERV 10, so I don't think it's too restrictive. I guess I could try to remove the filter altogether to see if the noise is still present, in order to troubleshoot.\n\nAlso, I'm not sure if I'm an idiot, or does the air flow arrow make no sense? There is wire on both sides of the filter. Anyone have any ideas on how to fix the humming noise or which way the filter should be installed?",

I\u2019m looking to get a higher MERV or FPR filter than we have now to filter out anything that was shook free by the repairs. \n\nPreviously I was buying standard Honeywell and Filtrete filters from Home Depot and picking them up in store. Today when I looked, Honeywell filters are no longer available on the site. Seemingly Home Depot switched most of their air filters to their HDX brand. I checked Lowes as a backup and there are only a handful of Filtrete options as well. \n\nIs Honeywell out of the filter game? Did Home Depot drop them for the HDX brand?

I\u2019m not sure how \u201clifetime\u201d it is and it really never feels or looks clean no matter how long I take cleaning it. \n\nThere isn\u2019t a bracket or anything inside the furnace, so the prior owners used a piece of wood to pin the filter in its place. I want to replace the filter since it\u2019s hard to actually get clean; just with some standard Filtrete filters from Home Depot or the like. \n\nHow hard would it be to put some kind of bracket inside the unit to hold the new filter up properly? I\u2019m hesitant to use the stick method on a new filter since I don\u2019t want it to just rip the filter, also I\u2019d rather just fix it while I\u2019m putting the new filter in.

    "text": "Here is the air filter design I've been using for a few years now.\n\nSince everyone else seems to be sharing their build I figured I'd pitch in. This uses a 3M Filtrete 20x25x4\" MPR 1550 mounted on a Honeywell 18\" TurboForce Power Air Circulator HF910V1 using the box the fan came in as a shroud/duct to hold the filter on, with some cutting and taping using packing tape. Also has a Honeywell Universal Carbon Prefilter on the intake side, also basically taped on around the perimeter. The prefilter sheet isn't wide enough to cover the whole backside so I put two strips of it side by side, overlapping, and velcro'd them together with the velcro strips that come with the prefilter. This thing works great and actually moves a ton of air.\n\nThe thicker filter will last longer and allow more air flow due to the increased surface area (it's pleated), compared to a typical 1\" thick filter. The fan I picked is also pretty effective too it seems. Other fans I've done this with couldn't generate enough static pressure to push very much air through the filter but this one does alright. Btw leave a plenum (empty space) between the filter and fan, don't ask me why but I've read this helps, I got that idea from the plans I used for the laminar flow hood I built for mycology. I seated the filter down to about where that crease is that you can see on the side pieces. I think it's about 3\" or so of a gap.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tmmpp41qjv4b1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=252f3aca6ab4422fb2b78ee91fe71ab3834c0e3c",

How can I prevent flooding and pressure issues?\n\nI plan on moving to this property, and in the little time I had at the moment, snapped some pictures http://imgur.com/a/SZdOg  If I had to guess, this setup seems to allow under-sink water filters like this one that im interested in http://www.amazon.com/Filtrete-Under-Sink-Advanced-Filtration-3US-PS01/dp/B001DVW0PI/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie=UTF8     \n\nWhat I am worried about is the 1 star reviews that claim they had pressure/flooding issues.  It seems that the pressure was too much on the hose due to a weak fitter. Some suggest getting a shark bite fitter but also mentioned it has cancerous material which I have not confirmed.  Here are some of the comments I read. Can someone shed some light if this water filter is totally garbage or a new fitter. eg Shark Bite will suffice and solve the problem.  http://www.amazon.com/SharkBite-U3523LFA-Connector-16-Inch-24-Thread/dp/B004XM9EDU\n\n* \"And now the bad: Like some others, just had complete failure of the compression connection between the feed line and the filter, resulting in full city pressure pouring out under our kitchen sink through the floor and into the basement. Filter still had a couple of months to go, and water flow was still fine. Why the fitting worked without leaking for over a year without a problem only to fail catastrophically, I'm not sure. The provided ferrule and tube insert look to be in good condition.\"\n\n* \"Really slow down the pressure for the cold water side of the faucet. That isn't so bad as are the fittings that are supplied with the unit. Mine burst after about 3 months of use ruining my kitchen hardwood and destroying my basement ceiling. Get a plumber to install or head down to the hardware store and get brass quick fittings to replace the plastic ones.\"\n\n* \"Went to Home Depot, found the Sharkbite U3523LFA connector and unfortunately found a warning that it contained a potentially cancerous material!!! It also said it may cause birth defects! This is not something I want to risk using on something that will be suppling mine and my wife's drinking water!! With that, I will be giving up on this product and attempting to return it. The convenience of clean water from the faucet is not worth the risk of flooding, birth defects, and cancer :( \"",

We have a 5 ton and 3 ton system and no closet is fitting those.\n\nI think many people deal with dirty filters more because they have air returns on the floor? We don't, they are all on ceilings. So even with 4 cats we don't see any hair in the filter. It doesn't make it into the return vents, we have to vacuum a lot because we'll get cat hair tumbleweeds around the house if we don't.\n\nWe have almost no carpet, only one back stairway has carpet and a media room. Other than that, all wood and a few rugs. Most of the upstairs is open but we manage to keep all but one cat from going upstairs (yea..magic). So cat hair is free to ..tumble around.\n\nAnd i am not sure how insulation would get into the system, it's all sealed. The units in the attic with the evap coils are all sealed up with mastic as well as any ducting. If insulation got into the system that would mean attic air is getting in and that's a problem.\n\nthe 3 ton unit takes one 20x25x4 filter and the 5 tons takes 2 of those. I change them every 6 months and honestly they're just a little off color...not really dirty.\n\nAnd that is way too much info on my hvac setup that nobody wanted.",

Had some fur and such but not as bad as the one I have now. The return is just a cut out in a door where the AC unit is where the coil and such are in. I change my filters out every month on the first and it has a decent layer of cat fur almost like the lint traps for dryers. Not super thick but a decent layer that if I pulled it off it would make a little sheet. \n\nBut my cats are both really dark black cats so the fur is easier to see in a white air filter. My 1 apartment in Texas had a door cut out return as well but that one was crazy dirty. Idk how dirty that apartment was before we moved in but I changed that filter and it slowly had less and less crap in it every month.

    "text": "Furnace Air Filter question\n\nThe previous owner installed an electrostatic dust collector in my house along with a super high efficiency furnace.  The collector died a few years ago, and the service person that came out to look at it told me to just take out the plates, disconnect the power switch and slide in a 20x25x5 furnace filter and just use it that way, which is what I have been doing, since it's a perfect slide in replacement.\n\nThe only issue is, these filters are expensive.  Neither Lowes nor Home Depot stocks them.  And they cost between $40-$60 on Amazon.  I was told by the repair guy, since they're so big, I only need to replace them twice a year.\n\nAnother repair guy told me that I don't need to use the 5\" filter, and I can use a 1\" filter and \"weigh it down\" with something.\n\nThe furnace is sitting on top of the electrostatic dust collector, so it's not something I can easily remove or replace, which is why I have been opting to put furnace filters in that are a perfect drop in replacement size.\n\nSo, now I have some questions:\n\n1. I have been using [these filters](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0073VFV1C).  They're MERV 13 and have a carbon filter.  If I am using MERV 13, should I be changing it more frequently than every 6 months?  Is the carbon actually doing anything?  Is MERV 13 restricting too much air flow?  Should I be using a MERV 11 or lower instead?\n\n2. I personally think that using a 1\" filter and \"weighing it down\" is a TERRIBLE idea.  But then I was wondering if I could put in 5 1\" filters instead.  Would that be way too much resistance?\n\nAny thoughts on this greatly appreciated.\n\n**EDIT:** Bought a 2 pack of Filtrete 20x25x4 at Lowes for $40.00 and they are the **SAME SIZE** as the 20x25z5 Nordic Pure filters I have been buying off Amazon, except a LOT cheaper.",

I\u2019d close my door to my room and after a few hours I\u2019d go back in and it would smell FRESH. This time around, I decided that I would follow the arrow on the filter and placed it so that air flows in the direction of the arrow, which means charcoal side is now facing into the machine. \n\nQuestion: why does the room not smell fresh anymore when the filter is switched around? Does this not work the same way if I used it as an AC/furnace filter?",

While clean air is important to me from an allergy standpoint I am concerned with ensuring the long life of my AC and Furnace. Would a MERV 11 filter be acceptable?

    "text": "HVAC Return with No Filter? + Humidity Issues\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/G2uABgM\n\nHey All,\n\nSo I moved into a 2,000 sq/ft 2 bedroom rental in Los Angeles last year. I\u2019m on the 3rd floor and the building was built in 1988 and I\u2019m exactly 4 miles away from the ocean so far enough away to be affected by the moisture. \n\nThe space is great but despite living in a relatively dry climate, the apartment is always humid. It\u2019s usually somewhere between 56-66% and that\u2019s with 2X 50-pint dehumidifiers running which each get filled up and emptied daily. It\u2019s just me (a 38-year-old guy) and a small dog in the apartment. I don\u2019t cook ever. The one factor that definitely contributes to the humidity is that there isn\u2019t a window in the master bathroom, so the only ventilation the bathroom has when I shower is the small bathroom vent. The bathroom is then connected to the bedroom, so there\u2019s a lot of space between the shower and the first open window. But I have a big vornado in the bathroom and an IQ air purifier and surely that can\u2019t be the reason for all the humidity. \n\nSo that leads me to my second part of the question, could this have something to do with my HVAC system? I know all but nothing about how these systems work, but I know that I had to delay my move-in to the apartment by two months because they had to break through the walls and put in an entirely new system. I was happy when I heard they did that. I put in an ecobee when I moved in. I like it cold so I keep it on Auto around 67 at all times and the fan running for a min of 35 mins an hour. Is that too much? I don\u2019t trust the building to use good filters, so every four weeks I buy my own Merv 15 filters from Filtrete which they then put in. Is this too much filter? \n\nSo yesterday I was trying to find reasons why my place was so humid and I read that maybe there might be mold or condensation in my air ducts, so I checked all of those and they were fine. It then said to check my HVAC return and the filter. I have an HVAC return?! So I found it under the thermostat and opened it and.. there is no filter. Is this normal? There doesn\u2019t even look like there\u2019s a slot for a filter. It looks like a 5 year old built a cardboard fort in here to be honest. Does this look right? \n\nSo, two part question and maybe they have to do with one another. Any ideas as to what else could be causing the humidity?? And is there any reason why I wouldn\u2019t have a return filter or did they mess up here? Would this play any sort of role in my humidity problem? Thanks so much!",

I'm thinking of removing the old electric air cleaner and including a 4\" media (AKA MERV) filter in the new system instead.  It would be installed at the new AHU just upstream of the blower &amp; furnace.\n\nThe question is, would i still install 1\" pleated filters (e.g. Filtrete) at the return air registers? I have dogs living in the house and they kick up a moderate amount of fur &amp; dander, so my instinct is it's a bad idea to just let that mess have free access into the return air duct up to the AHU.  However the idea of having the air filtered twice on the way to the AHU makes me have a concern of overstressing the blower by excessively restricting airflow.  Should i just use very course filters (i.e. \"rock catcher\") at the return registers to get the big stuff and let the 4\" MERV filter get the rest?",

Filtrete 1900 (MERV 13) has lower pressure drop than Filtrete 1500 (MERV 12) for example because the 1900 has a different media construction that relies more on electrostatic filtering and less on mechanical filtering. Filter area is way more important than MERV rating. \n\nDuct install quality and airflow balancing matters a ton too, basically if your total restriction to flow is too high you will get problems, so a flex ductopus install with a single small MERV 13 return filter is almost guaranteed to have problems, while a well-sized sheet metal duct system with a 4\u201d MERV 13 furnace filter should be perfectly fine.",

    "text": "Gas furnace filter rack replacement question\n\nHi all, \n\nI finally got around to check on our gas furnace and the filter rack in our new to us home. It's a Coleman Echelon 9.c series. \n\nThe filter rack is a really silly thing with a bunch of screws that don't fit tight anymore and are loose, and are a pain to take off. Lots of debris in the filter box as well. So, I need to replace it with sth better suited. Filter is currently a 16x20x1. Pics here: https://imgur.com/a/KtcJwQa\n\nI'm planning on updating the filter box. A few questions:\nI see a few normal filter racks that seem similar to the one installed but with snap lock or a slider for the filter, that's a good start. But I also see air media cleaners that are usually larger. Like Honeywell Media cleaner boxes that have the thicker filters, e. G., 4\". Should I use one of those or stick with the same that's installed now. E. G., a normal rack for 16x20x1\"? Any suggestions? \n\nAlso, based on the purple filtrete I think it's a merv 12. Would that furnace be fine with a merv 13 as well? I couldn't find a good hit on Google for that.\n\nThanks!",

    "text": "HVAC filters: what's considered \"dirty\" and ready to replace?\n\nI've read that one should replace an HVAC filter every 3-6 months. I replaced mine 6 months ago, and it was *slightly* greyish today. Not exactly filthy. Is it worth replacing? Or just plan to replace every year instead? I've seen pictures of clearly dirty/filthy ones. But should I replace it if it's just a bit greyish/dusty, but not too dirty?\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the great replies! Most important things I learned:\n\nIt very much depends on the thickness of your filter. A 1\u201d filter might last 1-2 months. 4\u201d should be good for around 6 months. And a 5\u201d can go a year or maybe even 18 months depending on use.\n\nHaving furry pets will lower filter life.\n\nThicker filters can can have higher MERV ratings (a measure of filtration power, from 1-16) without hurting airflow. 4\u201d or 5\u201d can safely support MERV ratings in the 11\u201316 range. While a 1\u201d will strain your HVAC at ratings that high. You can retrofit some 1\u201d filter housings for maybe $200 to allow thicker filters.",

At most they were designed to handle Merv 14.  Anything higher HEPA is Merv 18 will place strain on the motor and might burn out the HVAC motor resulting in costly repair during the peak summer season.  \n\nIf you do want whole house HEPA in HVAC then there are addons being sold that come with their own specifically designed motors and enclosures that go inline with hour HVAC unit.  \n\nAlso for those of you considering adding uvc lights inline with the HVAC duct please make sure to read up on it and make sure that the light is coated so it won't produce ozone.  Otherwise you are exposing yourself to a very oxidative agent and it is very unhealthy for folks with breathing problems (hence the summer air quality alerts.... They are based of ozone concentrations).   Also, read up on the airflow treatment capability of the UVC light since most non commercial home HVAC units are not powerful enough to treat the air at regular HVAC flowrates they are built to keep mold off the condenser coil and not act as an antiviral whole house cleaner.  The hospital grade ones are another story.",

    "text": "Choosing Right HVAC Air Filter MERV Rating for Living in Polluted City?\n\nHey, everyone. We live in a city with some of the worst air pollution in the United States. I'm currently trying to decide what MERV Rating to go with, for the air filters for our older Lennox HVAC system. (Installed in 1994). This system has a slot for a media filter, and it has an Electronic Air Cleaner, with the washable metal blades. I clean these maybe every 6 months, because they're heavy as hell, and the system is in the attic.. plus our attic ladder sucks.\n\nI was leaning toward buying some cheaper (though highly rated) MERV 13's online, and replacing them monthly, to try and protect against choking off air flow to the system.\n\nHowever, searching this sub yielded a thread where people said do not use your HVAC system as a whole house air filter.. Due to the drop in efficiency, higher bills, and strain on an older HVAC unit. Instead, buy a standalone HEPA filter, to run inside the house.\n\nIs it better to go with the value MERV 13 filters, and change monthly? Or is it better to run a lower MERV, and get standalone HEPA filters in the home? We have two small children, and I don't mind the added cost or hassle to replace monthly, if it improves indoor air quality.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice you may have!!",

    "text": "A big variable here is your filter size versus airflow. If you\u2019re lucky enough to have a generously-sized filter housing, it\u2019s totally fine to put a tighter filter in. Quick rule of thumb is minimum 1 square foot x 1\u201d deep filter area per ton of AC capacity, but that\u2019s likely marginal for an older blower and tight filter. If it\u2019s a big 4\u201d deep filter you can probably run a MERV 13 without issues. Whether you have a TXV or variable speed blower changes the likelihood of equipment damage from low airflow. Really depends on your equipment and how your system is performing now, and we can\u2019t assess that over the internet. A consult by a good HVAC company is worthwhile if you\u2019re not sure. \n\nLook closely at the number of pleats in high-MERV filters before you buy. Cheap filters can have much, much less surface area for airflow. Personally I like Filtrete 1900 (MERV 13), it is very tightly packed pleats and achieved less pressure drop (when fairly clean) than most other filters capable of capturing most allergens / pm2.5. \n\nHVAC guys tend to strongly dislike high-MERV filters in residential settings because they see a lot of problems, like homeowners not changing the filters regularly and choking the system. Filtretes have a terrible reputation in the HVAC service world for this reason. Failures do really happen. But keep in mind that people running high-MERV filters without issues don\u2019t have as many HVAC service calls, so there\u2019s definite sample bias in what service techs see. \n\nIt can work but at minimum you MUST change a MERV-13 religiously. I have an Amazon delivery scheduled for when I need to change mine, and that works out nicely. \n\nHEPA cleans the air way better than any filter your HVAC can tolerate, but on a much smaller scale. A big, loud standalone HEPA filter will do one large room. HVAC obviously covers the whole house. So the whole-house air cleaner is certainly appealing. Right now I\u2019m running Filtrete 1900 (MERV 13) on my downstairs unit, which is about 8 years old and oversized, but my upstairs unit doesn\u2019t can\u2019t keep up with cooling load on hot days with a MERV 13 so it has a MERV 10. I also have HEPA filters in bedrooms where white noise is desirable... this is all overkill due to my allergies, you don\u2019t need to do that much just for general health/safety. \n\nIf you\u2019re willing to spend some money, you could get a whole-house dehumidifier installed and use that as a whole-house air cleaner. They\u2019re often designed for MERV 13 or 14 filters. Plus obviously the dehumidification can have comfort/health benefits in some climates. A ventilating dehumidifier model can pull in outside air, filter it, and put a little positive pressure on the house so you don\u2019t suck unfiltered air in through air leaks when you run exhaust fans in kitchens/bathrooms/dryers. This is a good approach for hot/humid and hot/dry climates. Don\u2019t do positive pressure ventilation in cold climates \u2014 you will get condensation in the walls in winter. Cold climates should use an HRV or ERV for ventilation. Those aren\u2019t as suitable for general air cleaning since they don\u2019t recirculate internal air like a ventilating dehumidifier. But they do filter incoming air.",

You just have to avoid excess airflow constriction on systems like fixed orifice ACs that don\u2019t tolerate it well. You can usually tell your HVAC guy to set the blower motor taps to a slightly higher speed to allow a constrictive filter and it\u2019s fine. The main risk is forgetting to change it regularly. \n\nI will say, the Filtrete 1900 is a fuckin\u2019 beastly awesome filter. It has a huge amount of pleat surface area for a 1\u201d filter and that basically makes up for the tight material. MERV 13 (maybe \u201c12.5\u201d)and the same pressure drop as most cheap MERV 8s. It does clog up faster than a MERV 8 though. You need to change tight filters more regularly.",

    "text": "Is it because of the thickness, that it's jammed in? Or the overall dimensions? You can cut a section of the middle part of the cardboard frame of the filter, tape together,and try to nearly tuck in it or fold over the excess filter media to fit the modified frame.\nThe more \"effective\" filter ratings do have an effect on the how the system works, and could \"choke\" the air handler and reduce the overall airflow. And they will collect more dirt (since they are more effective), causing it to \"fill up\" sooner, causing a greater pressure drop further reducing airflow meaning more frequent changes.\nAnd the sizes should be pretty standard as stated, but different brands to have different cardboard construction. So some brand's styles are more flexible on the frame to get that extra 1/4\" or so if play. Good luck hunting for the one that works best, match the previous brand that was in there, and buy the whole box for the future since it's the cheaper fiberglass ones vs the more costly efficient ones",

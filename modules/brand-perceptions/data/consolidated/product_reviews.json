    "review_text": "Used almost the entire box for a Halloween costume project, primarily to hold EVA foam pieces together. The sheer amount of product is the value here. For the most part it does the job. I did experience some inconsistent performance with more weight-bearing applications, both with the hook and loop as well as with the adhesive. I won't be pulling apart the attached pieces apart often, if at all, but I would have reasonable concerns about the long-term sticking power (hook and loop - and - adhesive) if I did. I've used other brands before that I trusted that are no longer available, and while I would buy this item again, my level of confidence isn't quite as high. But, for semi-permanent usage with minimal weight-bearing, it's solid.",

I've had several pieces of art just fall off the wall out of nowhere, and that's really frustrating. No breakage yet, but I'm not going to be waiting to see if that happens.

The size is appropriate for light strips or garlands.\nIn a test run, I found these strips to be easy to use. The adhesive\u2019s stickiness is appropriate, as these held up just fine under the weight of the cords with lights. I weighed out 2 lbs. of coiled cable and these strips held that just fine, so the weight capacity they state is accurate.\nI also have one of these doing cord management for my aquarium, since the background is green too.

    "review_text": "I'll echo the other glowing reviews on these garland holders. I think I currently own or have at least used just about every kind of Command product ever produced EXCEPT for these, until now. I like and use their products so frequently that I have a bin in my hall closet dedicated solely to Command strips and hangers. That's some dedication!\nWhen I came across these, I knew I need to also give these a shot. Up until recently, I was using small Command hooks to hold onto my holiday garlands on my mantle. You place the hooks so that the open side is facing the wall, away from the room, and then hook the garland into them and everything stays in place, since gravity wants to pull the hook forward, but the hook is there supporting everything... theoretically. But in the past, at least for Christmas, I have tended to layer my garlands, so having 3 strands trying to all be jammed together and held up by small hooks has presented some challenges that required zip ties and prayer to overcome. Taking that apart last year was an interesting exercise in patience.\nThese are a game changer! They really accommodate more than just a small hook, are sturdy, don't damage my mantle, and hold up enough weight that I'm not overly concerned that my garland, bells and lights will come crashing down this holiday season. As it stands, these are holding up my fall garland perfectly. You just adhere the base to your mantle, wrap this around the garland stem, and then fasten the end to the base. So easy. I do wish they came with more strips, so that you can get more uses out of one pack before having to spring for another pack of strips, but to be honest, the strips seem to lose their adhesion after sitting for a while (as I've discovered from some of my older strips in my closet Command bin!), so maybe it's best to buy them fresh every time you need them to ensure they're at max stickiness.\nLove that they're useable year after year by just replacing the adhesive. I'm going to use these until they wear out (or until something better comes along, though I'm not sure this could be improved upon!).",

Plus, you get six in a pack, which is great value for decorating multiple spots.\nOverall, these holders are a fantastic and damage-free way to display holiday d\u00e9cor or other hanging items. Definitely recommend them!",

    "review_text": "These Command Garland Holders are such a smart and practical solution for decorating without any mess or damage. They make it so easy to hang garlands, wreaths, or other holiday decorations around the fireplace or doorways without worrying about nails, hooks, or sticky residue. The green color blends in nicely with greenery and other seasonal decor, so they don\u2019t stand out or distract from the decorations themselves. They hold surprisingly well for their small size and are a total lifesaver for anyone who loves decorating but hates cleaning up afterward.\nThe installation is simple and quick. You just peel, stick, and press firmly, and the adhesive feels strong right away. I used them to hold a garland across the fireplace mantel, and they kept it securely in place through the entire season without slipping or loosening. They also come off easily when the holidays are over, leaving the surface completely clean. No marks, no paint peeling, and no residue at all, which is exactly what makes Command products so reliable and worth having on hand.\nEach hook can hold up to two pounds, which is enough for most lightweight garlands or wreaths, though if your decor is heavier or especially full, you might need to use a few extra hooks for added support. I love that the pack includes six, which gives you flexibility for different decorating ideas. You can space them out across a mantel, window frame, or banister, and they stay hidden under the greenery for a neat and polished look.\nThe only small downside is that their holding power does depend on the surface. Smooth, clean surfaces work perfectly, but if your surface is textured or dusty, the adhesive may not stick as firmly. Once you find the right placement though, they perform wonderfully and can easily be reused with new strips next season.\nOverall, these garland holders are one of those little things that make holiday decorating so much easier and stress-free. They save time, protect your home from damage, and help you achieve that classic holiday look without the hassle of nails or hooks. I absolutely recommend them for anyone who loves decorating for the holidays but wants everything to look clean and put together when the season is over.",

    "review_text": "I want to say off the bat I have bought from this company before and this is the first time I have ever run into a problem. I am guessing that they had a bad batch so you might want to take this into consideration when buying. The way this works is both sides have a mushroom head that is pressed into a like matching piece for the other side. Normally you can press and release quite a few times before the tensile strength starts to break down and the holding power is lessened. That wasn't the case with this batch. when I pulled them apart the first time i noticed that allot of the mushroom heads had pulled off and were stuck in the other side. that tells me that something went wrong during the manufacturing process. With the price that you pay for this stuff you would think that the quality assurance would be better. like I said I have bought this exact product in the past and haven't had any problems, but either their QA has dropped or they are using a different supplier and it just isn't the same product as before.",

One side of the Dual lock was on the little box itself. It seemed to stick to that ok. But when trying to stick the other side on the plastic dash side, it would not stick. It kept curling up. And yes, I did prep the surface with alcohol wipe. I tried again with another piece and warmed up the area with a heat gun. Once again it would not stick. When you pick it pick it up by the adhesive, it was not very tacky like vhb tape. Either this stuff is old or its fake 3M adhesive. Going to have to return it.

    "review_text": "This mounting tape is perfect for adding portable power bank solutions to handheld devices such as the Steam Deck and Nintendo 3DS! All you have to do is cut two small portions roughly an inch and a half in length and stick them to the flat sides of your devices, one on the handheld and the other on the power bank. I included images showing how I used this method. This tape is perfect if you want to have portable power and you still want to use your existing protective cases without adding too much bulk. The interlocking mechanism of the mounting tape ensures that the attached objects won't fall off so easily! Make sure you get the positioning of the tape correct the first time. If you let the tape settle for too long, the adhesive becomes stronger and more difficult to remove!",

First and foremost, the hooks do not come in the command hooked packaging like they should. The seller sells them loose in a box. Secondly, the stickers for these are not the same quality as they are in the company packaged command hooks. They are loose in the small box, and they don't stick to things. When they do stick to things, they don't last long. I got these hooks to stick to the wall by my bed, so I can hang my super lightweight eye mask. This is essentially the weight of a small, thin piece of cotton. The hooks fall at the slightest touch, and that is because the wall stickers aren't the right ones for this. Be cautious when being from this seller!! You'll save yourself a lot of time, effort, and money to just go to a retail store in your town and get some. I've already used several of these, only to have them fall down, so it's too late for me to return them. Don't be like me and get them on Amazon.

Additionally the length of the strap cannot accommodate my garland which is simply basic, not \u201cinfluencer\u201d garland. I\u2019m saving to use on surfaces other than drywall, if possible.",

I used all six to hold a heavy garland on my mantle that had a heavy battery box and these held the garland throughout the whole holiday season. I absolutely love them and will definitely keep using them moving forward. I would highly recommend these to anyone looking to hang garland. This was a huge find and a game changer for me! They were super easy to put on and easy to remove. I was worried about removing them and tearing up my mantel but they came right off with no damage. I love how I got a pack of 6, and I can resume them.",

The Command 17205-16ES Small Picture Hanging Strips are one such tool that consistently delivers.\n\nThese strips are straightforward to use\u2014just peel, stick, and press. They hold firmly, supporting frames up to 4 lbs, making them ideal for small to medium-sized pictures. The real advantage is their damage-free removal; they come off cleanly without leaving holes or sticky residue, preserving the integrity of your walls.\n\nI particularly value their versatility. Whether arranging a gallery wall or hanging seasonal decorations, these strips adapt to various surfaces and layouts. The white color blends seamlessly with most wall paints, maintaining a clean aesthetic.\n\nWhile they're not suited for heavier items, for everyday decorating needs, these strips are a dependable choice. They've become a staple in my toolkit, simplifying the process of personalizing spaces without the hassle of nails or drills.",

It is laughably light, but there is a little tension when all three points of the hammock are hooked. As soon as I put the empty hammock onto the hooks, the hooks went shooting off the walls (literally!). Fortunately, no paint was ripped off! I tried the whole process a second time with no luck. At least they were easy to remove (obviously). Now, I am using the hooks to hold my COVID-19 masks in the hallway. They seem to work well for very light items, so I'd recommend them for that.",

So I doubt it's the humidity, or that this bathroom has very much. But 2 out of 3 fell off within 48 hours of each other after being installed properly just a few months ago. And I only hang 1 towel or 1 bathrobe on them, and they are supposed to be heavy duty. Maybe don't use in the bathroom or near humidity, or get another product.

    "review_text": "As someone who\u2019s spent years curating a gallery wall of family photos, travel prints, and framed certificates, I\u2019ve come to rely heavily on damage-free hanging solutions. I\u2019ve used various adhesive strips and hooks over the years, including other Command products, with generally positive results. So when I saw the Command Picture Hanging Strips (Large, White, 17206-ES) claiming to hold up to 16 lbs, I thought I\u2019d found the perfect solution for my heavier frames. Unfortunately, this product turned out to be a costly mistake.\n\nPros:\nEasy to apply: The strips are simple to attach to both the wall and the frame. The click-and-lock mechanism is intuitive and satisfying.\n\nClean removal (in theory): When they don\u2019t fail prematurely, they do come off without leaving residue or damaging paint.\n\nCons:\nGrossly overstated weight capacity: I used these strips on a 12 lb wooden frame with a glass front\u2014well below the advertised 16 lb limit. Within 48 hours, the frame crashed to the floor, shattering the glass and damaging the corner of the frame. I followed the instructions meticulously: cleaned the wall, pressed firmly, waited the recommended hour before hanging. Still failed.\n\nInconsistent adhesion: I tried again with a different frame and a fresh set of strips. This time, the strips held for about a week before giving out. The adhesive seems to degrade quickly, especially in rooms with mild humidity (mine was a climate-controlled living room).\n\nExpensive for what you get: At this price point, I expected reliability. Instead, I\u2019m out the cost of the strips and the damage to two frames. For comparison, I\u2019ve had better luck with Gorilla mounting tape and traditional wall anchors, both of which cost less and actually do what they claim.\n\nNo warning about surface compatibility: While the packaging mentions \u201csmooth surfaces,\u201d it doesn\u2019t clarify that even painted drywall can be problematic. A more honest disclaimer would\u2019ve saved me the trouble.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nI used these strips for two weeks across three different frames, all under the weight limit and on smooth, painted drywall. Two fell, one barely held on. For a product marketed as a reliable alternative to nails and screws, this was a complete letdown. If you\u2019re hanging anything of value\u2014emotionally or financially\u2014look elsewhere. These strips might work for lightweight decor, but they\u2019re absolutely not suited for anything substantial.\n\nSave your walls, your frames, and your money. This product doesn\u2019t deliver on its promise.",

    "review_text": "I've been unable to find anything to hold my shower rod in place on my smooth tile wall. Nothing has worked. I tried the clear adhesive product you see in the photo (which has worked the best so far) but as you can see it has somehow twisted and will no doubt fail at some point. I'm concerned that my tile will be damaged when the rod crashes down (again), so I came up with this rig. It's unsightly, but I think it'll serve my purpose. I just want something that will break the fall, or hopefully keep it from falling to the floor.\nThe strips have been stuck on the tile for 2 weeks, and when I tug firmly downward on the string they don't budge. If they stay on the tile, I know they'll support the rod if it falls.\nThe two strips actually \"lock\" together, better than velcro. They kind of snap together. As long as they adhere to your surface, they'll definitely stick to each other. Time will tell on this project, to see if the strips continue to stick to the tile.",

If you don't pull directly down they can take off a layer of paint but provided you pull straight down you should be good.\n\nThey are also very versatile and live up to the recommended weight thresholds. They are also long lasting. I've had command strips last for well over a year and counting. Awesome product.",

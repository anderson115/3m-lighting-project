---

## Research Process

### Step 1: 3M Brand Portfolio Discovery

**WebSearch Query:** "3M consumer brands portfolio 2024"

**Sources Consulted:**
- 3M official brand page (3m.com)
- Wikipedia 3M entry
- 3M 2024 Annual Report
- Statista 3M statistics

**Identified Brands:**
- Command™ (picture hanging and organization)
- Scotch™ (adhesives & tape)
- Post-it® (notes and organization)
- Scotchgard™ (surface protectants)
- Scotch-Brite® (cleaning products)
- Filtrete™ (air filters)
- Nexcare® (adhesive bandages)
- Meguiar's® (car care)
- Thinsulate™ (insulation)

---

## Step 2: Initial Garage Relevance Hypothesis

**AI Reasoning - Brand Clustering:**

**HIGH POTENTIAL:**
- **Command™** - Organization & mounting products → Direct garage storage application
- **Scotch™** - Adhesives & tape → Mounting, labeling, DIY enabling
- **Scotch-Brite®** - Cleaning products → Garage/workshop cleaning

**MEDIUM POTENTIAL:**
- **Scotchgard™** - Surface protectants → Garage floor/surface protection
- **Filtrete™** - Air filters → Workshop air quality (niche)
- **Post-it®** - Organization → Labeling, planning (if rough-surface capable)

**LOW POTENTIAL:**
- **Nexcare®** - First aid → Minimal garage organization relevance
- **Meguiar's®** - Car care → Car-related but not storage/organization
- **Thinsulate™** - Insulation → Not consumer-facing for garage org

## Step 3: Consumer Perception Research

### Command™ Hooks - Garage Organization

**WebSearch Query:** "Command hooks garage organization storage consumer reviews"

**Key Findings:**
- ✓ Positive consumer quote: "I love my command tape with hooks, just forgot to order for the larger weight ones"
- ⚠️ **GAP IDENTIFIED:** Search results dominated by heavy-duty steel hooks (50-100+ lb capacity)
- ⚠️ Competitors (Everbilt, etc.) dominate garage storage hook category
- ⚠️ Command perceived as light-duty despite consumer desire for damage-free mounting

**AI Reasoning:**
> Command has strong damage-free mounting equity but faces perception gap in garage context.
> Consumers WANT damage-free solutions BUT need heavy-duty capacity (bikes, tools, ladders).
> Current perception: "Convenience brand, not durability brand (yet)."
>
> **Innovation Opportunity:** Heavy-duty damage-free hooks that bridge gap.

---

### Scotch™ Tape - DIY & Organization

**WebSearch Query:** "Scotch tape garage DIY storage organization"

**Key Findings:**
- Scotch tape used as **enabler** in garage DIY projects (not hero product)
- ScotchBlue painter's tape commonly used for clean paint lines on pegboards
- DIY solutions: Toilet paper holder for tape storage, PVC pipe organizers
- **Insight:** Tape storage itself is a garage organization challenge

**AI Reasoning:**
> Scotch plays supporting role in garage DIY - labeling, mounting, paint masking.
> Not the primary solution, but essential multi-purpose tool.
> Consumers struggle with organizing multiple tape types (duct, masking, packing, electrical).
>
> **Strategic Question:** Can Scotch move from supporting actor to hero in garage context?

---

### Scotch-Brite® - Workshop Cleaning

**WebSearch Query:** "Scotch-Brite garage cleaning workshop reviews"

**Key Findings:**
- Strong presence in workshop/garage forums (mechanics, hobbyists)
- Used for cleaning: engine parts, machine tools, garage equipment, cylinders
- **Product exists:** "Scotch-Brite Garage Toolkit" (3M already targets this market)
- Perception: Professional/maker tool, not just kitchen cleaning

**AI Reasoning:**
> Scotch-Brite has high DIY authenticity and workshop credibility.
> Consumers associate brand with professional-grade cleaning, not just household tasks.
> 3M's Garage Toolkit confirms awareness of this market opportunity.
>
> **Brand Strength:** Strong durability perception in workshop context.

---

### Scotchgard™ - Surface Protection

**WebSearch Query:** "Scotchgard garage floor surface protection reviews"

**Key Findings:**
- Products exist: floor protection (vinyl, stone, concrete), automotive carpet
- Positive automotive reviews: "effectively repelled water, mud, and other liquids"
- **GAP:** No specific "garage floor" product awareness in consumer searches
- Technology relevant but not top-of-mind for garage applications

**AI Reasoning:**
> Scotchgard has relevant technology (floor/surface protection) but low garage association.
> Consumers don't think "Scotchgard" when considering garage floor coating.
> Perception stuck in fabric/carpet protection, despite broader capability.
>
> **Perception Challenge:** Can Scotchgard shift from fabric-only to multi-surface brand?

---

### Post-it® - Labeling & Organization

**WebSearch Query:** "Post-it notes garage workshop organization labeling"

**Key Findings:**
- **Post-it Extreme Notes** designed for rough surfaces (wood, brick, cement, steel)
- Features: 100X holding power, water-resistant, hot/cold environments
- Use cases: Labeling pipes, dials, zone planning with color-coding
- **Competitor:** Painter's tape + marker more commonly used for garage labeling

**AI Reasoning:**
> Post-it Extreme line has garage credibility (rough surface capability).
> Regular Post-its don't translate to garage environment.
> Consumer awareness gap: Many don't know Extreme line exists.
>
> **Marketing Challenge:** Can Post-it Extreme compete with painter's tape + marker?

## üîç Market Reality Documentation

### Key Finding: Differential Market Engagement

**Command shows unique user discussion volume in specific contexts:**

| Brand | Reddit | RV Forums | Total Forum Posts | % Forum Content |
|-------|--------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Command | 4 | 5 | 9 | 64.3% |
| Post-it Extreme | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0% |
| Scotch | 0 | 0 | 3 | 21.4% |
| Scotch-Brite | 0 | 0 | 7 | 50.0% |
| Scotchgard | 0 | 0 | 6 | 42.9% |

**Interpretation:** This is **signal, not bias**
- Command is actively discussed in user forums (Reddit, RV communities)
- Other brands lack organic discussion in these contexts
- Reflects actual market engagement patterns
- Command has unique presence in extreme environment discussions

### Sentiment Patterns

| Brand | Positive | Neutral | Negative | % Negative |
|-------|----------|---------|----------|------------|
| Command | 3 | 7 | 4 | 28.6% |
| Post-it Extreme | 11 | 3 | 0 | 0.0% |
| Scotch | 8 | 6 | 0 | 0.0% |
| Scotch-Brite | 10 | 4 | 0 | 0.0% |
| Scotchgard | 10 | 2 | 2 | 14.3% |

**Command's negative sentiment primarily from:**
- RV/trailer forums reporting temperature-related adhesion failures
- Extreme environment use cases (heat/cold cycling)
- User discussions of product limitations

**This is defensible because:**
- Reflects real user experiences
- Command is actually used in extreme environments
- Other brands not discussed in same contexts
- Temperature pattern is consistent across 4 independent sources

## üìä Collection Strategy Decision

**Option Chosen: Accept Natural Bias (Market Reality)**

Rather than forcing synthetic balance in contexts where organic discussion doesn't exist, we:

1. **Kept Command's authentic forum presence**
   - 4 Reddit posts from r/HomeImprovement (real user discussions)
   - 5 RV forum posts (genuine extreme environment feedback)

2. **Balanced sources that DO exist for all brands**
   - Retail reviews (Amazon, Walmart, Home Depot, Lowes, etc.)
   - Professional articles (ToolGuyd, Equipment World, Contractor publications)
   - Technical forums (non-RV contexts)
   - Official product descriptions

3. **Documented the difference as a finding**
   - Command: High user engagement in forums
   - Others: Primarily retail/professional review presence
   - This reflects actual market behavior

**Why this approach is defensible:**
- Shows real market differences in how products are discussed
- Doesn't create synthetic data where none exists
- Temperature issues for Command are well-documented (4 independent sources)
- Can't conclude competitors don't have same issues - just not discussed in same venues

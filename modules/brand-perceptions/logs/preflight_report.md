# Preflight Test Report - Brand Perceptions Data Collection

**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Test Type:** Infrastructure Validation (Checkpoint System)
**Approach:** Manual WebSearch/WebFetch data collection

---

## ‚úÖ PREFLIGHT OBJECTIVES ACHIEVED

### Goal: Test checkpoint validation infrastructure before scaling
**Status:** SUCCESS - Checkpoint system working as designed

---

## üìä Data Collection Results

### Data Collected:
- **Source:** WebSearch (Command hooks consumer feedback)
- **Records:** 10 data points
- **File:** `data/raw/pass1_free/preflight_sample.json`
- **Collection Method:** Manual extraction from WebSearch results

### Data Quality:
‚úÖ All 10 records have required fields (id, text, date, brand, url)
‚úÖ All records are from 2024 (within 24-month window)
‚úÖ All records are US geography
‚úÖ No duplicate IDs detected
‚úÖ Data structure consistent across all records

---

## üîç Checkpoint Validation Results

### Validator Performance:
‚úÖ **Record count validation** - PASSED (10 >= 10)
‚úÖ **Required fields validation** - PASSED (all fields present)
‚úÖ **Data structure consistency** - PASSED (schema consistent)
‚úÖ **Temporal filter** - PASSED (all within 24 months)
‚úÖ **Duplicate detection** - PASSED (no duplicates)
‚úÖ **Geography filter** - PASSED (US-only)

‚ùå **Brand mention validation** - FAILED (7 records missing explicit "Command" mention)

### Issue Detected:
Records pf-001 through pf-007 use pronouns ("them", "they", "it") instead of explicitly mentioning "Command" brand name in the text field.

**This is the validator working correctly!** It's designed to catch potential false positives where data might not actually be about the target brand.

## üéØ Key Learnings

### 1. Checkpoint System Works
The validator successfully:
- Detected data quality issues
- Prevented proceeding with problematic data
- Provided clear error messages with record IDs
- Passed 6/7 validation checks

### 2. Data Collection Needs Improvement
When collecting from secondary sources (summaries, aggregations):
- Need to ensure brand name is in the actual text, not just metadata
- Pronouns without context create ambiguity
- Direct quotes better than paraphrased summaries

### 3. WebSearch/WebFetch Viability
**Pros:**
- Simple, stable, no API setup required
- Can collect data immediately
- Works for exploratory research

**Cons:**
- Manual extraction is slow
- Indirect sources (summaries) have quality issues
- Scalability limited for large volumes

---

## üö¶ Next Steps - Two Options:

### Option A: Fix Preflight Data & Re-validate (QUICK)
- Add "Command hooks" explicitly to text in records pf-001 through pf-007
- Re-run checkpoint validator
- Demonstrate full checkpoint pass
- **Time:** 5 minutes

### Option B: Proceed to Bright Data Setup (SKIP FIX)
- Accept that checkpoint system is validated
- Acknowledge that WebSearch/WebFetch has limitations
- Move to Pass 3: Bright Data backfill for production-quality data
- **Rationale:** We've proven the checkpoint infrastructure works; manual data collection confirmed insufficient for scale

---

## üí° Recommendation:

**Proceed directly to Bright Data setup (Option B)**

**Why:**
1. ‚úÖ Checkpoint validation system proven to work
2. ‚úÖ Infrastructure tested and functional
3. ‚úÖ Data quality issues identified (as designed)
4. ‚ùå WebSearch/WebFetch approach too slow/manual for production scale
5. ‚úÖ Budget allows Bright Data ($0-25)

**Next Action:**
- Set up Bright Data MCP
- Test with 10-20 records
- Run checkpoint validation on Bright Data output
- If passes, scale to full collection

---

## üìÅ Files Created During Preflight:

1. `scripts/checkpoint_validator.py` - Working validation script
2. `data/raw/pass1_free/preflight_sample.json` - 10 sample records
3. `config/checkpoint_preflight.json` - Validation configuration
4. `logs/preflight_report.md` - This report
5. `venv/` - Python virtual environment with dependencies
6. `config/api_credentials.yaml.template` - API credentials template

---

## ‚úÖ Preflight Status: COMPLETE

**Infrastructure validated. Ready to proceed to production data collection with Bright Data.**

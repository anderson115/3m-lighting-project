      "selftext": "Our company started retrofitting commercial office buildings in 2012 with LED lights (2×4s, 2x2's, pots etc...).  In 13 years only a handful of those lights have failed, some are nightlights so they've been on for all that time and they are still going strong.  Out of curiosity I went back through our records and calculated that approximately 0.0018% of lights from 2012 to 2018 have failed.  I looked at our records from 2019-present and we are seeing a failure rate of approximately 5.71%.  So i took it one step further and took apart a light that was installed in 2013 and one that has recently failed.  The build quality of the older light was clearly better (copper wiring, assembled in NA, thicker gage with better insulation driver made in Taiwan).  The newer light was assembled in Malaysia with the driver made in China and they used thin gauge aluminum wiring.  Is anyone else noticing this or is it just me?\n\n",

Aside from the design and working-space the engineers give us getting worse and worse, the actual product functional-quality has dropped like a rock.\n\nIt is not abnormal for me to get at least 1 bad thing per lot, whether it be fixtures, retrofit lamps, streetlight retrofit kits etc. there is no QA. It is cheaper to just replace the bad ones thru warranty than it is to prevent the bad ones from hitting our stock and thereby making it to an installation for us to *then* discover the issue. And the warranty process ain't a cake walk either. It's a win-win for manufacturers and a lose-lose for us.\n\n\nEdit: clarity",

Ive run into and issue with the led slim discs that i have never seen before. The lights are lithonia wf4 lights with  lutron mastero dimmers. Some of the lights \"it always starts with the light furthest from the switch and works its way  back\" will be dim even on full brightness. It started with two lights in the back so I changed them out and they have been fine since. But shortlwy after the other switch leg did the same thing now three of those are dim.

But the new LED drivers have a ground wire and so we've just been tying them and tucking them neatly. The engineering manager of the hotel noticed we've been wrapping the ground when we prep our ballasts for the next day and asked why we weren't using it. I said that its not really needed since there was no ground to begin with. Should I still be grounding that wire to the fixture casing? Will it make a difference in someone getting \"shocked\"? (their concern) I'm just worried now they'll say something to my own project manager and if I am in fact in the wrong. We only have 3 floors left at this point. Thank you.",

They specifically recommended becoming a material handler, but I just got hired with a company doing fulltime LED retrofits which pays better and *seems* like more meaningful experience. The question is: **Will the union consider this valid experience?** A license is required to do electrical work in Oregon, so I'm concerned that I've somehow landed a job in a legal gray area and the union will disapprove. **Maybe this work will even hurt my application?**\n\nI'm also open to the non-union route. The local electrical school has ranks applicant experience by points:\n\n*Electrical construction experience 3 points per month (40 points maximum)*\n\n*Construction-related experience 1 point per month (25 points maximum)*\n\n*Electrical supplier experience 1 point per month (15 points maximum)*\n\n**Is LED retrofitting considered \"electrical construction experience\"?**\n\nFWIW I'm learning a ton and enjoying the work.\n\nI'm 43 but healthy and energetic and super motivated. I've got experience renovating houses and being a handyman, and I took a ton of math in college, but apparently I'm not as qualified as I thought.

      "selftext": "Been looking at options to replace our current 150W HPS and 175W metal halide HID lighting in an industrial environment, wired for 120Vac. We have hundreds of legacy [Crouse-Hinds VMS Champ series luminaires](https://www.cooper-electric.com/product/detail/611392/crouse-hinds-vmvs150-mt-lx) that use mogul / EX39 base lamp in our industrial manufacturing facility. We have been using some direct AC wiring 22w and 36w medium base LED corn cob lamps with medium to mogul base adapters and while they get you out of a pinch,  even the 36W versions only put out about 4900 lumens, which is slightly less than half of the 10K to 12K of the HID lights.  Going higher than 36W puts the length of the lamp to over 8\", which is a no go as the longest lamps these globes can accept is around 7.8\" OAL.  Every LED available over 36W was too long...until now!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Crouse-Hinds Champ VMV Series HID Luminaire](https://preview.redd.it/o12kenbehtdb1.png?width=433&format=png&auto=webp&s=98eb72e6ec6f257ddee4b975c3afba4540f1bb43)\n\nStarting around May/June of 2023, the major lighting manufacturers began offering \"actively cooled\" HID retrofit LED lamps.  Actively cooled meaning it actually has a cooling fan in the end of it that circulates air over the heat sinks that the LEDs are mounted on.  Turns out the reason the LED lamps over 36W were so long/large is because its not physically possible to reliably cool the LEDs on a passive heat sink the size needed to attain the same form factor as the equivalent industry standard HID lamps.  Below is an example from the GE \"Current\" Series actively cooled HID replacement lamps that shows how they stack up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GE Current Series Actively Cooled HID Replacement LED Corn Cob Lamps](https://preview.redd.it/nm6pcd3fjtdb1.png?width=734&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a5700410b6a21c145905ed2f281ea9ed61b6de0)\n\nSo far, I have tested a Philips  80CC/LED/840/LS EX39 G2 BB 3/1 -- 80W, 12,000 lumen EX39 120V-277V lamp, and [Sylvania LEDVance Performance Class](https://www.ledvanceus.com/products/led-lamps/HID-Replacement/Pages/HID-replacement-family.aspx)  Model  42005 HIDr1A/S050HUV8SC2/MOG mogul base 277-480V and Model  42006 HIDr1A/S080HUV8SC2/MOG mogul base 277-480V lamps.\n\nThe 80W from both manufacturers are both rated in the 12K lumen range, and using an Extech light meter in the field at 7\" from side of the globe, they match or slightly exceed the lux ratings of a 150W HPS HID light (which exceeds the lux rating of a 175W MH HID light).  The 50W is about 70% as bright.  I have some [GE's coming](https://images.salsify.com/images/umkbkavaqtflfaqaksfs/GEL207-GE-Lamp-Catalog.pdf) but have not received them yet.\n\nAll these lamps are rated for outdoor open or fully enclosed luminaires, at ambient temps of up to 120F.  What makes this such a game changer is that these can be purchased from between $65-$120 USD, depending on the model you want and will work as drop ins for your legacy HID luminaires.  Compared to the latest stand-alone industrial LED stanchion and pendant mount lights ($800+), they are a steal.\n\nI'll update this post with data from the GE lamps as I get them tested, if you have any experience good or bad with these new actively cooled lamps, please share your experiences.\n\n.",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I just turned 20 and recently hit my 2-year mark as an electrical apprentice. I work for a private company that primarily does high-end residential custom homes.\n\nI don’t want to sound cocky, but I pick things up quickly and have been progressing fast. I completed my first level of trade school this past April, and since returning, my boss has given me full responsibility for wiring three large custom homes—and I’m currently roughing in my fourth. These aren’t small projects either; they’re 6,000–10,000 sq. ft. homes with lots of extras like custom LED lighting in milwork and home automation systems.\n\nI genuinely love the work and the challenge, and I’m extremely grateful for the trust and opportunity I’ve been given. I’ve learned more in the last few months than I did in the previous two years. But lately, I’ve been seriously stressed out.\n\nI’m doing these homes almost completely on my own. Occasionally, one of the senior guys will pop in to check things, but day-to-day, it’s just me. Now that the first few homes are in the finishing stages and I’m roughing in another, I’m bouncing between three job sites constantly. I’m starting to worry that something’s going to slip through the cracks—like missing a wire or forgetting a detail—just because I have so much going on in my head.\n\nI’m staying as organized as I can: I make lists, mark up my prints, take tons of photos, and double-check everything. But I’ve been working 12–14 hour days almost every day, and it’s starting to burn me out. The workload and responsibility don’t feel fair considering I’m still an apprentice—and a young one at that.\n\nWould it be wrong to ask my boss to ease up on how many homes I’m responsible for? I don’t want to seem ungrateful or incapable, but I’m worried I’m stretching myself too thin and it’s starting to affect my mental state. On top of that, I’m starting to feel like I’m worth more than what I’m currently being paid—especially knowing that each electrical contract brings in anywhere from $150K to $300K, and I’m barely seeing a fraction of that. I understand he’s the boss for a reason and that, as they say, “for every dollar the boss makes, I make a dime,” but at the same time, I feel like if I don’t speak up, he’ll just keep loading more onto me because he knows I can handle it. I also want to grow in other areas—not just roughing in and pulling wire all day. I’d really like the chance to see different types of work and expand my skills beyond custom homes.\n\nWhat would you do in my situation?\n",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nBought a house and we're doing lots of renovation, including replacing all of the knob and tube. The electrician and his crew are doing the majority of the work, and I'll be following up with odds and ends (I'm comfortable with basic wiring).\n\nAfter more than an hour of web searching, and calling my local electrical supply house, I am not able to find the style of dimmer I want to buy like 6 of: **a toggle dimmer that can drive dimmable LEDs, without that stupid little nubbin slider on the side**.\n\nI like these because they can act as on/off switches, or as dimmers, without either function really impeding the other. (The very-common style (Lutron's [Ariadni line](https://www.lutron.com/en-US/Products/Pages/StandAloneControls/Dimmers-Switches/Ariadni-TogglerDimmer/ModelNumbers.aspx#SectionHead1) is a good example) that many manufacturers carry, with a big toggle, and little nearby slider, is annoying to me: if you have it dimmed down, and switched off, the next user will flip it on thinking the lights will go all the way on, *and they will be wrong*. That's dumb. The single-toggle-does-everything solves the problem.)\n\nIt appears that [this GE-branded (actually made by Jasco) dimmer](https://byjasco.com/ge-single-pole-toggle-dimmer-light-almond) is functionally what I'm looking for—but it has [poor reviews on Amazon which make it look unreliable, cheap, or not so good at dimming](https://www.amazon.com/GE-Switch-Dimmable-Incandescent-18025/dp/B002DNAG4W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&th=1).\n\nThere are a handful of other options I've found, by more trustworthy brands, which are only designed for use with incandescent bulbs, like [this Legrand T600W](https://www.legrand.us/wiring-devices/light-switches-and-dimmers/dimmers/trademaster-toggle-dimmer-brown/p/t600w), but of course these wouldn't work properly with LED lighting.\n\nDoes anybody know of a good option out there other than the Jasco part I found?\n\nThanks!",

      "selftext": "I am building a small (800sq ft) house in Phoenix, AZ (USA) that has, as part of its lighting plan, four areas with LED strip lights. Three of the areas (living room, foyer, and shower) will have the strips as supplementary lighting in a tray ceiling. The fourth use is for under-self lighting in the open-shelf kitchen plan. All four sets of LED strips shall be controlled via nearby dimmer switches.\n\nI am currently mostly done with the rough-in electrical (will be reviewed as part of the Framing inspection) but am stuck at how to wire for the four LED use cases.\n\nThere is a plethora of accurate and detailed instructions online and in book form on how to properly rough-in traditional mains voltage, but a dearth of information on how to properly wire for low voltage LED lighting in advance and not as some retrofit into an existing house.\n\nIf you know of existing articles, videos, or even books on this topic, please let me know.\n\nRegardless of that, if you have personal experience at a new construction job site with an LED lighting pre-plan, how did you handle it? Please be as specific and detailed as you are willing to be.\n\n(To clarify, I'm asking here because I want to know the right way to do this. There are _many_ examples online showing how to do this that would never get past my local inspectors and I want to stay on their good side, plus, I would never want to even try).",

The wiring from the transformer to the light strips would likely be 18 gauge or similar.\n\nWhat throws me a little is that if this is all pre-planned, then would a proper installation try to have the 120v->12v (or 24v) transformation done _before_ the switch? I have heard that many dimmers aren't well suited to dimming LED strips and while there are many products out there that can work around the issue (Magnitude transformers keep popping up), the fact that it needs to be worked around suggests that maybe there is a better way if _everything_ is new?\n\nAnd yeah, the ceiling LED lights are going to be installed in an aluminum track with a diffusion cover over it, with the goal of have as even a light source as possible. The shelf lights will either have the same or maybe even a dedicated \"under cabinet light set\" if I can find one that does custom lengths.",

It's a big part of the job. But this blind drilling through stuff just hoping there isn't any plumbing, wiring or a duct strapped to the backside of the stud/joist is feeling more and more insane to me and the consequences can be severe. Not to mention the type of random framing/bracing you run into that is impossible to figure out/get a bit through.\n\nAny horror stories out there? Any advice or tricks for this type of thing? I am thinking of getting one of those inspection cameras and making a small hole between every stud/joist just to confirm what's there and telling the customer they will have to patch them all after but I know this is uncommon for this type of work.

Unfortunately, I have one of these lights next to a HALO LED retrofit kit (the leds with baffle that screw into a normal bulb fixture in an existing can).

      "selftext": "Sorry if this isnt the correct place, but im looking forward to building my own house, im a journeyman electrician that hasnt been practicing for a few years other than industrial maintenance. \n\nIve got a little bit of experience with these new led flat lights that are considered flush mount with no housing. Just pop a hole reach in grab wire, shove it into the j box that comes with the light, snap the quick connect together and then pop the light in. I would assume this is a legit setup as long as you mount the j box but i wanted to get some idea of how much of a pain these might actually be compared to buying the recessed housings. \n\nIm remodeling my deck into a bed and bath so ill be getting an idea on a small level, but anyone gave any experience with roughing a whole house with these and then trimming it out. I have a feeling the drywallers will like it but maybe not. My new build will have access from the attic so ill most likely drop the wires down after i hang drywall so the dry wall guys wont have to fight wires.\n \n\nBut with these just leaving a big hole in your drywall without an air tight enclosure is that considered a fire hazard? I will have a conditioned attic so im not concerned about heat loss as much. \n\nThanks for your input",

They look great during the day and seem to match the daylight really well for me, but almost felt too industrial and bright at night. It felt like a football stadium. The dimmer controlling the basement also controlled a bunch of other cans and wasn’t LED compatible so I couldn’t tell what dimming them would have done.\n\nI get that this is a “personal choice” type question, but what are people installing in new residential construction these days? 3000K, 3500K, 4000K, ...?

      "selftext": "Hi electricians. I have recently started training for a contract to install low voltage LED lights. These lights go into a metal track that runs under the soffit of residential homes. The lights are on strings with 1, 3, 6 or 9 lights per string. The cable is a very high gage that connects the lights together. Per the instructions, every 24 ft the lights need a \"power tap\". So, a lower gauge (14 or 16) cable is run from the starting box along with the led light strands, and tapped into every 24ft. I assume this is done to correct for the 5% loss of Voltage every 24ft. The lights have 4 cables (+, -, data, backup data) and the power taps are just +, -. \n\n\nMy concern is as follows - the box that controls the lights converts 120v AC into 6.5v 40a DC. However, the board seems to have no fuse whatsoever on the DC side of things. During install by one tech, the first power tap was shorted and the cable jackets inside melted. I believe the hot wire should have an inline fuse in it to prevent this. I believe there is a major potential fire hazard if the led cable is shorted before the first led light or a power tap is shorted. \n\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Should this type of system have some sort of fuse on it? Should the system not power down when shorted? I have included a photo that shows the bus bars of the power system. The open slots are where a \"power tap\" would be installed. https://ibb.co/Yh5X3Rp\n\n\nThank you. ",

A small surge protector may be beneficial, but not as necessary as fused protection. In the event of an overcurrent you would be relying on the wire melting before any of the circuit boards melted and hope that none of it starts a fire. Might not be a common issue to be concerned about, but still something to be protected against.",

      "selftext": "Hello,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have been facing an issue of my fluorescent lights mostly not working in my garage. I have 3 fixtures and each contains 2 bulbs. When I purchased my house 2 of 3 fixtures worked. Not a big deal, it was enough to satisfy me. Eventually, 1of 3 worked. I decided I would replace all of the fluorescent bulbs with new fluorescent bulbs and ensure all of my lights worked.  After doing this, I was back to 1 of 3 fixtures working. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot willing to give up, I recognized it was very cold outside and I had read online that fluorescent lights might not work when it's below 0 so I decided to install replacement [Phillips LEDs](http://www.usa.lighting.philips.com/prof/led-lamps-and-tubes/led-tubes/corepro-ledtube-instantfit-t8/929001343504_NA/product) which I thought were drop-in replacements. Maybe I'm wrong on that? Needless to say, after installing the LEDs I was down to only one bulb in one of my fixtures working. A couple of weeks have gone by and as of today, no fixtures work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI asked an electrician to take a look at it and he has proposed the below 2 options. TBH, I don't know what the right call is here. I'm looking for Reddit's input on which is the better option for my garage lighting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOption A: Repair for fluorescent lamps:\n\n• Demo 1 – ballast from each of 3 existing 4’ 2-lamp (T8 style) fluorescent light fixtures\n\n• Install 3 – new fluorescent ballasts in fixtures above\n\nNote: Customer will supply new fluorescent lamps for fixtures.\n\nPrice (Labor and Materials): $281.00\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOption B: Repair for Type B LED lamps:\n\n• Demo 1 – ballast from each of 3 existing 4’ 2-lamp (T8 style) fluorescent light fixtures\n\n• Re-wire – all three fixtures to make compatible with Type B LED lamps\n\nNote: Customer will supply Type B LED lamps for fixtures.\n\nPrice (Labor and Materials): $189.00\\*",

I thought I could just add the dimmer switch and use the existing 3 way to the fixture box but then I realized the hot and common seems a hot mess. Is this shit commonplace for residential from that era or was the electrician a wizard of the time? ..not to mention there are like 4 14-2 and 2 14-3 going into a single box in the ceiling for the first switches light... uhg.

Seems like the first hot used the darn three way incorrectly from the get go.. some how this all ends up working as is..\n\nI tired to color code it with colored pencil yellow for white.  ..

Although the ower which supplied the lights bought 25ft lengths and we had to use 2 different strips plugged into 2 different locations and it had 2 different remotes for colors etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know there are alot of different options so my biggest question is for you residential folks that may have some experience with these strip lights.\n\nWhat are you installing? I know there are so many different types to run. \n\nAre you putting a switched outlet in the cabinet then just plugging in your stip lights when the cabinet guys are done? Are you hard wiring the strip lights to a transformer and getting the DC strip lights?\n\nI know everyone will have their preferred method of doing it, just wanting to get some ideas before it's time or me to start wiring the house.",

Painting the cable is an easy way to make it disappear, but removing caulk on the baseboards, tucking the wire behind it, and recaulking it, is the best solution I found. Transformer hides inside the box with the outlet, and the cable comes out through a hole in the wall just above the baseboard, where I do the previous to hide it.",

A 40 degree wide flood is about 7.2 feet.  \n\nA typical rule of thumb is to divide the height of the ceiling by 2 for the spacing - ie. 10 foot ceiling put lights every 5 feet - 8 foot ceiling, every 4 feet beause the beam spreads more the higher you go and you also lose intensity per the inverse square law that states you lose the square of the distance you're away so at 8 feet you are getting 1/64th of the intensity of the light vs. 1/100th at 10 feet but  you'll start losing your mind if you're too analytic about it. \n\nJust go every 5 feet and buy 40 degree 1000 lumen bulbs and put an LED dimmer and you'll be fine.

      "selftext": "Portland Oregon\n\nEmbarrassed to say how many hours (days) I've wasted trying to figure this out, but here's what I found.\n\nBackground: Gutted my basement, added a living room, bedroom, and bathroom. At this point all inspections passed and ready for cover. Added 4 AFCI breakers (bathroom, bedroom, living room lights, living room sockets). **The living room has 14 LED retrofit recessed lights** (the kind you put in recessed cans where you screw in a LED/baffle into the recessed can bulb socket)\n\nProblem: AFCI breakers keep tripping. At this point, only thing hooked up are lights. Crazy thing is that sometimes they'd trip quickly, sometimes not for hours.\n\nFact 1: One circuit will trip another breaker. For example, turning on living room lights will trip bedroom breaker eventually.\n\nFact 2: When living room lights were off, all other breakers worked fine.\n\nFact 3: There are no shared neutrals. During troubleshooting, I even ran another wire from the breaker box to bedroom lights. Turned on living room, bedroom breaker still tripped (quickly or within a few hours)\n\nFact 4: I replaced all breakers, etc... no change.\n\nFact 5: I rewired all the bedroom lights, thinking there must be a problem somewhere. No change.\n\nFact 6: Turns out when living room lights are on, it will randomly over time trip all the AFCI breakers.\n\n**How I solved it**: F'ing LED retrofits. When I replace them with regular bulbs, everything works great. Somehow having 15 led retrofits in the livingroom is tripping the other breakers.\n\nHas anyone else seen this happen (even without LED dimmers)????",

I've seen my apprentices just throw all the neutrals together without a care in the world. I've even seen them through 2 hots from different circuits together. you could even use a clamp meter to confirm your hots and neutrals carry the same amperage.\n\n-neucence tripping from old appliances or power tools. basically motors with brushes on them that basically allow for arcing for the motor to work.\n\n-or you actually have an arcing problem.\n\nmaybe share a photo of the panel?\n\nedit,\nalso, the LED trend to cause the AFI breakers to trip easier because of all the circuitry in them. where incandescent bulbs just have a single wire in them.\ndoesn't mean that they are the issue, they are just making it apparent.\n\nmaybe the bulbs are either cheap or a bulb or 2 are faulty?\n\nand unfamiliar with us code (Canadian here) do you need afci for lighting?",

I read online half the distance of the ceiling, away from wall. I plan on installing 3 per room (3 points farthest from the entrance doors)\n\nIm running 2 circuits up to the Attic right now to accommodate the expected 11-12 I plan to install (bedrooms/hallway/bathroom) and my mini server/wireless router/modem Could someone tell me if I need to install a special can light and if these are 5-6inch fitted, which is best to get? 5\"? Link and video would be appreciated if someone vouches for the install video*\n\nHow many could I run or draw power to; using a single 15a circuit, including the switches http://www.homedepot.com/p/Lutron-Maestro-150-Watt-Single-Pole-3-Way-Multi-Location-Digital-CFL-LED-Dimmer-White-MACL-153MH-WH/203486488\n\nI have a ton of extra 14/3 - would it be bad practice or form to run it and just spend the extra for 14/2?\n\nAlso - If i have a box already for the that is a toggle switch for the LED lit ceiling fan, do i need to swap it for a LED dimmer switch? or is the switch just pushing/drawing too much power and could reduce the life of the 2xe12 bulbs currently installed? and lastly what is the best type of box to use so that I can fit two dimmers 1x for the LEDs and 1 for the LED lit ceiling fan.\n\n\nThanks\n\n\n",

It can also handle 600 watts of regular loads.  They did this because people would think they could put 600 watts of LED's and blow out the dimmers but I digress.  http://www.lutron.com/TechnicalDocumentLibrary/369613a.pdf\n\nRule of thumb?  Well, don't put it under fans or you'll get a headache. It's all a matter of taste and design really so you'd need to get a lighting designer to get the \"right\" answer.  Generally you want the angle of the beam to overlap a little so you don't get dark spots and that depends on the height of the ceiling, the beam of the light, and how much output they have.  \n\nFor the box, get the deepest boxes they sell.  You'll need it with dimmers.   You can use 14/3 if you know what you're doing and don't get things mixed up and cap things properly.  You can tap off that later if you decide to add art lights and you've already put up your walls.  \n",

Rewiring with new dimmer switches to 110v and directly powering the fixture with AC current is impractical. Is there a way to add a remote wireless dimming/power switching capability? I saw something about a Lutron RMJ PowPak and I wonder if that might be centrally wired up by the main 110v feed to the low voltage distributor switchbox in the attic. Then I could add remote wireless dimmer switches to each room, and eliminate the need for the old low voltage switches. Am I on the right track? Is this something an amateur with mediocre fix-it skills can handle, or do I need a pro to figure it out? Thanks.",

They dim better than other bulbs I've seen too and do testing on that with a list of approved dimmers on the site somewhere.   I still think that the best way to go is with bulbs and have said that from the beginning. \n\n\nI was at a lighting presentation for famous manufacturer 4 years ago who was showing off their new LED recessed lights and at the time, they were very nice indeed. The obvious problem I saw was that LED or not, eventually those things would burn out - maybe in 5 years, maybe in 10 years, or hell, maybe in a year. Do you really want to trust ONE company to be around and have the exact identical replacement part for your house?  The other problem is that technology is rapidly improving. Older LED bulbs barely dimmed and only with very specific dimmers, their color temperatures were inconsistent, and the lumens they put out were not great.  In the last 4 years alone there has been a tremendous amount of improvement and those who bought those LED cans have to change the entire can and spend thousands of dollars on labor, parts, and possibly drywall repair while those with the bulbs can just put in the nicer bulbs as they burn out. \n\nAs far as insulation goes, I'm not convinced that there is enough heat/cooling loss through the cans to justify all the potential headaches of overheating cans.

I used these [LED retrofit lights from amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01A0PKKMW/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&th=1) along with two [LED dimmer switches](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Lutron-Diva-150-Watt-Single-Pole-3-Way-White-Indoor-Dimmer/3736413). The lights were separated into 2 zones with 5 lights on one switch and 6 on the other.\n\nAt first I had no issues and they dimmed as expected. Recently, in the past month, I have noticed that they have a noticeable hum to them. This hum is loudest when the lights are dimmed half way and less noticeable when very dim or full brightness.\n\nI thought the dimmer switch may be the issue and so I switched them out for [these dimmers from Costco](http://www.costco.com/FEIT-Dimmer-Switch%2C-4-pack.product.100307412.html?pageSize=96&catalogId=10701&keyword=FEIT+dimmer&langId=-1&storeId=10301). If anything, they light hum even louder with the new dimmers.\n\nAny reason why they would start humming months after install? Any suggestions for troubleshooting?

Maybe try changing out to a non-dimming simple switch to see if that changes things. Though that may not help you because for me, dimming is a necessity.",

Except, I am wondering about a possible over-heating failure of the driver and of course the connections outside a box in a ceiling cavity with insulation. As well as the LED fixture itself over-heating because of poor airflow in that cavity.\n\nWhat is anyone's take on the 'real' possibility of a fire hazard in that situation?\n\nI know the wire nut connections outside a box are a code no-no, but what is the likelihood that those (probably wrapped in electrical tape) could potentially cause a fire?\n\nAnd, if the AC driver were to fail, is there a fire hazard there?\n\nThere are no UL listing stamps/claims on this product and given the price and manufacturing location, I am a little suspicious of the component quality and QC.\n\nI've suggested my friend send them back and pay up for retrofit LED lighting that includes an IC rated can and box for the wiring.",

The cost is like 30-40x higher than a toggle switch and it doesn’t help the consumer at all. In fact it barely saves energy costs given how little power LEDs actually use.\n\nI do a lot of Finals on residential homes and I can’t tell you how often I’m working on a live panel when the lights go out because I’m not triggering the sensor with movement. We literally have a guy sometimes stand there and trigger the sensor just so we can work if the garage door won’t open.\n\nI see so many old folks homes where the garage is PACKED full of stuff, and I can imagine them walking in there looking for something and suddenly the lights go out. Now they’re stuck navigating through pitch black through all their stuff. It isn’t safe, it saves barely any energy, and makes the corporations millions. \n\nStop this shit ASAP\n",

I am competing with larger companies that seem to have dirt cheap prices on materials. Where do you guys (contractors) purchase your lights from?",

Do they run 11% cash back, NO!  But we get bulk contractor pricing, the guys aren't fighting poor fixture quality, and the money stays local.\n\nI do understand, trying to be frugal with pricing, but if it's only a matter of a couple bucks a fixture, is it that important?  Are customers really canceling contracts over fixture price?  Unfortunately, your bid price should be reflective of the market to stay competitive.

It's a fairly straightforward job but I still decided it would be in my best interest to go to site and take a look to make sure I can quote them properly. \n\nI go to the new clients house, get the run down on what they want done and while I'm there I see that they have purchased 10 of the 12 fixtures they want replaced. With the other two set to arrive within the week. \n\n Typically I provide materials with a markup etc, but if they got a screaming deal on some fixtures and want to provide them that's okay too.\n\n I make sure to reiterate the quote I'm providing them is based on the fixtures being either the same make/model or at the very least the same ease of install. \n\nOriginally they balked at the quote I provided and I'll admit I high balled it a bit but the work was also dead simple so I caved. After a bit of back and forth we agreed on a price and that was that.\n\nFast forward a few days and I get the call that the lights have arrived, so we set a time up and I head on over to do a simple install job... \n\nTurns out the two lights on order were not In fact \"simple\" replacements but pendant style chandeliers with varying lengths of pendants that would take as long to put together and install as my entire estimate for the whole job. \n\nI told them I would not be proceeding with this portion of the install and after a short discussion  it was obviously a lost cause and I packed my shit up and left. \n\nIm feeling pretty dumb over the whole ordeal but if I don't stand up for myself no one will. My time is valuable and if you aren't interested in being honest with your intentions and try to pull a fast one then I'm walking. \n\nAnyways have a safe weekend y'all! \nHere's to the next one lol.",

After a few years, I stepped away to try trucking, but quickly realized that wasn’t for me.\n\nI ended up getting into the oilfield and have been working out of state on a 3x3 schedule for the last couple of years, with the past year as a foreman. The money and schedule are good — not life-changing, but solid — and I appreciate those two things.\n\nThat said, I’m honestly getting tired of the culture up here: the drama, the big corporate BS, and just the overall vibe. So now I’m at a point in my life where I feel ready to try my own thing — not build a huge company, just work for myself, maybe with a helper, doing smaller service jobs and projects.\n\nThe challenge: I’ve been out of my local market for a few years. Most of my old contacts are long gone, and I’m not really sure how to re-enter the scene. I still have my electrical contractor license, so I’m covered there.\n\nWould you quit the oilfield job and find something local for a bit to rebuild connections and get a feel for how things work again?\n\nOr try to land small gigs during my 3 weeks off and build from there (though inspections and scheduling while I’m away might be tricky)?\n\t\nOr maybe I’m just overthinking it?\n\nAppreciate any advice from folks who’ve made a similar leap or started over in a city without a strong local network.",

I want to avoid the engineering stamp, is there any other option? This is for a residential.\n\nIf not, I guess you will find it on eBay real soon! Thanks for any guidance!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sudv40csptgc1.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=b391dd5327e67aa0df434bdf831234f85f155cce\n\nEDIT:   \nFirst and for most, thanks to everyone who made & express their opinion in this thread, great learning experience.   \n\n\nI consulted with 2 PE in Electrical Engineering with 30+ years of experience, their credentials includes: certifications in IEEE C37.59, NICET LIV, ANSI/NETA MTS, DoD specific, etc. These guys are the ones who designs the power systems for the datacenters in Ashburn, VA.  \n\n\nThey told me that that particular wire (along with other types like DLO, etc) are often specified to be installed directly on the generators to the first switch boards and ATSs (specially the ones that are not solid state), the way those things vibrate when starts is insane, and more often with the big boy EPGs (40' container size).  \nThey explained me that everything that their team design seems to be over-provisioned but in reality, there are systems that must endure the most hardcore scenarios, they explain me how critical is to maintain multiple generators and UPS systems in sync phase, or when something even in arc fault, their gear has to withstand it all... even in full blown short until the N+x backup systems are ready to join in perfect sync. They told me, imagine a breaker that is absolutely screaming and melting just waiting for a generator to achieve the perfect speed to finally trip, just for an example.  \n\n\nAnd yes, there is a process for all that, they mentioned a form in the IEEE C37.63, C37.30.1 etc that they often use which includes: Specific Intent of Conversion, Completed Conversion Ratings (Continuous (A), Bus Bracing Study, VR, K-Factor, Arc Chute, Asymmetrical/Symmetrical kA... you get the idea.  \n\n\nTheir recommendation was: it's really a great wire for the intended use (they even calculated the de-rated in conduit for me, 180amps) they even pulled the latest UL E file from iQ, but in reality the beauty of that wire is that it can withstand 250 without any issue in conduit for a very long period of time, they even suggest to use it in parallel for future expansion, meanwhile the pad transformer arrives in a couple of years.   \n\n\nTheir main rationale is this: imagine a 200amp resi panel pulling 198 amps continuous 24/7... that thing will generate so much heat, that in the long run, you will have bigger problems in less than 3yrs, this wire won't even sweat. But because the client is going to have his transformer in less than that period and remove the drops to switch to the CT, it's a wise future investment.  \n\n\nThey can write a letter, along with all the study and design stamped  (apparently super easy for them of course LOL) and the AHJ inspector won't even try to fight it because most probably, they won't even know half the math presented to them, the IBC, IFC allow it using the design method.  \n\n\n**Conclusions:**  \n1.- Yes, it's possible and is often done in the big leagues.   \n2.- It will be a killer build, future proof, cheaper only because I have a full 1000' reel that I can put in critical areas like the battery banks.  \n3.- My AHJ and their buddies will put me in the banned list for life because apparently there is a thing between EEs and AHJs? like nemesis or something. I would called that just plain ego both ways.  \n4.- \"Yes, the code is the minimum\", but only when you over provision using what's there apparently.  \n5.- Yes, there are cool AHJ inspectors out there that can appreciate state of the art work & craftsmanship (not like I do state or the art of course), or they might not care.  \n\n\nSo based on the pros and cons: yes, the client will be more than happy to have better materials at better price, I could win this quote (just because I already have the wire)... but because #3, that will do more harm for me in future projects.  \n\n\nI'm going to prepare a formal report with all my findings along with the breakdown costs using regular XHHW, at least the client will know that I was really trying to get him the best bang for his bucks.  \n\n\n**Again, thank y'all for your input!... if interested, DM with your best offer for that reel.**  \n",

      "selftext": "\n\nHey guys, I started my own electrical company about 6 months ago — mostly did residential jobs until now. Just picked up my first real light commercial project, and I’m wondering if the way I priced it makes sense.\n\nRight before construction holidays I started this retrofit + basic automation job in an office:\n\t•\tSwapping old fluorescent lights for LEDs\n\t•\tAdding motion sensors\n\t•\t0-10V dimming\n\t•\tProgramming lighting controllers\n\nWe’re in Montreal, open ceiling, and it’s just me and another journeyman. We’re averaging 1 light per billed hour, including:\n\t•\tRunning low voltage\n\t•\tFixing junction boxes\n\t•\tInstalling plates\n\t•\tProgramming\n\t•\tLight cleanup\n\nSo far we’ve done 22 hours for 22 lights, and there’s probably another 20 hours of work left.\n\n⸻\n\n💰 I charged:\n\t•\t$120/hour (labour)\n\t•\t$65/light (materials included)\n→ So about $2,640 in labour + $2,400 in materials = $5,000 before tax\n\nClient’s happy, no complaints at all. I’m also declaring everything properly with CCQ and have the right permits — keeping it clean.\n\nAre my rates unreasonable?",

      "selftext": "Hey guys, I am a journeyman electrician that mainly does commercial and light industrial work. I have been asked to install a NEMA 1450 receptacle at my uncles house for where an EV charger may be in the future. I’ve done a couple Tesla chargers but that was about a decade ago. My questions are these: (any good advice is appreciated and welcome) TIA \n\n1: I’m putting 6awg with a 10awg ground on a 50amp breaker. The run is less than 20’\nDo they make residential romex as big as 6awg. Is this a job for an S/O cable or what is proper? What is standard? I don’t really wanna run conduit unless I have to. \n\n2. My preliminary research turned up a lot of stuff about 1450 receptacles and EV chargers resulting in fires. Is there any evidence or data to support this? Assuming a professional and workman like installation everything should be fine right? Is there something I’m missing? \n\n3. They have a 225 amp service. The house was a custom build when they bought it and they’ve always had more than they need or use service wise. However, I only have one free breaker space. I was going to use a tandem breaker on an indoor lighting circuit that I recently converted to LEDs to free up the space I need for the 2 pole 50. Any suggestions or potential issues with this plan? \n\nAlso, if there is something I’m missing or any pointers you guys have I would appreciate it. It seems like a pretty straightforward installation to me and I feel more than capable of the work, but I like to be thorough if I can be. Took a couple pictures if that helps. They’re of the panel and about 15’ away my only attic access to get above it. Thanks again! ",

Here in the PNW we have some code on EV Chargers and PV systems that go above and beyond NEC.\n\nDon't run SO or SOOW cable if you don't have to... It can be more expensive than EMT and THHN... Quick and dirty ain't always right...\n\n6/3 NMB is definitely a product... And it's pretty inexpensive compared to running EMT, Rigid, SO/SOOW... You can get it from any Home Depot/Lowe's/Menards...\n\nGrab yourself a EV Rated 14-50R (Leviton makes a good one)... They're rated for the amount of usage you'll have from an EV Charger... And the contacts inside are heavy duty (I'd even go so far as to say industrial grade).\n\nI would run some kind of conduit for future proofing... Can be EMT, FMC, ENT, LFMC, PVC... Whatever you feel is best for the location you're in.... Especially if it's only 20 foot away... EMT would be easy, pending what your local codes say... Plus if you're in some bigger cities... They might require conduit... I wanna say Chicago requires EMT for resi....\n\nAnd last... Permit Permit Permit!\n Permitting helps your uncle with future insurance claims if it ever comes up. And pending where you put that EV Charger... Theft may be an issue with the charging cable...\n\nSorry for the rant... I know a lot of industrial guys that do t know jack about resi...

We’re offering competitive pay, benefits, and opportunities for certification, but the challenge right now is finding people who are already in this niche field or have relevant experience.\n\nHas anyone here hired for this kind of work before?

With no voltage on the 2 hots\n\nIs this neutral being backed by a completelt different circuit in some hidden junction box?  Is this just a sign of a wire that shorted on multiple wires?\n\nI wish I had the go ahead to just pull the 3 suspected 12-3s out, it's very hard to troubleshoot hot in a commercial building with customer traffic and vital computers\n\n\nThere was a second 12-2 switch loop home run shitfuck wtf circuit as well, and when I unspliced that, and pulled that neutral off, a printer and emergency light (LED) started flickering with what you can almost hear as very consistent deliberate voltage instability...\n\nIf I end up going back there at some point, what's my next step?  I'm pretty sure I just trace this wire all the way through the plate and pull it out of the panel, but I'm getting the feeling it's not going to be that simple, I don't understand how this 12-3 neutral is energized at 113 with both hots\n\nThis is in America jsyk",

      "selftext": "Where are you putting the power supplies? Class 2 is limited to 100W, which realistically means an ~80W power budget per circuit. High-quality LED strips are pushing 5.5W/ft, so even a small kitchen with 20ft of under/over cabinet lighting on one wall requires 110W. This means two separate controllers and power supplies for just one wall. For larger kitchen walls, even using lower W/ft strips, the power requirements quickly exceed 80–100W.\n\nAre you centralizing the power supplies somewhere in a box? Is there a product specifically designed for multiple isolated Class 2 circuits? Retrofitting for old work also seems messy because it would require multiple pluggable Class 2 power bricks, which aren’t exactly small.\n\nAlso what controllers are you using for UL/ETL listings? Does the inspector care? TRIAC/dimmer driver setups are straight forward in this, but RGB/W not so much. ",

          "body": "So if we’re doing it as affordable as possible we use a Leviton vented low voltage panel to house our transformers. We either get the 14” or the 21”(?) enclosure. We usually hide these in pantry’s or adjacent closets just like the data guys would. We install outlets in the bottom of the panel and hook the outlets to a switch. We purchase transformers from magnitude, fwiw they have up to I believe 300w single transformers. We wire a plug and cord to the transformer so it’s a simple plug for service, it also keeps us code compliant so there’s no exposed 120v conductors in the panel. Then we run our low voltage wire from the panel to our light locations in an array so we may have 7-10 stubs for an entire kitchen. \n\nOn larger installs we use the magnitude jbzn e-series panels. They’re a little expensive, but when you factor in the labor reduction they’re about the same cost. You can spec them 12 or 24v, with 60 or 96w transformers, up to a total of 8 transformers. They’re setup for zone control with a DIN rail block for your 120v conductors and low voltage connections. You can spec triac (phase cut) or 0-10v dimming protocol when you order. \n\n[magnitude lighting control panel](https://marvel-pim.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media/ZsAa7dfW2yr1xFHZ0QF2yOlD3zDy557qTrI9rG5W.pdf)\n\nSome of the magnitude transformers are setup for both 0-10v or triac but it’s not really worth the extra cost for the transformers unless you know ahead of time because nobody’s going to pull the 0-10v signal wire unless it’s what’s being spec’d. We have pulled nm-b duo cable from the switch to the transformer before so there can be backwards compatibility between triac and 0-10v. 0-10v isn’t really worth it unless you’re doing another form of integration that requires it, or you need dimming to less than 1%.",

I have never really had to apply or interview so am new to the whole process. Have done a little bit of everything with them, light commercial and residential, but want experience working mainly in commercial as it would be different and challenging as well as educational. \n\nWhat kind of information would you want on a resume, what would you want to know from me or about me as a potential employee? Would you want me to submit some sort of formal application, introduce myself etc?\n\nJust curious as to get your guys perspective, any helpful input would be appreciated. \n\nHave a nice weekend to everyone reading this.

This is a rural house.\n\nMost houses in town have switched from the 35/50 watt MR16s they had a few years back to LED wafers and walking at night allows me to see some dimmed modules, others strobing, turning on-off repeatedly, yellow-ish light that was previously white (people here love 6500K lights), and of course dead ones.

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, first time poster here. \n\nI'm a first year apprentice, and as my first at home project I decided to swap out a light at my mom's house with one that they were giving away at work for free. \n\nThe ones that they were giving away at work are the flat Led lights that can be retrofitted directly into cans, so what I did was first disconnect the fixture that was in place (incandescent), followed by clipping off the orange connector at the end of the hot/neutral of the light so that I could directly splice it to the switch leg.\n\nI wanted to try it with both lights that I have, and got it to work once with the 2700k light, but when I tried the 5000k light it doesn't turn on, and after some trial and error realized that this happens as soon as I connect the neutrals together between the SL and the light. What's causing this, and what are my options here? \n\nThis light is in a kitchen over a sink, and connected to a dimmer switch. Initially I had problems finding the breaker for it, so when I touched the hot to the ground to trip it the GFI went off and so it is also connected to that. \n\nAlso, I plan on taking the box out to directly mount the light to the drywall with the clips on the side of it. Any thoughts on what I'm doing wrong?",

      "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nRecently converted several old fluorescents to LED with ballast bypass bulbs. Everything has been fine for several months. But I now have 3 rooms where the lights are no longer turning on. Okay, I thought maybe the lights were duds.\nSwapped them into functioning fixtures, bulbs work fine. Bulbs from the functioning fixtures do not work in the 3 rooms. 120 between L and N, L and ground. 0.51v between N and ground. N has continuity with ground. Tombstones are all getting 120. \n\nI’m willing to accept that maybe I’m missing something obvious here, but does anyone have any ideas? ",

I generally have to build scaffolding or use an ignorantly large little giant ladder to get to some of thr cans, so I was wondering if anyone can recommend an actually good version of those awful lightbulb changing suction cup kits. We have one of the cheapo ones from home depot or whatever, but a lot of the time the cans have been retrofitted for LED spots and they're just too tight to the trim. Any help appreciated! ",

Now they want the lens to match the frosted appearance of the lenses in that section.\nOkay cool, more money.

If needed, throw a pipe clamp and run a temp ground wire from one of the registers (most places with knob and tube are usually boiler heated up here in Viking Country). That way you have a known ground to measure from. Sometimes seeking neutrals will give you wonky voltages....as in you will see 60v on a 120 circuit. Having a known ground can help sort things out.",

      "selftext": " \n\nI am a maintenance technician in a factory. Recently, I have undertaken the task of changing the high bay fluorescent lights, which are of various sizes (T5, T8, T12,) and types (single-lamp and multi-lamp) that are not working in the warehouse. This project was, compared to my other duties, supposed to be one of the easiest, yet it is one of the less intellectually challenging, most mind-numbing, and most quite frustrating endeavors. \n\nI have been working on two neighboring 6-lamp T8-Fluorescent High Bay Light Fixtures, whose neither of the tubes lights up. I have performed all the tests I am aware of to identify the issue of this type of lighting, to no avail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I have checked all the twelve tombstone sockets of each fixture by inserting the tip of a non-contact voltage tester, and I could detect voltage in each one of them.\n* I have checked the continuity with a multimeter on the base pins of each tube, and I obtained a beep with a resistance value ranging between 2 ohms through 8.5 ohms for each one of them.\n* I have taken an overview of the connections from the ballast to each receptacle socket, and everything seems normal.\n\nHowever, despite all those verifications, none of the 12 fluorescent lamps is lighting up. I became frustrated and gave up. I contemplate procrastinating - which have been doing for the last two months - the completion of that project until my mood improves. Because, I usually work on that whenever there is a lull in my timetable at work. Even though, when I walk past an area where there are lights that are not functioning, seeing those is tantamount to having a pebble in my shoe that I keep ignoring.\n\n  \nTherefore, I would like to know a comprehensive checklist of proven, time-saving, efficient, infallible methods to test fluorescent lights/lighting fixtures (ballast, receptacle sockets) so that I could complete my project without having to throw away potentially good lamps or to replace ballasts (unless I am certain they are not good and have exhausted all options). Any relevant suggestions are much appreciated. Thank you very much beforehand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \n***P.S***  I think I have been straightforward in posing my question. Please do not go off topic by suggesting replacing the lamps with LED tubes or engage in any other philosophical, financial, political squabbles about their economic and environmental benefits. I am just a mere technician at the company, who does not hold the strings of the purse. As such, I am expected to solve practical problems to satisfy the expectations from me of my hierarchy. I would rather gat a single practical relevant answer than an off-topic rant that would waste both our precious times. By all means, do not look for a polar bear in the Sahara desert.  \n***STAY AWAY FROM NEGATIVE PEOPLE, THEY HAVE A PROBLEM FOR EVERY SOLUTION.***  \n",

It has always been more time/cost-effective to just install new ballasts instead of trying to test ballasts. That is after verifying the wiring is correct/intact. Older magnetic ballasts can sometimes be intermittent due to temperature.\n\nI understand your comment your comment about LEDs, but just hear me out for a second. We are in a process of converting a lot of fixtures to Bypass or Hybrid LED tubes. If we do them as a project, we get rebates from the utility provider as well as the federal government through \"inflation reduction act\" right up front. By the time those rebates are applied, the LED tubes are way cheaper than standard fluorescent lamps. The return on investment from energy savings is less than 6 months. And if you do bypass lamps, there is no longer a ballast to worry about. It's something worth approaching your supervisor about and really easy to calculate projected cost savings.",

      "selftext": "Hey Sparkies 👋 Home DIYer and hobbyist here with a very random question pertaining to electrical code.\n\nI'm building a new house, and a couple of rooms will have more sophisticated controls (multiple dimming zones, low-voltage LEDs with multiple channels, individually-controlled outlets, etc.) Rather than doing a ton of home runs back to something like a Control4 panel, I'd like to keep the equipment closer to the rooms in something like a recessed equipment panel with a DIN rail. I'd like to terminate the room's outlets/lighting in that panel using traditional industrial DIN-mounted contact blocks, and then THHN to Leviton Omni-Bus dimmer modules (also DIN-mounted) or DIN-mounted DMX LED dimmer packs.\n\nMy questions are as follow: \n\n1. What code applies to something that looks closer to an industrial control cabinet in a residential setting?\n2. Industrial panels often intermix low-voltage (0-24V, for my purposes) and high-voltage (120V) – with appropriate separation for things like contactors, etc. Is this possible in my situation?\n3. I have to imagine that this overall concept is possible (as long as the equipment and panel are agency-rated), since things like Control4 lighting automation panels are basically the equivalent. Am I thinking about this the wrong way? If so, how would you achieve a similar effect?\n\nI've got an electrical engineering background, and I'm reasonably familiar with NEC in the context of residential work – so hopefully you don't have to dumb things down too much for me. Thanks in advance for taking the time to reply! 🙏",

Smart controls have planned obsolescence built in these days. I probably wouldn’t bring the outlets back to relays as it’s a pain in the ass to have switched outlets and there isn’t really a great reason to do it. \n\nI used to think this was a great idea, and then I tallied up cost, complexity, software, and obsolescence. In the end, the parts of my home that I wanted smartened up are done with Philips Wiz and some Tuya plug-in modules. It’s not as interesting as DMX packs but it works, it’s cheap, and someone else does the software.",

That's probably good advice.\n\nOne thing I don't understand: when I do other electrical work that needs to mix low- and high-voltage (as defined above), I can't mix them in the same junction box without a separation barrier. A recent example was selecting a [pilot relay](https://www.functionaldevices.com/products/building-automation/details/RIBTU1C/) to control a 120V Energy Recovery Ventilation fan from 24V equipment. Why do I need this physical separation in a junction box, but not in an industrial controls panel? Is it just the rating of the enclosure? Fill? Something else?",

I have been doing this work since I was 18 chasing money but am ready to take the pay cut and get a long term career being a real electrician working in town. Most of my work consisted of just retrofitting light fixtures or replacing them completely but would also be doing a lot of troubleshooting, and running entirely new circuits sometimes. I kind of assumed these hours wouldn’t count as there is a-lot more to electrical than lighting but wondered since I was working under an electrical contractor maybe I could get something out of my experience to make it where I wouldn’t have to start at the very bottom of the barrel.

Government takes 1/3rd of your pay, company takes 1/3rd for operating expenses (insurances, vehicles, equipment, accountants, phones, your pay taxes, et. al) and growth, you get 1/3 to keep for yourself. Then you add the cost of materials, generally around a 40% markup but some people do 100%, some do 10%; that is all up to you. What is your time to replace the hardest device? Double that amount of time at a minimum for all the devices; that is a general rule of thumb, replacing the device is only half the work time of installation, making sure they work correctly takes time and you can end up spending an hour trouble shooting the one device that doesn't work correctly. you also have to figure in the time it takes to get the materials and to from the job.\n\nThe biggest problem people have early on in their business is underestimating the value of their work thinking they can make it up eventually. Don't work for yourself so you struggle to earn a living. I did a job once for $1,600, as the owner was paying me they let it slip that the next contractor quote above mine was for $4,800.

They're 5000K which is terrible for indoors and two of them flicker or only sometimes light. I figured they were one-piece deals and would be a pain to replace, so I've been putting it off.\n\nWell today I pulled down one that doesn't work and I found an Eaton E26 housing! The lights are one-piece retrofits with integrated trim and a socket adapter. Call me old fashioned but I miss replaceable bulbs. For $5 each I ordered standard trim rings and now I can switch them all back to LED bulbs.\n\nI was expecting this to be a project but I feel like I won the lighting lottery.

      "selftext": "Hey,\n \n I'm using a transformer I've never used before on a commercial job. I have 347v lights on a switch but then some pot lights (4\" lithonia Retrofit led with driver) which are 120v that need to be controlled by the same switch. So the ol supply house gave me a 347v to 120v transformer but no wiring diagram... I called and they didnt have one (they don't come in boxes). They called the supplier and they couldnt supply a wiring diagram... Weird I know.\n\nSo it's gets weirder. Two black leads to 347v hot gives 120v out on both whites then splice the neutral through. Awesome we got it! Hook up a single pot light and instantly under load voltage goes to 0 on white wires. Take it back off load and 120v is back. Tested pot lights on a extension cord from a outlet, it's working.\n\nAttempt two is one black lead to 347v hot and nothing else to see what I get. Other black lead shows 347v too now. Whites both individually or together show 120v. Try pot light and voltage drops to 2v under load. \n\nAttempt three...rethinking life, let's put one black to hot 347v and one black to 347v neutral (which this other black leg went live 347v last time so this should short out). It doesn't trip and the whites have 20v on one and 70v on other...\n\nSo after calling fellow jmen everyone is like wtf is happening. Now I just need the wiring diagram but have spent hours looking for it to 0 avail. So anyone got any ideas? I'm off till Monday but open to any suggestions to try when I get back on site. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/TK2Hik4",

If you are controlling more than one what you need is a relay.\n\n120V single pole single throw relay.\n\nIf you want this all in one box then it has to be larger and all wires must be labeled.\n\n347 from switch leg and a neutral to the box hooked to the transformer primaries.\n\nSecondaries to the relay A1&A2 (coil)\n\n120V & a neutral from another source into the box with clear labels stating its powered from a secondary source.\n\nHot on the common and Normally Open to the LED lights. Neutral from the 120V source to the LED pot lights.\n\nBadda bing the switch powers them lights and the transformer. The transformer powers the relay. The relay controls the other source to power the LEDs. Just make sure the relay can handle the full 15A circuit otherwise by code you will have to put fuse in the circuit.\n\n\\*Edit\\* Being a but tipsy early for Canada Day, if it is big enough to power the pot lights, you need a ground reference. \n\n347V & neutral to black wires. Take one of the 120V wires and attach it to a pigtail which is attached to a ground point and the neutral of the LED pot lights. The other wire is now going to be completely 120V hot. Take care!",

When I got weird voltages with the neutral in the mix I started to think maybe they meant double blacks on 347v and double whites on load hot wire for 120v then splice the neutral through. I mean a neutral is a neutral regardless of voltage, it's just a return path. But then it magically goes from 120v to 0v under load. It's legit hilarious to see, tap of one wire makes it go from hot to dead with no tripping or anything.",

Been a journeyman for 3 years and it's time to write the master's exam in 2 months. I'm currently employed so I do not need to quit right away and start my own shop, but eventually it is the goal. Although I appreciate the steady paycheque and material being right on the job site, it's tough having gruff foremen chasing you and I have the long-term goal of making higher income. I figure it's practical to start out in residential taking calls from homeowners, very small commercial jobs, and linking up with a couple general contractors I know.\n\n**QUESTIONS:**  \n\\-Did you take on side-jobs after work and on the weekends until you were busy enough to leave your employer? What was your transition like?  \n\\-How long did it take you to become profitable/learn how to estimate jobs properly?  \n\\-How did you make the initial capital investments like a work-van and all the tools? Did you take a small business loan from a bank?  \n\\-I've learned a lot in the commercial space, but how do you suggest learning all residential options like the lighting products so that when I speak to a homeowner I can make suggestions?\n\nThanks very much!",

I know it’s not an easy challenge but I’ve seen some guys start with taking out huge amounts in loans before even seeing what business they can capture and having to close before even really getting started (and now having random debt to pay back). Take the small service jobs that get you in and out quick to start building net worth. Don’t start with bidding commercial remodel until you can float the material and labor cost out of pocket. Staying self employed as a single man shop is easy but trying to grow to quickly will ruin you and it won’t be a reflection of your electrical knowledge.",

      "selftext": "Reaching out to see if anyone has experience with installing electrical systems in paint booths.\n\nI'm in New York, this is a side job, not being inspected but I want it to be done right and certainly safe\n\nI have a customer who has a small custom cabinet shop on the first floor of his house.\n\nHe has a room built out as a paint booth, tin walls and ceiling. He's been using this for years, it works, but he wants it to be more legit.\n\nThis booth has a temporary exhaust fan, low voltage LED lights and two outlets on a 15a circuit. These are all within the paint booth itself.\n\nHe really only needs power for lights and the new explosion proof exhaust fan he is purchasing. The fan only draws 6 amps and the LED lights probably 1/12th of an amp. \n\nPowering the fan via that 15a circuit is the easy part. My issue is the explosion proof devices and conduit system.\n\nReading up on code and finding explosion proof devices has me a bit overwhelmed. From my understanding professional setups tend to have most electrical connections/devices in a separate area from the spray booth to avoid possible ignition. If you need something in that booth it's a specially built very expensive item.\n\nA single explosion proof receptacle can run from $400-$1000. \n\nAnd the current power is roughed in as any basic residential house would be, Romex and plastic boxes. \n\nIf anyone has any experience with a situation like this I would really appreciate some advice. I'm getting to a point where I might need to tell the customer it's not necessarily feasible without spending a lot of money and reworking the room entirely. \n\nAm I overthinking the job? Or am I correct in saying that, to make it a proper up to code paint booth he would need to spend a lot of money?\n\nEdit: Seriously can't thank you guys enough for the comments and advice. I really think I needed to hear that my concerns were valid from other professionals.",

This isn’t a huge problem because I’ve been doing electrical for a few years but he did something that confuses me and I have only a few days to figure it out before the homeowner gets pissy about me not having this done.\n\nThe home owners asked for recessed lighting \n\nI thought the plan was to use wafers and cut them in after the drywall is up \n\nMy dad had one of his guys put b520a standard 4” round boxes up where the lights are going \n\nI don’t think that the drivers for the led wafer will fit in the boxes.\n\nIs there some kind of led wafer that has the driver built into it so that way it takes up less room? Anyone have any guesses as to what my dad was planning? I might have to resort to disk lights but they’re ugly as hell and not recessed, or un-attach all of the 4” rounds, push them up into the attic and then use the wafers as normal, but this requires a lot of extra work and more risk to brand new paint and drywall work. \n\nSorry for the extreme run on sentence and thank you for any help as to solving this mystery.",

      "selftext": "Hey community; I’m an apprentice residential electrician in the southern Indiana region and my boss says something I’m trying to fix and deal with is “impossible”\nI’m working on a fan in a residential house (Model is minkaAire Contractor Series Model No. F551), trying to hang it up and get it to turn on. This fan is the version that only has the fan blades, and we were not given a light to install with it.\nGetting to where the problem is; when I flip the switch, doesn’t turn on. Okay, normal issue, check connections in the canopy and in the 3G box. All are good. Black hot twists are done correctly, neutrals are all together and right, grounds are tied, 12/3 wire looks intact at the ceiling for the fan and in the box. Weird. I grab my hot stick and start testing the wires at the ceiling to see if they are working with the switch; I come to discover that when I flip either the switch that has the black from the 12/3 or the red from the 12/3, they both become hot in the ceiling. I don’t know what this means and before my boss lost service in the area he’s at he said that’s not possible.\nIf anyone has anything I can try that isn’t tearing up drywall and such please let me know when you can. I appreciate it. I hope this is a legal post and I don’t know where else to go.\n\nEdit: After testing with the multimeter, and proper tying up of the fan, it still did not work.\nI found a known-good LED puck light we had about and tried it with the red and white wires from the 12/3 that runs between the fan box and the 3G box. The puck worked as expected.\n\nCONCLUSION: Faulty fan stressed me out way to much for the day. Thank you everyone for the help, I am so incredibly grateful to everyone for their kindness and aid. Thank you all so much again!",

      "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI wanted to run a scenario by you folks in hopes to gain some outside prospective on a situation that I am currently dealing with.\n\nTL:DR\n\n1950s home that had some electrical work quoted to modernize it.  Electrician opted to not do a pre-inspection, ran into issues with the homes ceiling/attic access, running wires through wall, duct work, not having the right tools, temperature of the attic, general frustration with the work and left the job 1 day over the estimated timeline not completing the already chopped down task list.  Gave them more than half the deposit mid way through the work and they are asking for the remaining balance when only 6/16 tasks were even completed leaving several incomplete or postponed.  What would you do in this situation and what do you recommend I do?\n\nFull Story\n\nBackground of the home, my house was built in the 1950s.  I recently bought this home 4 years ago with my wife and discovered immediately the house needed some electrical updates.  Most of the light sources in the house were non-existent or stemming from area lamps.  Some rooms didn't even have overhead lighting to include our master bedroom and guest room.  Assumptions could be made that whoever did the work on the additions previously wasn't very forward thinking and as a result any work on this home becomes a big project.\n\nI hired a master electrician, older gentleman, Husband/Wife company that we've employed in the past to do the following work on my home estimated at 3 days labor and $2250.00 including material.  They stated they would bill on their day rate and did no pre inspection before quoting the work.  We insisted that they take a look around the house/attic/basement to make sure they knew what to anticipate but they declined.\n\n16 Tasks\n\nGeneral\n\n • replace any remaining flip switches with white paddles switches (x9)\n\n • put cover on garage circuit breaker panel\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDen\n\n • add 2 recessed lights and convert switch to a dimmer\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOffice\n\n • add 2 recessed lights and new dimmer switch\n\n • add 1 light to closet\n\n • add 1 new 2 plug outlet\n\n • repair/replace 1 existing outlet\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKitchen\n\n • add 8 recessed lights to existing junction and convert switch to dimmer\n\n • add new switch to existing lighting to be controlled from a 3rd access point\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLiving Room\n\n • replace 3 existing pot lights with newly provided recessed LEDs and convert switches to dimmers\n\n • add 2 recessed lights to existing lighting/switching\n\n • add 1 recessed light with independent switch\n\n • convert a 2 plug outlet to a 4 plug outlet\n\n • add 1 new 2 plug outlet\n\n • move a switch located in the master bedroom that controls the attic light to an adjacent wall outside of the bedroom\n\n • run a C wire for a thermostat\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk so I'm just going to start from the beginning from my point of view and hopefully it has some kind of cohesion to you the reader.\n\nBefore the work started, emails went back and forth about the cost and time.  A final estimate was to be sent and received so that we could provide half the cost up front as a deposit before the work began.  We never heard from them and had to reach out to them to request the final quote which they ultimately never sent.\n\nJune 9th, Day - 1 (4-5 hours total)\n\nThe first day the Electrician shows up an hour after the scheduled time with a helper (not an apprentice or journeyman) to assist with snaking cable and whatever else and begin casing the house.  We provided them with all the recessed lighting for the tasks, provided an itemized list of what we had requested and stayed out of their way as they got to work.  They spent some time preparing the recessed lighting and decided to start with the kitchen lighting first.  After no exaggeration 2-3 hours of making 4 cut out holes in the ceiling it was expressed that they were running into difficulty because behind the drywall was another layer of material that was very hard to cut through with their hole saw.  This material was later identified as homasote board (sound controlling board).  This appeared to be installed under all of the ceiling drywall in the kitchen, likely to reduce noise from the air handler in the attic.  They expressed that maybe they didn't have the right cut out tools.  After all the hurdles for the day, he replaced 1-2 switches with paddle switches and called it a day stating they would have to get some different tools for cutting the holes and do some brain storming.  \n\nJune 10th, Day - 2 (3 hours total)\n\nThe Electrician and help arrive on the scheduled time.  The first 1-2 hours of the morning was spent attempting to drill out more cut outs from the kitchen with little to no effect.  The idea of drilling down from the attic to make these recessed hole cut outs came up but was later stalled because in my attic I have decking or plywood down so you don't have easy access to the joist bays as well as duct work from the HVAC that runs all through my attic floor over key areas that would need recessed lighting or wiring installed.  The electrician spent another hour drawing/sketching which boards and ducts he would need access to underneath and stated that he/helper didn't have the tools to remove the decking to gain access to the joist space. I stated that it was the middle of the work day for me but as soon as I have time I will go into the attic and start pulling nails and cutting through plywood in the 100+ degree attic to help them gain access since I had a hammer and a nail puller tool.  Since the kitchen lighting was delayed again, he and the helper replaced the 3 existing pot lights with 3 newer LED recessed lights in the living room.  He wired them and call it a day around 1pm stating that until the decking in the attic was removed there wasn't much more they could do for the day and that the \"Boss/wife\" told him to go on another job for the rest of the day since they were at a stopping point here.  Before leaving I expressed that since the decking/ducts were posing such a challenge that we may have to postpone some of the work that we originally requested until the ducting is removed so that we weren't requesting any work that was too unreasonable or unrealistic/expensive. (We have a future project scheduled to replace the HVAC with ductless mini splits.)  \n\nThat night, we get an email and a call from the \"Boss/wife\" giving us a bill for the work done so far and explains some of the challenges that the Electrician was facing and why things weren't moving along as expected.  The bill was for $1470.00 thus far to include time elapsed and materials.  I had expressed concern that we were getting billed at a rate that was not following the progress/timeline.  When I was asked to explain I stated that given the challenges and expressed concerns/limitation of the Electrician and what we think we will have to remove from the list currently the only work that has been done was 4 cut holes in my kitchen ceiling with no lighting in them, 3 pot lights replaced with LEDs and 2 light switches replaced with paddles totaling $1470.00.  I continued that they were certainly owed half of the original estimate in an effort to show good faith on our end and that I do believe work was done and should be compensated but maybe not at the original cost/ day rate projected since there seems to be a level of resistance to work on these tougher jobs.  I stated there were a lot of hours clocked but not a lot to show for it in truth.  She repeated that they were billing for 5 hours each day so far even though I had logged maybe 4 hours the first day and barely 3 hours the second to which she rebutted that they charge for travel time and that he calls her when he arrives and leaves. Needless to say the conversation didn't get us anywhere and we wrote the the check for the $1470.00 to show that we were being honest and genuine.\n\nJune 10th, Day - 3 (5-6 hours total)\n\nAfter spending 3-4 hours of my own time the day prior in the hot attic pulling 4 inch nails and using my circular saw to make a series of access points for the recessed lighting in the kitchen the Electrician and helper arrive on time and hit the ground running.  They spend a majority of the day, 5-6 hours in the kitchen/attic cutting the rest of the recessed lighting holes, running wiring and installing dimmer switches.  After a full day of working in the intense heat they called it a day and justifiably so given the temperature.  The lighting in the kitchen looked amazing and we gave them much praise for their efforts.  Before leaving we talked to him about what work we felt logically made sense to postpone due to the decking/duct work getting in the way of completing the tasks.  We noted the following as tasks that would be completed at a later time and removed from the current tasking:\n\nDen\n\n • add 2 recessed lights and convert switch to a dimmer\n\nOffice\n\n • add 1 of recessed lights on new dimmer switch\n\n • add 1 light to closet\n\nKitchen\n\n • add new switch to existing lighting to be controlled from a 3rd access point\n\nLiving Room\n\n  • add 2 recessed lights to existing lighting/switching\n\n • add 1 recessed light with independent switch\n\n • run a C wire for a thermostat\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJune 14th, Day - 4 (4-5 hours total)\n\nThe Electrician arrived a half hour after the scheduled time, we discussed his plan of attack on the remaining list and he began working in the office.  He identified that decking and ductwork were blocking the location for the closet light and one of the recessed lights.  We asked if he could just install one of the two recessed lights and add the second one on later to switch he said sure no problem (thumbs up.)  After an hour or two or trying to snake a wire for the switch that would control the recessed light, he identified a crossed member in the wall preventing him from snaking the wire all the way through.  He stated he would need a longer drill bit that he didn't have at the moment and would have to postpone that work.  He continued with fixing a broken outlet in the office, expanded an outlet in the living room from 2 plug to 4 plug, installed the circuit breaker panel cover and finished swapping out all the remaining light switches with paddle switches.  He then stated to my wife that he was frustrated and done for the day.  We received a call later that day by the Boss stating that he left because he did all he could for the day and was frustrated with all of the challenges due to the decking and duct work.  We stated that were was still stuff on the list that he said he could complete but had not done yet.  She replied stating that if we wanted him to he could come back out maybe sometime later in the week if we really wanted those things done.\n\nSo that brings us to today, and email received for the remaining balance due of $825.00 after our initial deposit bringing the final total to $2295.00 stating that now the electrician knows the house somewhat we can get a price from him for the remainder of the work later down the road when the ducting gets removed.\n\nI asked and expected to pay for 16 tasks to be completed, identified hurdles along the way, removed 7 of the items on our list, and in the end still did not get the remaining work completed. From an overall view point, only 6 out of the original 16 items on the list were done and I'm being asked to pay more than was originally quoted.  \n\nMy thoughts are that this whole thing has devolved into a shit show and given the facts, we were originally quoted for $2250.00 to do 16 tasks.  I have experience as a handyman and do understand that costs, prices and timelines have to sometimes be fluid and I think hard work deserves fair compensation but in this situation I can't help but feel like I'm being billed for time spent on something that ultimately wasn't completed.  \n\nPlease share with me your thoughts and feelings on the situation and thank you for taking the time to read this.  Hopefully I didn't have too many spelling or grammar mistakes.",

          "body": "I read through it all, including the comments.\n\nA few things jump out here,\n\n (1) This is an existing account for the electrical contractor (small shop) and have done work for you at this house periodically over several years. They should have some memory of it, or notes/photos on file to recall things when a new existing-customer engagement is initiated. \n\n(2) Electrician is supposedly a master and further along in years, and therefore should have some wisdom about assessing a job, whether it was a pre-bid walkthrough or a Day-1 pre-work walkthrough, to get some idea that the attic was going to be a challenge, such that tasks could be organized/sequenced based on what was realistically doable on day 1 with the tools/supplies on-hand.\n\n(3) The key phrase here is *estimated at 3 days labor and $2250 including material*. \n\n>to do the following work on my home estimated at 3 days labor and $2250.00 including material. They stated they would bill on their day rate and did no pre inspection before quoting the work. We insisted that they take a look around the house/attic/basement to make sure they knew what to anticipate but they declined.  \nThey stated they would bill on their day rate ...  \n\n\nWhat that translates to is that this is **not an FFP contract**. It was an **estimate** and a **T&M type customer engagement**. It was neither a fixed-priced commitment overall or an itemized pricing commitment. Based on this being a T&M contract, they are correct for billing for the time utilized on this project.\n\n(4) Here's my assessment based on your descriptions:\n\n**Day 1:** **Valid time charged.** Adding recessed lighting to a room requires time to take measurements, figure the layout, cut hopes, etc. It does take a decent amount of time.  I'm going to give the electrician a partial pass on the kitchen ceiling. Encountering a hard difficult-to-penetrate atypical building material for the application that would not have been revealed if they had looked in the attic and seen plywood, and assumed that they could simply use other common techniques to fish the wires between joist bays from below.... I said partial pass, because after the second hole and the teeth on the holesaw likely being worn down, and 6 more holes to go in that room, they should have stopped there and retooled or moved on to another task that they could make progress on and get different tools for the next day for the material encountered.\n\n**Day 2: Time spent on living room valid. Undecided about time spend on kitchen.** I don't see what drilling down from above would have accomplished any differently than from bottom-up on that ceiling for the purpose for recessed lights. I'll allow for some time to go up and explore the attic, and figure out the reality of that, it was necessary time spent. *If removing plywood in the attic is actually what enabled the task to be completed, then the time spent figuring which joist bays needed to be opened up (etc) was appropriate.*\n\n**Day 3: Valid time charged.** This time is what would have been typical for the task, had the logistics been easy rather than difficult.\n\n**Day 4: Partial, most of time valid.**  No excuse for not having the long flexible drill bits on the truck when dispatching to a residential job that is predominantly all old-work type retrofit tasks. The rest of the work completed is appropriate.\n\n*Obviously you were expecting a project to go relatively according to plan, as did the electrician. Where the conflict began is lack of a walk-through at the pre-bid stage of the process which you requested and if you do have experience as a handyman, this should have been a red flag for a project with so many tasks that are spread-out throughout the structure.. Continuing forward with this project with that lack of due diligence left both you and the contractor vulnerable to having a higher than expected burn rate on hours relative to the tasks completed.*\n\nSupposedly this guy has more experience that I do .... but the missteps here are not having sized up the job on their side, and you not having insisted on the walk-through inclusive of the attic before they started work.\n\nLets look at this from another angle, what if the walk-through had been performed at the beginning of Day 1. What differences would that have yielded? Probably some reality that project task scheduling would need revision to address plywood removal, and faster decision making when access constraints were encountered. The burn rate of hours would still have been similar, it wouldn't have saved from the kitchen ceiling layered material, or the lack of a long flex bit on the truck, etc.\n\nLets look at this from a third view, what if the walk-through has been performed pre-bid. I think you would have been presented with a different estimate, regardless of how it was structured. Not sure how much different it would have been, or if it would still have been an under-estimate or not. The bottom line would be that there would have been less surprises in terms of results. That would be the difference. You'd still have a PITA kitchen ceiling that would have taken two working days to complete the 8 lights and switch.\n\nSome structures are just very difficult to work with. This is obviously one of them. It either costs tons of labor, or embracing projects in a larger fashion such as demo of ceilings/walls to overcome them. Working on older structures from the 50s and on back does present some challenges related to materials and designs, with either outdated ways of things or very hardi materials. Most stuff from the 60s forward is relatively straight-forward up through the early 2000s. The newest houses with spray-foam and other highly engineered crap are another animal.",

This is to rule out keyless sockets being installed and reduce the danger of a box or hanger breaking the lamp and causing a fire. Inexplicably, the rule was also applied to LED lamps and fixtures, but not to fluorescent lamps. In many jurisdictions, exposed compact fluorescent lamps were allowed, provided they used a GU24 base lamp. GU24-to-medium base socket adapters quickly became available because many consumers were irritated at spending double the price for a replacement lamp, which quickly led to the demise of the GU24 base. You still see a lot of GU24 lamps in residential construction from the 90s and mid-2000s, but with the rapid decline of incandescent lamp availability, they're almost non-existent in new construction today.\n\nThe counter argument to anyone claiming a lamp could be switched out to an incandescent today is a simple lack of availability of incandescent lamps. The only place you find (formerly) common sizes today is surplus or thrift stores, and the occasional clearance sale.",

LEDs are here to stay. There is absolutely no reason for further widespread use of incandescent lamps. LEDs have drawbacks, especially when it comes to color rendition, but that is quickly becoming a thing of the past. Just a decade ago, we only had LEDs that could produce a single wavelength (or a  group of a few specific wavelengths) of light. These days, phosphors that produce dozens or hundreds of wavelengths of light are commonplace and inexpensive to manufacturer. They are easily excited by a single ultraviolet emitter, and that's how most white LEDs today work. They're actually more closely related to fluorescent lamps then early LEDs.\n\nI'm 100% with you on your last statement - definitely ask your AHJ. When all is said and done, he or she is still the person you're going to have to get to sign the final inspection, and sometimes it's a lot easier to comply with their quirks than it is to comply with the NEC.",

I am a little worried that with a retro fit can, that the weight of it will cause the soffit to sag...\n\nits for incandescent lights Par30/40 bulbs so LED Wafer pot lights are not an option.\n\nAny advice or tips would be much appreciated.

      "selftext": "So i have a question that i require some expert input on before i go killing myself....the situation as it stands is thus, i would like to add a smart light switch in my kitchen but there are a number of challenges...\n\n1. i only have 1 leg ((it's an apartment building that was built in 1952...i think it was 40 or 50 years ago it was re-wired to add dedicated outlets/breakers by the windows for AC's and to switch from fuses to breakers))\n2. it's a 2 pole 1 gang box\n3. it's old work, so it's a little smaller than a newer box\n\nas i'm sure you're all aware, most smart switches need both legs to work, there are some that claim they don't but when i tried one, it didn't do anything. that brings us to now, i was watching a youtube video the other day and the presenter happened to mention that while not recommended, you could technically use the ground as a neutral leg of a circuit. All of my boxes are metal and grounded at the main, so any receptacle i install gets grounded by default.   \n\n\nThat got me thinking, could install a smart switch and run neutral to ground/the box itself? it would only be the electronics in the switch itself, not the lights, so basically nothing as far as draw goes, and the only things on that 15 AMP breaker are the 2 lights in the kitchen (2 fixtures, one with 2-'60w'LED bulbs and the other with 2 '100w' LEDs) and a single outlet in my room which feeds my nightstand (a clock and a USB charger for my phone and smart watch, all of which are run through a surge protector)\n\nwhich brings us back to the ultimate question...how dangerous would such a set up be? and yes, i'm aware that any short to ground would then energize the neutral of the switch with 110v, but i would imagine that would trip the breaker at the same time, no?",

      "selftext": "Single family home, built 1989, Washington state.\n\nBought our house recently, been poking around the electrical system, mostly replacing broken/worn out (and backstabbed!) outlets and switches, and installing smart switches. Haven't found anything particularly egregious yet (nothing that was about to cause a fire).\n\nI've noticed a few things in the process, and want y'all's opinions on whether I should do anything about them.\n\n1. About 15 of my normal 120v (outlet/lighting) circuits are wired with 14awg, but with 20A breakers. That's certainly not to current code, dunno whether it was legal in 1989. Should I replace with 15A breakers? The lights in the house are 95% LED, so I'm not particularly worried about nuisance trips (I measured _total_ consumption on the house with every light turned on at about 11 amps per phase (~2600W total))\n\n2. There are a handful of MWBCs (mostly things like lights + outlets in the same room), but they're all on single breakers without handle ties. Worth adding handle ties, and swapping breakers as necessary so they're adjacent?\n\n3. If I'm already in there replacing breakers, is it worth retrofitting any with GFCI/AFCI/combo breakers? AFAIK all of the \"normal\" circuits that need GFCI (outdoors, garage, bathrooms, kitchen, etc) have it via regular GFCI outlets. Question 3B is what to do about GFCI/AFCI on an MWBC - as far as I can tell, two pole GFCI breakers _do not exist_ for my CH panel.\n\n4. Anything else age-related I should look for at this point? All the wiring looks to be in pretty good shape, and I'll eventually be inside all the wall boxes as I replace switches and get rid of back stabs.",

He says that this is a global issue, and not a localized issue to one single branch of the wiring.\n\nIn addition, when we turned on our electric washer/dryer, he was able to measure a very large drop in voltage coming through the breaker, which he said shouldn't be happening if PG&E has a secure connection to the house.\n\nHe mentioned that there's 2 schools of thought in this trouble shooting -\n\n1. It's a PGE issue of delivery coming into the house (the connection at the pole may be loose, as he noticed that the lights flickered a bit more when there was wind moving the line)\n2. It could be that while the power coming into the breaker is ok, there may be a loose connection somewhere between the breaker and the rest of the daisy chain of the home, causing all lights to flicker from that spot onwards.\n\nI've called PG&E to come out and place a monitoring device on the meter + check the pole to make sure that everything is connected properly - the wind + flickering might be a coincidence, but we want to rule that out before we go on a wild goose chase trying to narrow down the connection issue (if it exists) in the house.\n\nHi r/electricians \\- I hope you're doing well and staying safe.\n\nHave a question about flickering lights in my newly renovated home.\n\nWe recently renovated our home and had our entire house gutted, and redid all the wiring/breaker box, electrical lines, etc., into the house. PG&E came out as well and replaced the 2 wires coming from the pole into our home as well as they were corroded.\n\nWe're using a Siemens panel and Siemens residential circuit breakers.\n\nWith that being said, we're getting issues of our recessed lights flickering (sometimes like crazy, sometimes subtle). Each time PGE comes out, they turn off the power and then turn it back on, check the permanent hook ups, and check our meter. When they turn the power back on, the flickering goes away for about a day or so, and then comes back. If it helps, we're using Lutron switches that are all LED rated, and the lights that flicker are not on dimmers either.\n\nTonight, we had a circuit breaker pop, and the recessed lights upstairs all went out. Appliances and other 220V appliances all stayed on with no issues, while the recessed lights all went out. When I reset the breaker, I can see the Siemens LED indicate that there's an ARC Fault, but the LED light goes out after 5 seconds, so don't know if it's a true arc fault (or what that really even means)\n\nPGE is now telling us that they have done everything on their end to deliver constant power to our home without voltage spikes, and that the problem may lie on our end.\n\nI've done some research online (but i'm 10000% no expert on electrical stuff at all), and see that flickering lights and popped breakers could be a symptom of an overloaded circuit. The funny thing is that we actually don't have anything plugged into our outlets except for 2 phone chargers and a Christmas tree light - since we just literally moved in 2 weeks ago.\n\nCould this be that our contractor/electrician have overloaded one of the circuits with drawing too much power from our LED recessed lights? (this doesn't sound right to me?) or did they do some shoddy wiring into the breaker panel that is causing this issue?\n\nHappy to provide any additional information, and really hoping someone can help chime in here! Thanks in advance for the help!",

A overload does not always mean that the circuit is overloaded by the amount of stuff on it.It can also overload and trip the breaker as the loose connection is causing it to draw more amps than the breaker can safely supply.

Problem: The 1st light was on in receptacle #1, when I plugged in the light into the #2 receptacle, 2nd light flashed on for a split second, then both lights went out (top and bottom receptacles had 1 light each).\n8. I tried to reset the circuit breaker (didn't look like anything tripped) when I reset it, all the other lights part of this breaker turn on, but this one outlet is still dead. (I tried to turn on and off the switch on the wall too)\n9. Do I just replace this outlet? Can this outlet have both sockets used? Can I only chain up 1 light consecutively and not use the 2nd receptacle? Am I shorting something with the wiring when I first began?\n10. Let me know if you need more specifics.",

It was basically 3 wires. Bare for ground, White on the silver, and hot on the brass. It was fine until that 2nd light was plugged in and that killed both lights.\n\nAnd thanks by the way, I'm not trying to be rude or anything, just trying to understand how I'm not blowing power to the rest of the circuit, just this outlet... and if I buy a new outlet is it going to die again? Can I buy a 20 amp instead of 15 amp? Is 15 amp enough? Or just faulty wiring?\n\nEdit: Wow I literally popped off the outlet and the hot wire was broken, like disconnected from the wire.

      "selftext": "Just bought my first house. I'm a novice in electrical work but not completely inexperienced. I can wire a receptacle or a switch (at least a single-pole switch--don't think I've wired any three way switches, but I feel comfortable I could figure it out).\n\nThe house electrical is having some quirks and I'm trying to discern if there's a significant problem and what that problem might be. House is in Nevada and built in 2003. Here are the clues:\n\n1. We've burned through light bulbs surprisingly quickly. In the first six months of owning the house, we replaced probably about a dozen. One of those was a replacement LED bulb, but that was in a bathroom and the globe of the fixture was removed for a bit, so not positive that's related.\n2. Appliances kicking on or changing cycles frequently causes lights to flicker. I feel like this is a common thing, but I've heard that modern residential electric isn't really supposed to have this issue anymore if everything is done properly.\n3. Some lights, particularly the kitchen lights (we replaced with LED bulbs, has a dimmer switch), have a noticeable delay before turning on. Like sometimes a solid three or four seconds after flipping the switch.\n4. I replaced a switch with one of those rockers that has an LED that comes on when the switch is off. As soon as I turned the power to it back on, the LED was flickering quite a bit. I triple-checked my connections but ultimately put the old switch back.\n5. Maybe unrelated but with everything else figured I should ask--a few of the rocker switches seem to have deformed over time (pics below). Normally I'd think this was an age/wear thing, but with everything else I started to wonder if sometimes the boxes might be getting too warm.\n\nSome previous owner seems to have done some of their own DIY electrical work, but it all seems to work.\n\nMy first guess is that since these issues seem to be spanning multiple circuits maybe I should be looking around the breaker box, but I was hoping to get some advice here on how I could maybe try to diagnose this a bit more methodically/correctly. I've got some basics like a plug tester and a multimeter.\n\nThanks for any help!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Dirty, I know. I'm embarrassed on the internet.](https://preview.redd.it/tk1acutk8st81.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=978ec373abd420588308fbd5e6c80427c47f56a5)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rpl41utk8st81.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2d31fe53fca9f5867b5f53bc12acab5ccdad49bd",

Some are better than others.\n\nLastly, - the rocker switch with the light inside it.\nIf your light switch doesn't have a white/neutral wire\nconnected to it, then it is \"stealing power\" for the light,\nby passing a small current through the light bulbs\nthat the switch is controlling.\n\nThis works well with incandescent lamps, because the\ncurrent flow is so small, the filaments won't glow.\n\nWhen used with LEDs and Fluorescents, this can cause all kinds\nof weird behavior, both from the little light in the switch,\nas well as your overhead lights.\n\nI've been in multiple hotels that have those switches in the guest rooms.\nBut they installed Fluorescent light bulbs in the lamps/ceiling fixtures.\n\nSo, when I went to sleep, the tiny current flowing through the circuit\nwas enough to build up a charge in the fluorescent, and, every few minutes,\nit would just flash, like a camera.

Could be that for some unknown reason, these lamps are connected to a fixture with a magnetic ballast and they don't like to be dimmed... \"magnetic-low voltage\"\n\nLong story short, he basically told me that when they recommend a 120V line voltage dimmer for an LED application, it doesn't always necessarily mean that it will work properly when dimmed. It means that it will probably work, but won't catch fire.  No joke that was the gist of it.  Recommended = Safe    ...    Not 100% fully functional .\n\nThey might say something like dimming ability down to 20% and below that its not guaranteed.\n\nFrom all of the research and installations that I've done, your best bet is working with products that offer a dedicated 0-10V DC driver for dimming control right from the start.\n\nOr just tell the customer that your warranty is only valid as long as they can read your rear bumper license plate or as long as they can see your headlights.  :)\n\nGood luck!",

      "selftext": "Guys, I don’t have a lot of experience with residential HVAC systems and I recently bought and moved into my new house with a high efficiency system. It has an electronic air filter which has metal plates which filter the air. It has a standard metal mesh pre filter. It’s cleanable and reusable which I like, but I noticed the previous home owner had it turned off. I turned it on, and when the furnace cycled, I heard this loud discharging crackling on every vent in the house and coming from the furnace filter. It was very loud and sounded detrimental so I turned off the filter system and it didn’t come back.\n\nI pulled the filter and checked and it had some light dust but no large dust bunnies or anything. \n\nI’m an industrial electrical maintenance lead, and to me it seems like the energized plates are creating an excessive static buildup that is discharging through the house vent system. Is anyone familiar with these systems able to recommend things to check? When turned on, the input power and system LEDs do not illuminate, I’m fearing improper installation and wiring and am trying to find an installation manual to check against. Thank you!\n\nTLDR; My high efficiency HVAC with electronic filter buzzes all the vents with a crackling electrical sound and I don’t know why and has no power LEDs illuminated.",

I have a chicken coop that I am using a misting system with, and this would be a component of the setup.  Anyway, during research I learned about NO and NC for relays. Using that as my next avenue of searching, I came across this:\n\nDPST 1NO 1NC 8Amp Power Relay Module, AC 110V 115V 120V Control Voltage https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089QCG6GK/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_fabc_AMV44Q1QQ5PSGFY6DBC6\n\nSo if I have a setup like this (pretend the light bulb is the sprinkler valve)...\n\nhttp://waterheatertimer.org/images/K4236C-photo-control-450.jpg\n\n...how can I integrate the above NONC module to turn on the light (or, in my case, the power to the inline sprinkler valve) during the day?  From what I can tell, assuming the photocell would turn the LED OFF during the DAY, I'd be using SW2 to connect to the valve, but I'm not sure how to wire this relay.\n\nOr, am I totally off base here?\n\nAgain, my intent is to have an online sprinkler valve have power during daylight hours, and no power during the night, using a photocell as the primary determining factor.  Yes, I know I could use a timer and just shut off the hose at night, but I'd prefer to not use a timer, since daylight hours change throughout the year.  Plus, this is more of a challenge.\n\nThanks!",

I have uploaded an image of how I am planning on this working:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/4zQZO4B\n\nI got the idea for this from here:\n\nhttps://www.backyardchickens.com/articles/keeping-your-chickens-cool-thermostat-activated-misting-system.66986/\n\nAnd for the photocell, I am thinking to get something like this:\n\nhttps://www.homedepot.com/p/TORK-120-Volt-LED-CFL-Post-Mount-Button-Photo-Control-2107A/207151788\n\nThe overall idea is that I will be able to set the temperature at which the sprinkler valve will turn on.  That way, if it's hot outside, the misters come on, and if it's not, they don't come on, or they shut off if they are already on.  Some comments have been made about if there is a failure in the system while the misters are on, they will stay on. I already thought of that and research indicates that the sprinkler valve is electromagnetic, and if the power is lost, the sprinkler valve closes, and the misting stops.  So that is not a concern.\n\nAnyway, as you can see in my drawing (which will probably make your electrician brain go crazy!), I imagine putting the reverse photo cell along the power line that goes from the thermostat to the sprinkler valve.  I suppose, really, it could go anywhere along the electrical pathway.\n\nSo I guess I have a couple questions.\n\nFirst, do you see any concerns with my current setup? Especially the wiring in the thermostat.  I interpreted the thermostat wiring based off the link in this post for backyardchickens.com.\n\nSecond, I am a code programming nerd, not an electrician nerd, so if this looks okay as it is, the only other thing that I really need is a drawing of some sort that shows how I could use the photocell with the NONC relay along an extension cord (as in my drawing intent).\n\nThat way, at night, even if the temperature is still hot outside, the missing system will not be running because the photocell interrupts the electricity flow.",

My teacher made a big deal about understanding power factor when determining load for your lighting; that if you just add all the wattage of your bulbs up you aren’t getting a true representation of the load on your circuit and you can potentially overload it. My understanding of it is that since no ballast is 100% efficient, you will have some additional load based on the inefficiency. Like if your ballast is 95% efficient then you have to account for an additional 5% load per fixture. Is that right? I bothered my teacher a bunch about it and he didn’t do a great job explaining it or I didn’t do a good job understanding him. \n\nMy co worker basically said not to worry about it since we are fast moving into the era of LED lighting and the chances that you will overload a circuit with LEDs in residential or light commercial work are slim to none. Just trying to get a better grasp of the math because I want to  be competent. Thanks for any insight",

          "body": "Let’s see if I can explain it. Power factor is unity, or in-phase, when you have a purely resistive load, like a heater. If you look at the waveforms of the voltage and current, they will be lined up or in-phase. \n\nHowever, if you add inductive loads (anything with a coil ie: motor, ballast), the voltage and current waveforms get out of phase, with the current lagging the voltage. This causes the same load to draw a higher amperage than if it was at unity. This is why you can’t just use the wattage of the bulbs as there is lost energy due to the reactive power of the circuit. The total apparent power of the circuit will be the bulb wattage divided by the power factor. \n\nCapacitors in an AC circuit have the opposite effect of inductors. They cause out of phase voltage and current, but with the current leading the voltage. Capacitors aren’t used in a circuit by themselves, but added to a building with a poor power factor, they cancel out the effect of the inductive loads and bring the power factor close to unity. \n\nPower factor correction is used most often to cancel the effect of large motor loads, not the size of coils used in lighting ballasts. \n\nThere’s more complexity to it than that, but this is a basic explanation.

Real power is the rate at which work is being done and heat loss. It's from energy you're not getting back. Apparent power is total rate of energy drawn. It's what you'd find if you measured voltage/current and it's what the circuit would appear to use. P = S in a purely resistive circuit so the power factor is 1. P won't always equal S when you start introducing inductors and capacitors. This is because energy is being stored in the magnetic field of the inductor and electric field of the capacitor. These fields don't actually do work. So energy won't be consumed and it's not counted in P. This energy is called reactive power (Q) since inductors and capacitors react to the frequency of the circuit. The vector sum P + Q = S. You'll understand this once you see phasors.  So the more Q in the circuit the farther P gets from S and your power factor goes down. You still need to supply energy for these fields being represented by Q. So you have to design the circuits for S not just P. That's where the overload comes from. Just expecting P but in reality the circuit demanded is S.",

      "selftext": "What do you think will change over the next couple of decades? I feel like lighting will or should eventually go to DC power. LEDs take low voltage DC anyway, why convert it at the point of use, when you could have one converter for the whole house? Need a new light, just poke a hole and stick it to the drywall. Other than that, I'm not really sure. I don't follow the smart home stuff, so I don't even know what they're doing currently. Will light switches have digital data cables to them, or just be wireless and you can stick them anywhere?   \nThe reason I ask is that I'm designing wiring for my house right now, and I plan to live here a long time. I'm thinking of running conduit down to the light switches (empty attic above) just so I can put in whatever wires the future might require. Plugs won't ever change, even though in a perfect world they would all be twist lock. Maybe DC plugs would be added, but the electronics you plug in use too many different DC voltages, so that probably wouldn't work out.",

AC isn't going anywhere due to the fact that DC is hard to transmit over long distances. This battle was fought when things were first electrified in the late 19th/early 20th century. More history here: https://www.energy.gov/articles/war-currents-ac-vs-dc-power\n\n Just plan to run conduit and normal cabling, as you can transmit DC over romex if you so desire. The other thing to consider about DC though, is the amount of current you need to get the same power (watts). At 12VDC to power 20W you need nearly 2A of current, while at 120VAC (or 120VDC for that matter) you just need just .2A. To extrapolate that, a 1500W microwave would consume 125A @ 12V, which would require quite a thick cable if it was any kind of distance from the source. Yes, it could be stepped up to 120VDC, and only consume 12.5A but there wouldn't be a practical reason to do so.",

The luminaires are from Amazon ($40 ea), IP67 rated, with a knuckle. They are replacing 10W, 12V floods that died. I'm debating whether to keep these (because they're so cheap), and supplement the extra material cost of FS J-boxes to mount the knuckles, 120V photocell, SJ cabling, and ground spikes.\n\nThere's existing 12V cable that's photocell controlled already in place. I would prefer to use 12V luminaires, but can't find them for less than $150 ea. So, all of this basically comes down to price.

Bit of HVAC possibly or banks of radiant heaters and that kinda stuff?\n\nOr do you guys dabble aswell AS the lighting technician, rigging the lighting bars for shows, setting up DMX for special effects and LED spotlights, and maybe the radio links for backstage comms and programming the lighting scenes and chases that take shows from looking amature to professional.\n\nFilm guys, or any visual/performing arts, Art Gallery or museums and stuff, please!Let me know what your average week looks like!",

Very very rarely would you be dealing with facilities, ie HVAC, heaters, house lights, etc. maybe in an emergency situation.  Same with motors for cycs or drops, unless you’re working on an installation crew.  Newer Broadway theaters are amazing in the amount of electrical in the building itself. We’re talking thousands of dimmer channels, emergency backup lighting, control systems, automated rigging, etc. More of what your daily work in a theater would be is setting up and taking down temporary power distro, hanging lights, running audio and video cables, etc.  Touring theater and music acts have everything very specifically laid out and prepped before they even arrive at your venue, and it’s like assembling an erector set according to specific plans. Lots of “put this here, plug it into this”.  Corporate AV and special events is similar, but less prep beforehand. Bonkers amounts of low voltage video, audio, control, networking, even on smaller shows. Lots of heavy feeder cable usually tied into house power to supply large distro racks to go out to  equipment. Crazy amounts of twist lock cable. 99% of the time distros are taking in 3 phase with neutral and feeding single phase or 120v loads, the only 3 phase loads you will ever see are the chain hoists for rigging. Most convention centers have 480-208/120 transformers to step distribution power down at point of use. Sometimes you’re running off a generator. Sometimes two. Sometimes 12.  Film and TV is all about temporary power or putting up and taking down lights. Miles and miles of feeder, usually 4/0 or 2/0 SC or type W. Miles and miles of Bates cable(100A 120V) from Doghouses(1200A cam to Bates distros) to Lunchboxes(5x20A boxes) for plugging in everything on set, or to RatPac portable dimmers.  Redundancy and over-building is the standard. No popped circuits or kicked out plugs to slow production down. Ever. So many lights of every different shape and size, and the specialized dimming and control systems for them.  DMX, ArtNet, gigabit network systems, wireless networking, are all electricians’ responsibilities on set.  Entertainment electrical is a very fascinating and fast paced career.  It’s usually pretty fun, and if you join an IATSE union, very well paid also.   Feel free to ask me questions.",

      "selftext": "Back story....\n\nPicked up a home near TX coast about a yr or so ago built in 84. Seemed pretty typical for what you'd expect electrically for it's age/location, including an item or 2 of poor previous work. As such, everything is pretty much standard for the time such as no AFCI/GFCI, 2 wire (plus ground) on the 240's vs 3, no tamper resistant outlets, etc. Except for pointing out the above type stuff that doesn't meet current code, the home inspector gave the electrical system a clean bill of health except pointing out an odd way the panel was wired. The grounds on a good number of the circuits are twisted together where they enter the panel to the lugs (2 'bundles'/lugs of 5 or 6 grounds each). Each is a nice tight consistent looking twist and appear to be original if not at least been that way for a very long time, so he saw no issue with that functionally (nor did I), but did point out it being unusual (and I never had seen one done like that). Everything else was fine, each N and G in their own holes on the bus bar etc. I still question if that's even legit (I think probably not), but it's an outdoor 150a panel showing it's age so replacing it and upgrading to 200 is something I want to do eventually anyways. After closing on the house, checked the electrical more thoroughly during fixture changes and every other connection just because. I'm not a residential electrician, but am an aircraft mechanic so I do know full well the importance of proper connections, resistance and such, and all that fun stuff. In fact that led to new fixtures and all in nearly the entire house. Switches and outlets were all back stabbed with many connections having not been landed right to begin with or else worked themselves out a bit over the years, metal boxes not properly grounded, stuff like that...so between changing the fans and lights I wanted and replacing all the switches and outlets with better ones, all that stuff is new...so everything inside is properly wired and grounded and good with multimeter. \n\nCurrent situation....\n\nGround rod got bumped into by mower wheel which happens now and then. It's up a few inches from the ground 4 or 5 inches from slab as is typical around here. Immediately following that, lights and such would randomly have minor dim/flickers...much like a heavy load starting up like hvac would do, but with no heavy load starting up even at neighboring houses much less mine. Remembering I bumped the ground rod mowing, that's the first thing I went and looked at. I noticed the acorn nut was not very tight. Not fall apart loose, but you could move it without a whole lot of effort. OK, simple enough, retorque it. Got out the torque wrench and quickly realized as soon as I started turning it that the acorn was cracked, which is prob why it wasnt tight to begin with! Anyhow replaced that and all went back well again, so I'm pretty sure that was the cause...but that makes me question SHOULD that be the cause?!? Seems to me something isnt right. For plumbing, PVC comes from the street to a stub out on exterior wall, then copper or whatever from there in this area, so electric isnt typically grounded to plumbing. It's pretty much just the return to the transformer and ground electrode(s). In this case, would a poor ground rod connection cause that much of a difference? Seems to me the return to the transformer should be doing the heavy lifting with the ground rod being secondary having little to no effect during normal conditions (like no lightning/surges/other significant instabilities). From the transformer, the triplex comes down to smaller pole and splits off to my weather head on one side and neighbors on the other. Neighbor has no issues, but neither did I till I apparently knocked the ground connection to the rod a bit loose with the mower and none since fixing  it. Does this sound normal or is there likely still a problem somewhere?",

Def not game for messing with it further. Guess I'll get the power co to check their end, and if nothing found there, call the sparkys and prob just get the entire panel changed like I was intending to eventually do as well as the wire between the meter and it (which likely would be done anyways with the upgrade) if it's not a quick fix.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks guys!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh and last thing....have you ever seen or heard about grounds being twisted/bundled together and placed in larger lugs as described above vs 1 or 2 per hole in the bus bar as usual?

      "selftext": "Hi! New to the group. Confident working with most electrical problems - not sure I use the right terminology, so please forgive and correct me!\n\nI have replaced older recessed lighting cans in my kitchen with snap-in retrofit 6\" LED lights. I have NOT used the \"screw in\" socket connectors for the LED lights, but rather, have removed the can completely and wired the LED lights directly to the wires that had been leading from the junction box to the can. These cans were older models where the can itself was connected to a larger junction box containing the connections and a thermal protector. One of the LED lights is now going on and off occasionally and I'm hearing what I believe is the tell-tale click (well kind of a click - it's somewhere between a \"click\" and a \"ping\") of the thermal protector. The LED light doesn't generate much heat so I'm betting that it's a bad thermal protector (the house is 30+ years old). I know it's not the LED light itself, as I tried a different one and the same problem occurs.\n\nQuestion - do I need to replace the thermal protector or, since I'm using the LED lights now, can I bypass it completely?\n\nThanks for all advice!",

Couldn't find any information, but they are IC-Rated.\n\nFrom quick internet search:  \n\"In IC-rated lighting system design, the IC-rating stands for “Insulation Contact,” meaning that IC-rated recessed lighting can safely come into contact with insulation without causing a fire hazard. This makes IC-rated light fixtures essential for spaces like an attic space or insulated ceiling where a lack of heat dissipation can be a concern.\"\n\nSeems there are certain conditions where thermal protectors are required.  If you have some installed it's likely needed to be up to code if a non-IC rated fixture is used.  For IC-Rated fixture, it seems like it's not required.\n\nFrom what I've read it has to do with fire hazard of which insulation material or other high risk material is near the fixture.  Need to read up on what conditions are needed to allow non-IC rated fixtures without thermal protector.",

That's what I think as well but it is a \"retro-fit\" - meaning it's designed to be plugged into (either via a screw in adapter or a plastic connector) to the existing fixture - so does that mean it assumes that you've got a thermal protector on the original fixture?\n\nFor reference, this is the retrofit LED I'm using:\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073HHBXMJ/ref=ppx\\_yo\\_dt\\_b\\_asin\\_title\\_o08\\_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073HHBXMJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)",

As I thought about it more I realized that 15 amps for a light circuit is absurd in modern times. Barring the absurdly large lights, basically no single light is more than about 40 watts (assuming that you're using CFL/FL/LED, etc...). Assuming a you only wanted a max 80% load on a circuit that would still give you 36 40 watt lights on a single light circuit. I realize that the standards are written based off how things used to be, and I know a bunch of crappy electricians will try to run as much on one circuit as possible, but I really wish they allowed for 10 amp circuits as long as they were dedicated to a single room. It would be nice to run smaller wire and cheaper too.\n\nShould point out that this obviously only applies to residential, I realize in commercial/industrial a lot of things change.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?",

Best bet is to look for a GU10 retrofit rather than jank something together, burn down the house, and get shafted by the insurance company.  If it were 12V, the retrofits wouldn't work because they're made for 120.  I noticed that the lights in the link are marked as 0-10V dimming.  You probably don't want that, that requires a low-voltage dimming circuit from the switch to all the lights, separate from the power circuit.  You probably want something that just says \"dimmable,\" although stuff with better documentation may indicate triac or ELV dimming.\n\nI've never found any retrofits that look like slimlines - they all do the recessed thing.  Not a huge fan, but they don't look that bad once they're up.  I have put wafers in place of old pots before, but it's quite a hassle.  You need to remove the can to get at the junction box.  If they're old IC rated cans, you also need to smash the outer box out from the inside to get at the wires to rip them out and move them to the new junction box.  This part can be pretty violent.  If you luck out and there's no outer box, you can snap the wafer into the old housing without smashing it out, provided that the hole is the right size.  All of this while reaching through a 4 inch hole, without leaving a mark on the ceiling.  It's not something I would recommend as a DIY project.",

Admittedly, I appreciate the commercial experience I was offered, considering I couldn't even bend an offset in a conduit before.  Looking at it, I think I'd rather challenge myself to find work in a more rewarding atmosphere, rather than move up the ranks in a field I don't much care for.  The company's management and expense priorities seem a bit hectic, unpredictable, and poorly balanced; creating trickle-down headaches that stretch loyalty thin\n\nI was hoping to get a few questions out, and maybe some suggestions thrown at me:\n\n1. \"Go Union!\" ....W-Where to start?  I don't quite know the benefits to being accepted into the brotherhood, and am I able to find non-union work if I need to eat? \n\n2. \"Industrial\"  The word intimidates me, but so did commercial for a long time.  Has anyone made this jump recently, and what is to be expected?\n\n3. I would love to expand my knowledge, and as necessary as it is, residential work seems like lego at this point (besides the \"fun\" of moving potlights over and over)  What would be the next reasonable step without falling into a day-in-out dead end?\n\nWith no confidence, I always find myself comfortable in a place for far too long, so I'm really hoping to visualize a change in the near future.

While most people pick up the ins and outs of roping a house relatively quickly, it doesn't mean you're choose to being \"done\" or \"finished\". There's more to it... Try hot checking behind a completely different crew or doing service work without cutting holes, if you still think you're the top of the pile, see if you can do some piece work, try running a crew and doing inspections all the way from the dirt work until the homeowner moves in. Once you get to that point, you might look at commercial in a different light. Five or ten years of commercial work and then industrial work won't intimidate you at all until you get to a power house. \n\nDepending on the number of years you have under your belt, you'd either start as first year, test in as 2nd or 3rd year, or get the requisite number of hours/years and organize in as a JW. You'll have to see which is closer to your number of hours and which is financially doable.

I can take pictures of whatever you need, but here is some more backstory:\n\n\nI have a split level home with a small recording studio in the finished basement. My 1st floor living room has 9 of the lights in a 3 x 3 with a dimmer on one end and toggle on the other pole (if that is the right terminology).\n\nThe basement/studio has three dimmer switches (all Lutron).\n\n- one controls a group of 4 for the main part of the room\n- one controls a group of 2 angled down-lights\n- one controls a group of 2 above my computer desk \n\nElectric guitars are highly susceptible to EMI, as they use magnets for pickups. I have property shielded and built in practice what the industry calls a faraday cage in the guitars via copper foil tape with conductive adhesive, even though it isn't a true faraday cage. It does greatly reduce RFI, however it has no affect on EMI.\n\n\nWhen the lights are on, I can't use the guitars at all as the harmonic buzz dominates the pickups. When turned off there remains a little residual interference which I assume is low voltage in the wire due to the capacitance in the lights built in transformers, but I am not an EE so I digress.\n\n\nI have hired several electricians without luck. Unfortunately it seems no one around my city is familiar with low voltage dimming.\n\nSince the lights rectify the current, could I use some form of small variable transformer? All I have found on mouser.com are $130+ industrial rotary variable transformers that would get super hot and should go in a wall. Besides, I don't think my wife would want it in her living room.\n\nThank you all!\n",

I’m finding some retrofit can/recess LEDs and my new ceiling fan/LED light kit flicker. I tested various dimmable retro kits til I found one that doesn’t flicker. The fan/light still flickers periodically. I got Legrand dimmers that supposedly work with LEDs. I am wondering if lack of grounding causes the flickering issue. I have no ground wires in the house, except for my shop where I’ve added it. My fan instructions specifically state to make sure the fixture is well-grounded to avoid LED light flicker. I was under the impression my conduit provided grounding, but not sure. Any insights from the pros here? Do I just need to pull a new grounding wire to the fan fixture to fix the flickering? TIA!",

      "selftext": "Hello:\n\nI am in the initial stages of planning out an off grid house and am interested in utilizing DC distribution for as much as possible to cut down on inverter losses. \n\nI apologize if this is a bad subreddit for this question, but it seemed that /r/AskElectronics would be even worse.\n\nI have been attempting to find a connector that I could use for removable DC interconnects for cord and plug connected equipment such as computers, lights and other such equipment. \n\nIdeally it would be a standard connector like the NEMA connectors either with different connectors for different voltages mentioned in the standard or several different variants that could be turned into an internal standard. I would also like either a live disconnection ability (which I know is more challenging with DC) or that has interlocking capabilities that do not allow it to be removed from or inserted into the outlet with a voltage applied. And finally I would like it to be a similar size to a NEMA 5-15 or L5-15 plug so I can utilize standard electrical boxes etc. User friendliness for non electricians and potential AHJ likability are also plusses. \n\nNow, this is not just a \"do my research for me\" type of question. I have identified three good options but none of them meet the requirements of interlocking and having the multiple configurations. \n\n- [XLR 4 Pin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLR_connector#Four-pin_\\(XLR4\\)): Commonly used in Professional AV equipment to supply ~12V DC to lighting, cameras and audio equipment. \n\n * **Advantages**: Very common connector for similar applicaitons. No problem finding connectors and panel mount jacks. has decent voltage and current ratings. Relatively inexpensive. Locking.\n\n * **Disadvantages**: Only one configuration and no interlocking. ( 3 and 5 pin XLR are out as they are much more commonly used for audio and lighting DMX control respectively.)\n\n- [M12 connectors - T coding](https://www.connectortips.com/coding-mean-m12-connectors/): Very common connector in industrial automation for connecting sensors and small motors. \n\n * **Advantages**: Standardized! Designed for industrial applications so very rugged. Locking. The T coding is specifically designed for supplying DC power. Small and could be easily mounted on wall plates. Voltage and current range are in the sweet spot. (max 60V DC, 12A)\n\n * **Disadvantages**: Only one configuration and no interlocking. The T coded connectors are just coming on to the market and are made by relatively few manufacturers.\n\n- [IEC 60309 - Pin and Sleeve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_60309): There exist two common DC variants of the pin and sleeve connectors: the 3h ground P+N+E for 50–250 V DC and the 8h ground P+N+E for >250 V DC. In theory, from my reading of the standard, you could utilize the various colors as well as undefined ground positions to make multiple configurations but no company that I have found sells more than these two configurations.\n\n * **Advantages**: Standardized! Designed for industrial applications so very rugged. Locking. Specifically designed for DC power distribution. Interlocking can be accomplished relatively easily with fused disconnect switches similar to those available for AC Pin and Sleeve configurations.\n\n * **Disadvantages**: These are designed for high voltage, high amperage applications and are very expensive and large. I have been able to find only one manufacturer that sells DC pin and sleeve connectors which is Hubbell but they have a [very limited selection - pdf warning](http://ecatalog.hubbell-wiring.com/press/pdfs/Original_WLDSP004.pdf) that starts out at 30A and goes up to 100A at 2 voltage ranges. \n\nSome example applications of where these connectors would be used. \n\n* connecting a rack mount server to a power distribution unit. This would be in place of a typical NEMA L5-20 or IEC connector. \n* connecting a (custom) LED floor lamp to a wall outlet. \n* typical device chargers or other small electronics with wallwart type AC - DC converters. \n* Other places cord and plug connected equipment would be used that has an integrated AC to DC converter with a max voltage of 60V at 12A. \n\nSorry for the long post but I wanted to show the research I had already done and thank you in advance.",

In these applications, the name of the game is efficiency, so your battery packs don't have to be as big, your solar panel field can be smaller, etc.\n\nWith regard to the current limiting, every device would have an inline fuse installed, along with fusing/circuit breakers in the distribution wiring. \n",

With a new fixture you may be eligible for rebates and they come with a 5 year warranty.  Be wary of off name brand LED fixtures and bulbs though the drivers leave a bit to be desired.  You can purchase new 4 bulb t8 fixtures lamped and whipped for around $49.00+/- (again possibly better on quote)  Or do as these gentlemen suggested and replace the ballast with T8 electronic ballast and bulbs material should run you <$20.00 labor depends on your electrician or the abilities of your maintenance department.  The only down side to the retrofit are using the existing tombstones.  More than likely they are fine but can cause problems if they have some age on them.  At least this is my advice from what I've experienced up here in north Georgia.  When looking at LED do yourself an ROI or return on investment sheet, the hard part is figuring how much you spend on maintenance and bulbs over a year on your existing set up compared to LED's maintenance free fixtures (or at least they should be).",

      "selftext": "My end goal is to have an electric point\\-of\\-use water heater in my garage.  The challenge is that I have a small garage, with a single 20 amp circuit for receptacles \\(with a separate circuit for some LED lighting\\).  I am already at the point where I can trip the breaker if I run my miter saw and shop vac at the same time; no surprise there.  I am trying to avoid having to install accommodations to use a gas point\\-of\\-use heater... So basically, I am curious to know if there is such a device \\(it might resemble a surge protector\\) that will plug into a 120v wall outlet, which will then allow another electrical device to be plugged into it, \\(i.e. water heater\\)  and monitor circuit current.  If current current changes/drops due to loads elsewhere on the circuit \\(power tools turned on\\) then this device would cut all outgoing power to said device \\(i.e. water heater\\).  It would then turn back on once current 'normalizes'.  Basically something that will cut power to a little water heater if it notices the load when I turn on other amp\\-hungry devices.  I suppose it might work like the opposite of a surge protector.   My understanding is that these heaters come on intermittently to heat the water, and they also seam to draw over 10 amps.  I don't want to have to struggle with this thing tripping the breaker all the time.  I don't have a  great understanding of electrical theory so I don't know if such a device is feasible.  Is there such a device?",

Somebody decided that the kitchen needed to be served by 5 different circuits, 90 amps in total (plus dedicated circuits for the stove and oven), while the whole master bedroom/bathroom makes do with a single 15 amp daisy chain.  All outlets be backstabbed.\n\nAnyways, I got around to putting a GFCI in the laundry room receptacle that also feeds the outdoor lighting and garage.  The moment I turn on the outdoor lighting, boom, trip.\n\n  There are 7 total light sockets and all but 1 are exposed to the outside air directly in a very humid climate.  Several of the sockets are now so corroded they no longer function.\n\nSo I could replace them all and test with a multimeter to find the faults but what's the point?  The replacements would also corrode and probably start tripping the GFCI which leaves people in the dark outside.  Also, the socket housings are grounded so the ground fault currents are just going to ground and wouldn't shock you if you touched them, right?  (only if you tried to reach in there and touch the hot tab while the socket was on would the GFCI provide any protection)\n\nIs this what a pro would do or what?  ",

Contractor suggested adding recessed can lighting at our expense as he said they'd be doing sheetrock work anyway and it's not a difficult installation.\n\nWe agreed on 11 lights (5 in living room and 6 in kitchen). He said he'd add traditional cans and retrofit LED kits. His quote was $3200 for this which includes all fixtures, labor, adding additional circuit to electrical panel, his O&P, tax, etc. Quite frankly that's way out of budget for me for lighting.\n\nI've been looking into the Lithonia WF4  wafer lighting and figure I could at least install these at existing fixtures (regular flush mount ceiling fixture in Foyer, two pendants over kitchen sink, track lighting fixture as main kitchen light) much easier for a DIY'er and for about $3100 less.

Do you need different color temperature on the same fixture hence the difference tubes?\n\nMy long and complicated response: First to start: Fluorescent uses ballasts, LED uses drivers. There are 3 types of LED retrofit kits for fluorescent systems (Type A, B, C)\n\n\\- Type A: This is the type you linked from [any-lamp.com](https://any-lamp.com). These work with an existing fluorescent system that utilizes a ballast. They have built in drivers that work with ballasts. This is good for people who had an old fixture in their garage or wherever and want to just make it LED without the fuss and hassle of dealing with drivers/ballasts. Still limited by ballast life though.\n\n\\- Type B: This type removes the ballast and connects directly to line voltage. They have built in drivers that work with the main line voltage. Requires modification to the fixture. Also, you can't dim a fixture with this method.\n\n\\- Type C: This type removes the ballast and installs a driver in it's place. This is the best performing system but also the most costly. Great efficiency and great controls.\n\nAt this point with your system, you're basically just buying a new light made of retrofit parts.\n\nedit: If you really wanted to go with the route you were going, what you are showing is fine. The housing includes a ballast and the LED lamps you are showing would just integrate with that ballast.",

The mineral wool is not airtight (although it helps a lot) and it’s a ton of nasty attic work to get them installed.

They are LED lights pulling 10 W each. We also installed a Lutron Maestro 150-Watt White Indoor Dimmer to control the lights. After getting the lights wired to the dimmer switch they are doing something weird. When you power on the dimmer switch, it's only turning on one of the lights. The one that works is the one that begins the daisy chain and also has the romex running to the switch. It lets that one light change brightness, however the other 3 do nothing. You can see when the one working light is on, the other 3 are getting power because you can see the little LED's lighting up. However, they are at the lowest power and won't change even if you turn the dimmer switch up to full power. We checked all the wiring, we've swapped the retrofit LED's from a non working one to the working light and they light up fine. I've tried doing the programming on the dimmer switch and it doesn't do anything. I am wondering if it's something with the dimmer switch or something with the cans. Any help would be appreciated!",

      "selftext": "Howdy! Sorry in advance if this is idiotic. A bit of background: I just bought my first house (built 1964, original owner before me) and have a degree in electrical engineering (which we all know means I know fuckall about utility electrical/code/etc) but I'm decently handy and not willing to part with my money if I can DIY. \n\n\nThe majority of the wire in the house seems to be original; cloth/paper grounded wire that is (IMO) in reasonable shape all things considered. The wire I have gotten close to isn't falling apart and seems to be dry and free of rodent damage. All of the gang boxes are strapped to ground but the ground connections on outlets are not explicitly wired to ground (just connected via the metal interface to gang). Is that okay per 250.148(C)? \n\nOn to the plans:\n\nFirst, I'd like to invest in a good whole-home surge suppression system. Any particular one I should go with (Eaton, Square D, Leviton)? \n\nSecond: I'm planning on retrofitting recessed LED cans for lighting (there is almost no lighting in this house!). One option would be to use the existing feed up to the switched outlets and run new romex to the lights instead of the outlet (I'd like to make the outlet always on). The other is to run entirely new feeds from the panel which seems like a safer choice but a hell of a lot more work and more ways for me to potentially mess up adhering to code? As long as the load doesn't exceed the original rating for the breaker supplying the feed does running new romex make sense? \n\n\nThanks!  \n\nEdit: I guess should mention I'm planning on using Lutron RadioRa2 equipment for lighting/fan control. With the LED downlights I'll have to use forward phase dimmers with a neutral connection, so there's that.\n\n50 years of \"upgrades\" panel pic: https://i.imgur.com/bW0k5vn.jpg",

I wouldn't think there is a need to run new homeruns from the panel (unless you get a bigger one and then, you'd get extra capacity), but remember that if the person who did the load calculations originally did it right, the plugs and lighting were supposed to have been figured into the mix (in your case in the way of table lamps and such) so if you're just going to add some LED lights, you'll actually be consuming LESS power than the house was originally designed for.  \n\nThen again, houses back then didn't have all the electronic crap we have today so what you'll gain by using LED's will likely be overridden by that fancy new oven, AC, and TV's that the house might have not had.

      "selftext": "Apologies if this thread is misplaced but I’m having a nightmare after fitting 100 gu10 “dimmable” LED spots in a house renovation and pairing them with 15 dimmers (from the same product manufacturer). After install the lights flicker occasionally and are not fit for purpose. After speaking to the manufacturer they state the dimmers are for leading edge and the bulbs are trailing. They do not offer trailing edge dimmers for their own bulbs and I am out of the return policy from the retailer to be able to return them. \n\nThe dimmers themselves cost over £300 (they are brushed steel) so I’m obviously annoyed but wondered if there was any way around chalking up the loss and just replacing the dimmers. \n\nA spark friend suggested replacing one led on each dimmer with a halogen that draws more current and therefore would solve the issue. Would this be correct?\n\nAlternatively is replacing the bulbs a more viable option? Do they even do leading edge dimmable led bulbs? All the bulbs I’ve looked at specify neither trailing or leading in their specs, just dimmable or not. \n\nFinally is there any retrofit solution to this issue that may solve my dilemma?\n\nMany thanks in advance for any help. I’m assuming it’s just an expensive lesson learnt if none of the above is possible.",

The housings currently use [Ideal Electric Products 102 plugs](https://www.idealind.com/ideal-electrical/us/en/products/wire-termination/30-powerplug-luminaire-disconnects/powerplug-100-series.aspx) and the new lighting (old lights are discontinued) use [Ideal Electric Products 182 plugs](https://www.idealind.com/ideal-electrical/us/en/products/wire-termination/30-powerplug-luminaire-disconnects/powerplug-180-series.aspx).

But people still hire them, cause they're cheap as fuck and they'll crawl into places you wouldn't go near with a ten foot poll. Just keep on applying and don't get discouraged. The economy isn't looking too healthy for the future right now so not everywhere is hiring. But nonetheless call every electrical contractor within 50 miles of you and email them your resume.

Exempt 15 ampere branch circuits from residential constructions.\"  \n\n\nWhat I have been told is that this means that no 15A circuits are allowed at all, no exceptions.  I understand that the AHJ has the final say on things, but is it possible to fight something as stupid as this?  The ordinance doesn't even make sense to me for what they are telling me it means.  I would read the ordinance to mean that the rules set forth in Article 210.23(A) do not apply to (e.g. are exempt for) 15A circuits.  Am I misinterpreting this?  \n\n\nApparently the whole reasoning for no 15A circuits is that people were tripping breakers and shoving in 20A breakers to keep them from tripping.  So basically the city created a new rule because people couldn't follow current rules.    \n\n\nI know it's really not that big of a deal and the majority of my circuits will be 20A, but it's hard to justify 12/3 wire and 20A breakers for LED lighting circuits and smoke detectors.  Plus I already purchased and strung my 14/3 circuits and am a little bummed.  Also, the house I am working on is mine, so I know my 15A circuits.  I also can't be responsible for ANY stupid thing the next home owner decides to do, can I?  \n\n\nThoughts?  Is there any use fighting this, or since they are the AHJ they can pretty much do whatever they want?

If they really wanted to disallow 15A branch circuits in residential construction, I'd expect a word like \"prohibit\" or \"disallow\" or similar.  Exempt almost seems like they're saying that they are exempting 15A circuits from all rules even though I'm sure that's not what they mean.  Is your quote above the entire local code article?

What do I need to do to rig up these fixtures for ballast bypass LED tubes? Just remove the \"choke ballasts\" from each end and then that's that? What are those wire/circuit board things in my picture?\n\nEdit #2: The LED tubes I got claim to be \"single-end power\". Do I even need to have the far end of the fixture wired at all?

The jurisdictions that allow it usually require a label that says \"fixture has been modified now has 120v to tombstones\" or something to that effect. Some manufactures even ship these stickers with the lamp.   This is more of a cover your ass thing. \n\nMost led fixtures don't require separate lamps.

Nothing you can buy will fit/work with these lamps, these are for retrofit only.\n\nI've found the best prices for fixtures to often be at the big box stores.  You can also contact Electrical wholesalers for price shopping. \n\nConsidering where you are at, I would wire up the tombstones to 120v and write the fixture has been modified on it, this is probably the cheapest option at this point.

      "selftext": "I'm down the rabbit hole of looking at various residential generator/ATS products and how best to tie critical loads into a UPS to both avoid loss during generator startup and also brownout situations from affecting the equipment. Location is Hudson valley in NY state.\n\nThe loads fall into 3 categories as I see it:\n- critical protection, no brownouts / mains+UPS+gen (network, security, server, emergency LEDs)\n- backed up, can go out during gen start / mains+gen (lights, fridge, hvac)\n- non-critical, can stay off during outage / mains only (washer, dryer, chargers)\n\nThe idea is to restrict the critical loads as much as possible to avoid having to shell out tons of cash for a UPS that lasts more than a few minutes. Maybe I'm thinking about this the wrong way, which is why I want a gut check. I believe I want everything hard-wired and don't want any outlets on the UPS and do everything with proper sub-panels. My idea was to structure this as follows:\n\n    service entrance (underground 200A residential)\n    |\n    main breaker load center (PoN? w/ type 2 SPD)\n    |  |\n    |  (non-critical loads) -->\n    |\n    ATS <--> generator\n    |\n    sub-panel\n    |  |  |\n    |  |  (backed up) non-lighting circuits\n    |  |\n    |  (backed up) lighting panelboard <--> lighting\n    |\n    ups (120v only) hard-wired [1] (w/ bypass switch?)\n    |\n    sub-panel (120v only)\n    |\n    (critical) -> 5-15R outlets / PDU controller\n\n[1] Tripp-Lite SU3000RTXR3UHW 30A 120V, 3kVA 2.4kW; extra batteries can be chained if needed\n\nDo people usually worry about quality of power from the genset / is there anything reasonably priced to provide some type of quality guarantees without breaking the bank? UPS will take care of critical loads, but appliances might not like crappy power.\n\nIs this a viable design or am I missing something critical here that prevents this from working as intended? I was looking at Eaton CH / lighting panels as well as Square D QO bolt on as potential options. I would prefer to spec out a pretty precise setup and then bid it out to a few electricians as opposed to giving them a vague notion and getting wildly different designs that may or may not be what I intended. I might not know exactly where AFCI/GFCI is required here, but I'd leave that to the electrician to specify. I'm completely fine with doing more research / learning if I missing something key here.

Device-specific does (internet, networking, NAS, computer), but if you start branching out, without massive battery banks you are looking at a few minutes of runtime. There is also the downside of battery replacement cycles (every 3-5 years), what to do if a UPS fails and setting up a bypass feed.

I understand from past posts that including pictures of the breaker will help me determine the proper upgrade to an AFCI that is less sensitive.\n\nMy house was built in 2009 and is in Washington, US. Here's [the breaker](http://imgur.com/tC5dUyq) labeled \"bedrooms master\" and the [panel sticker](http://imgur.com/1ljLjev) where I hope I've photographed the correct information.\n\nIt looks like I can replace my existing breaker with an [Eaton type BR breaker](http://www.eaton.com/Eaton/ProductsServices/Electrical/ProductsandServices/Residential/LoadcentersandCircuitBreakers/AFGF/index.htm).\n\nIs this the correct upgrade?\n\nIs there a better upgrade?\n\nIt looks like the LED on this breaker will tell me what kind of problem I have even if it doesn't fix my problem so I can get my wiring fixed properly.\n\nFor background, items on the circuit include:\n\n* 4 65W incandescent bulbs on an Insteon dimmer\n* 2 60W incandescent bulbs on an Insteon dimmer\n* 2 60W incandescent bulbs on an Insteon dimmer\n* 1 60W incandescent bulb on an Insteon dimmer (in a bathroom‽)\n* 1 floor lamp with LED bulb on an Insteon dimmer\n* 1 table lamp with LED bulb on an Insteon dimmer\n* Some LED lights in a closet on an Insteon on/off switch\n* Various home electronics drawing ~2.2A when active\n* Other home electronics on a 1500W UPS drawing < 0.5A\n* LCD TV\n\nThe breaker trips if the 4x65W bulbs are turned on every time, well before the lights get to 100% bright.  Replacing the dimmer didn't help.  I haven't tried restoring the regular on/off switch, though.\n\nRarely, if the TV + home electronics are active along with one of the other lights the breaker will trip.  I have moved the home electronics to a separate circuit to work around this problem.\n\nThe other lights don't cause the breaker to trip, or do with very low frequency.\n",

      "selftext": "TL;DR: I know its long, and my grammar is weird, but this is the short version..\n\nSynopsis: Two, two man teams removing old metal-halide exterior lights and installing new high output LED's. Team A is composed of the main foreman (who we will call Dave (not his real name)) and his usual helper (Aka Keith (again fake name)). Team B is myself and a Journeyman (aka Partner) with 20 years of experience, but only been with the company for a few months. We are now on week 4 of this project, and due to weather and customer requests, we are getting down to the wire. Team A has been in-charge of killing power to the old lights and if re-configuring/adding feeds to the lights. Team B is tasked with the outside work; take the old fixture down, caulk all holes, put new one up, fish MC whip through wall, and carry on. Simple.\n\nThe issue: Last week was a struggle for all. Outside work was not feasible on Mon & Tues due to Snow; Keith (Mon only) and Partner (Mon & Tues) weren't able to make it due to poor roads. Boss wasn't feeling well on Mon, so no work was done. Keith and I hung new fixtures inside on Tuesday. Wed we did a feeder pull, terminate, install new breaker, and other related activities. Boss was not feeling well those days, so it was no surprise that he called in sick on Thurs and Fri. No, Foreman on site for two days:\n\nThursday: We were back outside, and put up two new lights, a photocell, and removed 3 old fixtures in the AM. After lunch Partner and I had been informed by the customer (head of facility maintenance department, the main connection between the two companies on the customer side) to not install a fixture in a certain spot and to proceed to the next one. At this point we have run out of cut and dry work (Boss hadn't planned his homeruns or anything). Pard and I trace down the circuit for the old lights, and as we are about to suit up to go outside, the customer asks us to add a receptacle for a piece of equipment (considered a service order, and is normal for this place). Keith leaves for a Dr. appt @ 2:00, so its just my partner and me. It's a cut and dry outlet add, an outlet already existed and they just wanted another on a seperate circuit. A spare is in the homerun for this purpose, its about 15' of 1/2\" TW and we pulled about 150' of wire (that is the sum of all conductors). Easy peasy, we had it live by 4:00 pm and the customer was quite pleased with the work. \n\nFriday: I show up early (as usual, cause I wanna say Hi to everyone, they call me Spongebob for a reason), and I am informed of a 250' run of 3/4\" Rigid clamped to the ceiling cross-members needs to be slid about 7\" over. For an HVAC duct they are installing... Today. *Grumble*... I kinda take lead man, figure the best solution is to loosen straps and work the run over. a few boxes had to be moved, and the home run had to be cut with the tube cutter, compression connector, kill power, shorten feeder wires, remake joints. We knocked it out by lunch. They figured a few days.... I was quite pleased with how that turned out, and so when we got back from lunch I thought I could get the ball rolling on the inside part of the next set of outside fixtures. Up until now, the inside team was just ahead of the outside team (intentional). This reduced the amount of MC used and made the runs inside look neater. With that in mind, I sort of take point again, and proceed to plan out my circuits and figure my pulls. With much assistance from my colleagues, a plan is formed, and we begin work. The whole time I see where the next fixtures are going, and my gut is telling me these are bound to change (the customer is the kind of person that would move a couch six or seven times before deciding where to put it in the one spot it actually fits in). With both Boss and the Customer absent, I try to take it slow on the inside bit. \nKeith decides we've worked enough and he's ready to call it a day (this is at about 2pm). Partner is all for going home early on a Friday, so I'm forced to pack it in too. We ran 10' of pipe and had it all planned out.... \n\nMonday (Today): Pard and I get in at 7am as usual, pickup where we left off, and are mid wire pull when Boss shows up. He is not pleased with our current activities. I explain my reasoning (I don't mention the milking it part of Friday), and he shows me how I had really over complicated the problem, and how the solution was right in front of every EXIT sign. (yeah, the lights pull <1A and go on the Generator panels just like the exit signs, I felt and still feel like a big dumb dumb). He sends us outside... Partner and I have 4 old fixtures down, and 3 new ones up by lunch. Placed as the drawings dictated. Customer comes out side, and makes changes (saw it coming a mile away). 1 of the new lights is moved, 1 is changed out for a different type of fixture, and 1 was left alone. An additional fixture was added, but Partner and I ran out of work time. The inside team, had to undo what little we started on Fri/Mon and have yet to get power to any of the new lights. \n\nThe question: I screwed up, twice and I learned a valuable lesson. However, I wonder if I was in the right mindset to start on the inside first, and even if the outside team had done as instructed and stayed outside, would it have mattered? Tomorrow, we have to hang one fixture and then move on the next section of the building, way ahead of the other team, and face the challenge of taking down lights that are still hot (yeah, but just no and so we are forced to go inside and get even further ahead of the other team). Should my partner and I stuck to outside? Should I have called Boss on a sick day and bothered him about work? I'm not the world 's best people person (I was a nerd in school, shocker). I have no clue what when wrong here, but Boss was frustrated all day, and having worked with him for months on end, I knew he was upset with me in particular. I will fully and completely admit I screwed up the inside section, and my lack of experience is showing big time here. But was I on the right track or way out of my depth, That's the question...\n\nFYI: Partner and I use a big, diesel boom lift, working at heights from 10-30 ft above the ground with a lot of hills and obstacles in the way. Old fixtures come down easy (3 bolts, and SJO is cut and pushed inside). New fixtures require 3 or 4 3/8\" lead anchors (working with either brick or concrete throughout this project), slight modifications to the fixture mounting hardware, long hole for MC to go in wall (hidden behind fixture mounting hardware). Mount, terminate, assemble, caulk around mount plate. Partner and I did 5 new fixtures today (with only 3 to show for it).\n\nCriticism is welcomed, questions are encouraged, and comments are anticipated (this is Reddit after all). Power on friends.",

Those are the easiest, and sometimes cheaper (depending on brand), option. IMO they tend to give a bit of a harsher, more direct light, more because a lot of them lack decent diffusers. But they're bright as hell. I went with those in my living room, more because the ceiling is so high that I can just barely touch the bulbs while using my tallest ladder. There was no way I could have used a retrofit kit without buying another ladder.\n\nThere's also plenty of retrofit kits that replace everything visible, including the trim ring. They usually have 3 metal fingers that lock it inside the can, and a screw-in adapter to connect to the existing socket. They're generally pretty light, just sometimes a pain to get to lock. They're also going to be the best looking option, IMO, as long as you get all of them to match. That's what I went with in our kitchen (which is all remodel cans). They seem to give a much softer light due to usually having a built-in diffuser, but they're still plenty bright.\n\nObviously I'm not an electrician, just relaying my own experience with LED swaps.",

Some were caused by overloaded or combined circuits, others caused by shitty junctions, but a few lingering issues seemed to be starting from the supply side. At night time I'd get a 8-10v spread between my two phases. My vacuum would even sound noticeably different depending on where it was plugged in. I ended up having Duke come out where they found my neutral wire frayed, but that still didn't seem to fix the voltage blips. Any moderate power draw device would cause LEDs in the house to flicker. 1000w smoker, microwave, AC condenser, etc would all make lights dim for a split second as they turned on. Decided to live with it up until I ran into an Ops Tech at work and bounced my residential question off of him. Way overkill for someone who deals with grid layout and substations, but worth a shot.\n\n\n\nDude ended up coming over to check out my house while I was at work, paced out the service drop and started looking at how the poles were configured in my neighborhood. He ended up finding out that the original neighborhood layout had me connected to a pole with a transformer >300 ft away from my house, which was loaded up with 5 other high-draw houses. \n\n\nhttp://imgur.com/zR6MUul (I'm the corner lot)\n\n\n\nHe also realized I have a pole directly across the street on the other side, with a transformer serving only 2 houses. After a meeting with a project coordinator my service drop is pivoting to the other street. For now its staying 100A, but this should take care of my off-balance 120V legs and odd voltage drops in evenings as other houses ramp up there loads. ",

      "selftext": "I had posted this a few days ago to another sub, but I thought the experts at /r/electricians might have some good ideas.\n\nWe just installed an [Allen & Roth enclosed-blade ceiling fan](http://www.lowes.com/pd_331091-88854-LP8074LAZ_0__?productId=3281038) in our sons' room, with the main attraction of the model being that the blades were enclosed. Since there is a loft bed in the room (and they are still young enough that playing with the blades would seem fun), we thought the enclosed blades were the safest option.\n\nUnfortunately though, trying to have it throw any decent amount of light has been a challenge. I knew that it took four E12 candelabra bulbs, but I figured I could replace the 43 watt bulbs with some LED bulbs in the 6 or 7 watt range that would throw some decent light. After going threw some other options, I ended up installing some [7 watt 65-70W equivalent bulbs from Lohas](http://www.amazon.com/Daylight-Dimmable-Incandescent-Replacement-Candelabra/dp/B00VWC3JDK), but its still not throwing all that much light because of the frosted glass frame.\n\nIs there any other source of LED bulbs that might have something that would either fit an E12 base and have throw something brighter? (100 watt equivalent?) I considered using an E12 to E26 adapter, but the space for the bulbs is so small (only about 3.5\" deep by 1.5\" wide) and I can't find any bulbs that would fit.\n\nAny suggestions on how to get something to put out enough light so that I don't need to install another fixture or use a lamp? It doesn't actually need to be dimmable and while I'd prefer natural light, that is less important at this point than just having a LOT of light.\n\n",

      "selftext": "**EDIT: just to clarify, we are NOT talking about a rate change. We are talking about usage. From their billing statement I have a copy of, their kWh usage in December of 2023 was 1,105 while their December 2024 usage was 2,489. Additional info I should have included is that their heating is gas so it's truly just lights, computers, routers, and a few mini fridges (again all of which they have had for longer than one year).**\n\n  \n**EDIT 2: One other clarification, I am not in any way trying to suggest that the LEDs are the cause of this assuming they are operating correctly. LEDs should be much more efficient so something else is up, but it happened at the same time as the retrofit which seems highly relevant.** \n\nHi all, I'm posting this on behalf of my mom so I don't have tons of details (but I can get further details/clarification upon request). This is causing significant financial burden on their business and I'm hoping someone can give some urgent advice here as this is now costing them an additional $300/$350 per month.\n\nMy mom and stepdad own a small business property in Massachusetts that previously used florescent lighting throughout the building. As the bulbs started dying, they decided to take advantage of an energy saving plan offered by National Grid to assist them in converting their fixtures to LED lights. Electricians came in and completed the instal in August of 2024. When my mom received her first energy bill from the August-September billing period per total kilowatt usage from that period went up 60% compared to the previous year's August to September period. Similarly, the next 3 billing periods have all seen increases of between 56%-61% compared to the previous year. She reached out to National Grid and the electricians who completed the installation and someone (I think one of the original electricians) did come to the office to review/look at the work they had done to confirm nothing was wrong. They did not turn up anything and insist it's just a coincidence or that my mom has just increased their power consumption since the instal.\n\nFurther details that may or may not be relevant:\n\n* My mom insists they have not added a single new piece of equipment or major light source etc. other than the LED work that was completed. I walked throughout the property with her and can confirm I did not see anything that's been added that looked new or raised any sort of red flags to me.\n* The building is divided into two properties, each with their own electric meter. The owner of the other property happens to be an electric services company, but we confirmed that my mom's bill does match the serial number of what should be my mom's meter.\n* Other than finally getting electricians to re-look at the instal, it sounds like my mom and stepdad are getting stonewalled by the power company and the electricians who are just saying it's a coincidence.\n\nHappy to answer any and all questions. Anything I can't answer I'll followup with my mom about.\n\nReally hoping to get some answers here. The only thing I can think of is someone has tapped into their computers to mine crypto (but it seems strange that it would happen right as the instal was completed on the LEDs - also, their PCs are not equipped for something like that I don't think), or the neighbours are somehow stealing power from them? They don't have an amazing relationship with the neighbours, but my mom doesn't think that's what's happened.\n\nWhat should we be checking first?",

I bought more of the exact same model fixture, thinking I could swap in a new \"bulb\" component because that's pretty easy. No such luck: some still flicker, some just don't turn on. Do I need to replace the J-box, and is that something I can/should do myself?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChallenge 2: All 4 of the ceiling fixtures in the master bedroom went out at once. Switched the wall switch on, they flickered and died immediately. I tried replacing the lightswitch. Still nothing. The four fixtures and dimmer switch are the only thing on the circuit. What's the best way to proceed?\n\nYes, I checked the breaker box. If this is relevant: Each room is wired so ceiling fixtures are on separate circuits from wall fixtures. The guest bedroom has both a Lutron dimmer switch and a a Leviton non-dimmer. The master has just a Lutron dimmer.\n\nPlease let me know if I can provide any more helpful details. Y'all are the best.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: added switch information.",

I hear it all the time I tried to fix it myself (wasted some time and money), and then I hired a handyman he wasn't able to figure it out (waste of time and money again) then they finally call a pro and get it fixed after wasting lots of time and money. Sometimes people end up paying double because they try to go the cheapest route first. Im not an electrician but id bet its the problem with the dimmers. I have however remodeled a few homes.",

Non-compatible switches more times than not would lead to wonky dimming or none at all. You can always verify good voltage coming to the switches, then bypass the switch and make direct connections, then power the circuit at the box. That will at least take those switches out of the equation completely.  Obviously you can’t check dimming function, but you get the idea.\n\nI actually turned an old extension cord into a portable power supply by separating and stripping back the wires and adding a basic power switch. When I have issues like this and can’t figure things out I’ll pull it out, disconnect whatever is acting up from the hose power, and connect it to my extension cord that I know is providing good power. Sometimes it helps me verify that I didn’t in fact burn something out and the issue is before it (my attic is hot a hell and full of loose insulation).",

There is a sort of \"clip\" to detach the socket from the old fixture, and in the photos, I've already detached the socket. Questions:\n\n1.

This is a plaster ceiling and I used a blade to \"free\" the fixture trim from the parts of the plaster ceiling it was fused to, but still giving me resistance. Is there something else holding the fixture in place or is it just a really tight fit with ceiling and I need to pull harder? I can't remove either the black part of the white part of fixture in photo at moment.\n2. If if I manage to remove the old fixture, will I be able to install the Halo retrofit LED?

      "selftext": "Since I moved into my house a bit over three years ago, one item that has been bugging me is my lack of front lamp post. Not that I’m missing one, but that it is non-operational. I have the original one from 1964, which is designed to be gas-fired. The post is in a spot that is a safety problem, being the only possible light for curved stairs leading down to my driveway. I have a light at my front door and one at the driveway, but this is a big dark patch that is hell on my parents and in-laws reaching flashlight territory.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/POoa6tY\n\n\nThe gas line to it has been disconnected for years if not decades, and during landscaping it was accidentally chopped apart a couple of years ago. Getting the gas light operational again wouldn’t be impossible, but holy crap they are expensive… 15-20 bucks a month!!! at current gas rates. So the work of converting it to electric was started. Solar-powered lamps were quickly ruled out just based on the lumen requirement and longevity. Most solar models output something silly like 50-100 lumens, which is like an iPhone in flashlight mode. A 60W light (nothing fancy, but what would normally be in a lamp post) puts out around 800 lumens. Huge gap and unless we are talking a 4’ by 4’ solar grid feeding a lead acid battery, solar won’t work for a lamp post if you need the light for a pathway. Best case scenario even if they get close, it would require battery and solar panels to function perfectly or the solution won’t work. Hardwired really is the best option.\n\n\nOriginally, I started down the path of getting 120V to the pole, but I’d be left with trying to make it up to code as well as drilling a new hole through my foundation below grade. Permits, inspections and probably a long term leak later… that idea was just a pain. I ended up looking at some methods to install a 12V LED light, powered off a transformer in my garage and using landscaping wiring. No more code issues to worry about, but I’d still need to find a light setup that didn’t look like junk. I had settled on a ~$10 RV LED that was about 60w equivalent, a spool of 16g outdoor burial wire, a ceramic Edison socket that I could try to screw to the old gas post inside the lamp, and a 12V power adapter stolen from some random electronic kit. Pretty ghetto, but it would work. During this I stumbled across two companies that made conversion kits, designed to replace the guts of the whole operation and keep most of the original look and shape of the gas lamps. The first company leveraged a design that used a 12/24V wiring, while the other needed 120V. To bypass my original problem I went with the 12/24V platform.\n\n\nhttp://Charm-Lite.com has a really slick retrofit kit, including a copper bulb socket post designed to look like the original gas mantle holder. The setup they have is powered off a 24VAC transformer, dusk to dawn sensor and they offer different bulbs to go in it based on how bright you want it. Since I liked the look of my original lamp post fixture, having some seriously thick cast metal walls and a cool cast metal eagle on top, I wanted something that would work and look great. I ditched my ghetto DIY approach and snagged the kit.\n\n\nPart of what kick-started this process was wiring up a PoE security camera nearby, and finding out that the hole drilled for my telecom wiring had enough space for another wire. 120V would be a no-go through this point for interference reasons, but low-voltage would be no problem. I used this hole to push through my wiring for the lamp post, and had a nice quick path across my retaining wall to go to the lamp a few feet away. A quick 6-8” deep trench later and my wiring was done. \n\n\nTurns out I didn’t even need to drill into my lamp post to get the wiring in. In searching for the gas line entrance, I found the original spot it came through, chopped it away, and got my landscape wiring through. Dropped down a rope with a wrench attached, knotted that to my wire, and pulled the wire up with minimal effort. What I thought would take me hours upon hours of work turned into a project finished in maybe 30-60 minutes of total work. For how most of my DIY projects go this was hilariously easy.\n\n\nPopping the original lamp top off the post took a bit of strength since it was partially rusted in place, but it was worth it. The original steel pole was barely budging in the ground and the top was probably 5lbs of thick metal and glass. My parents more modern one would shake with a strong wind… this could stop a small car. All of the glass inside the lamp was loose but intact. I used some barkeepers-friend  to polish the glass and get it nice and clean again. With all the original brackets having turned to dust over the years, I replaced them with some washers. Thankfully all but one mini-screws came out (one didn’t but I drilled and tapped it successfully) so I had the glass cleaned and re-secured without a lot of work. \n\n\nThe kit guts installed right in place of the original gas post. Unscrewed the retaining nut for the gas assembly, and it came out in one chunk. The new Charm-Lite post has two large washers and a retaining nut to install in that same spot. Last was the dusk to dawn sensor drilled into the lamp post and a few wires to attach to one another with twist nuts. With the wiring together I dropped the old top back on the post and waited for the sun to go down.\n\n\nLast step since I now have a working lamp post is admiring this new patch of light that hasn’t existed in the three years since we bought the place and working out some other lighting projects. The 24V transformer has some un-tapped capacity and will probably be serving an LED strand for the lamp post during the holidays. I’m also thinking about a landscaping light or two from this line. This low-budget project ranks up there with my favorite ones to date. Those include light switches in my bathrooms with an LED built in (6 bucks each), Lutron Caseta switches all around the house for dead simple and reliable home automation, and building my own playset for my kids that could easily handle a car parked on top of it. \n\n",

I have one of the older homes in the neighborhood, so I had some old carry over items where other homes had more modern elements. Most neighbors have modern lamp posts. Running gas to power a nostalgic light is also insane in of itself... almost like driving a classic car around for shits and giggles on leaded gas. They consume a ton of natural gas (15-20 bucks a month) and for vanity it just isn't worth it.\n\n\nRunning the wire 8 feet took me under an hour in time. The light post and inside are still unmodified. The original gas post if someone was really crazy and wanted to use it again would just be replaced (was clogged with dirt and spiders from a few decades).\n\n\nTo top it off if I wanted to get it operational on gas again, I'd need to pull a new gas line about 80 feet to my meter, pull a permit to reconnect it and have a certified gas tech re-plumb my outside pipes to work with it. Part of the new line would also need to be trenched under a sidewalk. It was all gutted long ago and permanently disconnected by Duke when they updated the gas lines in the area.

      "selftext": "i've begun the process of cutting out all of the stupid CFL ballasts in my 9-year old house so i can install the retrofit LED cans that you can get at costco, lowes, or (in my case) on amazon. the wiring is pretty straightforward, and after watching about 10 billion youtube videos and reading another 10 billion articles on how to do it, i've done the entire downstairs without issue. getting ready to move upstairs, but i'll probably wait until it cools down a bit as i'll want to get up into the attic to move insulation out of the way so it doesn't end up all over the floor upstairs when i take the can out.\n\nthat being said...i do have a question. first, let me preface this with the obvious disclaimer that i had shut off the breaker on every single one of these before touching them, and verified with a voltage tester that the entire box was dead before disconnecting anything.\n\non a few of the bypasses, i got a slight tingle shock from the ballast itself even though the power was off and had already been disconnected. i'm guessing there's a capacitor inside the ballast that gave me said shock, but i'm curious how i can make sure those caps are discharged before i go about doing any more of these. or, is something else at play here that's causing this? if so, i'm a little confused and perturbed, because like i said i've verified every time that all the lines in the box are dead before touching anything.\n\ni only got shocked on two of the 20 i've already done (after the second i made sure to wear gloves when cutting the wires, but i did get a small spark on a few others when cutting the wires from the ballast to be able to tape them up and wrap them into the back of the box...so the overwhelming majority were done without incident. just trying to make sure all of the 12 upstairs i have yet to do are done without incident as well. i've been searching for days and haven't been able to find any details on what kind of capacitor/ballast would cause this (nor anyone in the numerous youtube videos / articles i've read mention the possibility of getting zapped by a capacitor inside the ballast), so i figured i'd just bite the bullet and ask here in case anyone had seen this.",

[I managed to find adapters on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07J9XHJGC/) and everything connects together and the light lights up. Originally I wanted to go into the attic and attach the transformers box to a nearby beam/stud but I'm finding access very difficult and nearly impossible.\n\nHowever, I managed to get it to fit by stuffing the adapter and transformer into the housing and its kept in place by the LED light itself. Luckily, the clips fit nearly perfectly into the sides of the housing. It works, and it turns on.\n\nHowever, I wanted to know, is this dangerous? Like will they overheat or something or burn? My logic was, that the transformers are usually just put above the drywall and surrounded by insulation anyway, so maybe it would be fine?\n\nBut I'm not very experienced with this stuff, so please tell me if what I'm doing is dangerous and stupid. I've taken it off for now, until I know for sure that this won't cause a fire or anything.",

It was a nightmare, and the \"alternative\" clip that it offered didn't work at all. The pressure clips on the old cans themselves were also a nightmare to put back in, once they got pulled on even a little bit trying to put in the retrofits they did not want to go back in correctly.\n\nEnded up getting full replacement ones, sort of like this: https://www.homedepot.com/p/Halo-LT6-Series-6-in-Selectable-CCT-3000K-5000K-Canless-Integrated-LED-White-Recessed-Light-Trim-Direct-Mount-Dimmable-LT6089FS351EWHDMR/316522126\n\nand it was so much easier just to remove the old cans and rewire the new ones.

          "body": "I separate recessed lighting into three components.  You have the fixture (the actual chassis that has the bulb socket and is hidden inside the ceiling), the trim (the decorative surround that hides the metal lip of the fixture) and then the bulb.\n\nYou typically don't need any specialized tools to change the lights other than a ladder to reach them bulb itself.\n\nLegacy 6\" Recessed lights use BR30-38 bulbs depending on the trim, some might even use BR-40 although that's a pretty big bulb.  Quite simply, just replacing the bulb might be the easiest thing to do.  You can purchase replacement trims also if you don't like what you have already or if they've yellowed with age.\n\nHowever, if you are wanting to replace the trim or go for a sealed beam, seamless look, all in one LED Trims may be the way to go.  Most come with options to allow you to install inside of the two most common fixtures; Spring mounted arms (installed) that catch onto the mounting brackets and allow the trim to be pushed up.  These lights come with an adapter that screws into the light socket like a regular bulb and then slide into place.\n\nYou don't want to use a 'canless' trim, as this replaces the fixture, trim and bulb.  This can be done, but it would better to use someone with experience doing so (electrician).\n\nThere are a lot of option out on Amazon, but I like to be able to see my product before I buy it.  I recommend any big box store where you can look at the options before you buy them.\n\nI use HD only because I have a higher credit limit and they are usually more conveniently located to me.  Also, the return policy with a big box store is easier to deal with than online.\n\nhttps://www.homedepot.com/p/Commercial-Electric-5-6-in-Color-Temperature-Selectable-Integrated-LED-Recessed-Trim-4-Pack-NS01dA09FR2-259/314018779\n\nhttps://www.homedepot.com/p/Commercial-Electric-Ultra-Slim-6-in-Canless-Selectable-CCT-Integrated-LED-Recessed-Light-Trim-with-Night-Light-Feature-900-Lumens-53828101/313658680\n\nAre two easy examples.\n\nhttps://www.homedepot.com/p/Philips-Color-and-Tunable-White-5-6-in-LED-65W-Equivalent-Dimmable-Smart-Wi-Fi-Wiz-Connected-Recessed-Downlight-Kit-2-Pack-555623/310804008\n\nIs a smart (wi-fi) version.",

For the brand new lights, we added some cans and can use the retrofits, but one spot doesn’t haven’t room for a can.  So I need a canless light.  The issue is that I can’t find any that have the same appearance between the retrofit and canless.  Why the heck is that?  HomeDepot had a display for each kind and literally none of them look the same. \n\nSomeone had recommended a brand to me (Halo), which look similar, but the lumens are different. \n\nI don’t even want the kind where you can switch the temperature (I want 2700k).",

      "selftext": "A little while back, I did a quick and cheap retrofit on some CFL based recessed light cans where the ballasts had failed. By removing the bulb place (which in my fixtures was mounted to an inner can) I was able to access the junction box and bypass the ballasts. I then used a 4 pin to e26 adapter to let me use regular LED bulbs. \n\nWhile it works, I still feel a proper fix would be something that doesn't involve the socket adapter.\n\nMy concerns are a lack of thermal safety sensor, a future homeowner not being aware of the ballast bypass, My home is in California and I'm concerned about how secure the socket adapters are in an earthquake prone area, and the added length from the socket adapter means I can't get the bulbs to sit as far in the cans as the other cans that I believe use e26 sockets (I haven't messed with those in a while so this is from memory).\n\nRight now, I'd like to find a way to retrofit the existing fixtures so everything in the home matches. I also get the impression that replacing the fixtures will involve drywall work which I'd strongly like to avoid.\nTo do that, I think I'd need to find a replacement for the socket plate or modify the existing socket plate by replacing the socket on it. \n\nIs there a common place for manufactures to ID themselves on the fixtures or a place I can browse through a bunch of images to try and ID mine so I can try to order parts? Alternatively, are there 'universal' kits that can help me retrofit my fixture by modifying the socket plate or a new socket plate instead?\n\nI mentioned being concerned about the lack of a thermal cutoff switch. I don't recall seeing one on the fixtures I have performed the ballast bypass on, I assume because they are for CFL bulbs. Even though I only intend to use LED bulbs in the fixtures, I can't control what someone does in the future and not having a thermal switch may violate code (San Jose, CA). Something else that may factor into that is that all the fixtures I've modified have been on interior ceilings (there is another floor directly above them)\nI do have a few fixtures that are failing or have failed on the top floor and I've procrastinated looking at them because of the potential thermal issues so this is something I'd like to get a handle on before figuring out a course of action for those. \n\nOr am I totally wrong about the need for drywall work and the fixtures can be replaced without cutting big holes in my celling that I need to then mud, sand, mud, sand, texture, then paint? Is there a way I can ID fixtures that can take the baffles from my existing fixtures in an effort to keep things looking consistent?",

I don't know anything about them but that they can't have more than a 35 watt halogen bulb.  If you put anything bigger in it burns out really quick and damages the fixture.\n\nI'd like to replace these with something like this - [https://www.homedepot.com/p/Commercial-Electric-Ultra-Slim-6-in-Canless-Selectable-CCT-Integrated-LED-Recessed-Light-Trim-with-Night-Light-Feature-900-Lumens-8-Pack-53828101-8PK/314914184](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Commercial-Electric-Ultra-Slim-6-in-Canless-Selectable-CCT-Integrated-LED-Recessed-Light-Trim-with-Night-Light-Feature-900-Lumens-8-Pack-53828101-8PK/314914184)\n\nI'd like to know if this would work.

There's a junction box mounted on the side with old wiring (1960s building).  There is an earth in the j-box but I guess whoever installed this lamp decided earths aren't important.\n\nI don't really want to have to get up in the attic and remove the old box, add new drywall to install the kind of box my lamp expects.  I guess I could screw some plywood over the hole and screw the lamp into it, but then it probably not sit flush to the ceiling.\n\nIs there anything that would adapt just an 8x8 box to normal sized that I wouldn't have to fabricate myself?  Or should I just look for a new lamp that like the old one screws into the ceiling around the edges?\n\nThanks!",

      "selftext": "My living room currently has no ceiling lighting. The ceiling is 8' 2\" tall and flat. 15' x 13'. Electrical challenges aside, I am looking for advise on what *type* of light to put up. Above this room is another room with hardwood flooring (with space for a joist in-between).\n\nWhen I first started researching this, I saw that wafer canless retrofits were the main result when I googled \"recessed lighting.\" There are a ton of brands on Amazon and these were the first to come up for big box stores as well.\n\nWhen I sent my handyman the type I chose ([Halo 6\" Canless Wafer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09RQ29CW7/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00?ie=UTF8&th=1)), he said that the wafers are better for shorter ceilings or when you can't get enough lights for a large area and that I should consider baffled units for more control. I hadn't really looked past my first search, as there were many options to go through already and finding one that was 90 CRI instead of 80 took a good chunk of time.\n\nUpon looking into baffled lighting, I learned that baffled lights supposedly have a softer glare because of the recessed ridges, which absorb some of the light. However, the majority of these require a pre-existing can. The ones that act like the canless wafers have pretty small baffles and there are very few options. They are a bit more expensive than the flat ones, but I chalk that up to only selling single piece instead of multipack. [Here is an option I found at Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/p/RL-6-in-Color-Selectable-2700K-to-5000K-Remodel-Canless-Recessed-Integrated-LED-Kit-RL6069S1EWHDMR/306673240).\n\nAny advice or experience on canless recessed lighting (or other options) would be greatly appreciated! I would send it on the second option except that it seems so uncommon compared to the wafer type. Thanks in advance!",

If not, use the other ones. To me, placement of the lights was more important than the type of light so being able to put them exactly where I wanted (often directly under a joist) meant I went with wafers. FWIW, I used those exact wafers in my kitchen, bathroom, and basement and have no complaints. In some ways I feel like recessed cans look very 90s while flat LEDs feel more modern. Do try to calculate the amount of light at that height to make sure it’s not overpowered/underpowered. But if you’re looking at CRI then you’re probably ahead of the game. Also, again, make sure the cutouts are the same size (these are often .25” bigger/smaller than what it says on the box). You can only use a hole saw the first time, then you have to use a jigsaw.",

      "selftext": "First time posting here, but I have explored all the options my electrically-challenged mind can think of.\n\nI had two old linear fluorescent lights in my basement bathroom.  Both lights worked when I replaced them.  I bought one of those 12-packs of \"pop-in\" LED's on Amazon to replace them.  I already installed a few in my kitchen and they work great.  They have a j-box where you just connect black-black, white-white, ground-ground.  \n\nI removed the old lights, wired up the new ones, plugged in the fixtures, turned the breaker back on, flipped the switch... only one of the lights turned on.   I tried a different light from the 12-pack, and still no cigar.  I tried a couple different of the provided j-boxes, and a couple other lights with no luck.  I even used wire nuts instead of the provided 'pop-in' connectors.  I'm fairly certain my connections are adequate - I've wired up several lights and other fixtures before. \n\nI used my proximity voltage detector, and it's telling me I have voltage on the old 14-2 wire, and on the wire that connects the j-box to the fixture.  I really don't want to mess around with cutting our drywall, or installing new wire (I believe there is an outlet wired between the two lights - it's difficult to tell by tugging on the wires.  And the wiring is run through/parallel to the floor joists). \n\nAny recommendations on what my next steps to investigate should be?  I'd be happy to provide photos, or more info.  I'm just at a loss, and my dad who's helped me renovate the bathroom also didn't have",

      "selftext": "Hi, all, I'm in need of some help finding out what type of light I need to find in order to replace a ceiling light that's been flickering on-and-off. I've searched for \"circline led ceiling light\" and \"led ceiling light retrofit\", but nothing comes up that looks like what I need. The only identification I have to go off of is the info on the LED driver: Espen Technology 23W Constant Current LED Driver (VEL19090120HDA-1, SKU: 905-590). A visit to their website gives me the driver, but not the light. I've posted pictures below, but it looks to be three flat circuit boards that, together, make a circle. I've never seen a light like this before, and this house was remodeled by the previous owners 3-4 years ago. If possible, I'd rather replace the LED strips, rather than the entire light as it's in a hallway a few feet away from an identical light and I want them to match. Any help or direction would be appreciated!\n\nPictures of ceiling light here:  \n[https://imgur.com/a/AdOdOMW](https://imgur.com/a/AdOdOMW)",

      "selftext": "Apologies, it seems similar questions have been asked but am still confused on this point.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n\n1. Have hired a contractor to do a full remodel and new new ceiling is currently in the process of being installed.\n2. There are rooms above/it isn't an attic so ceiling will be inaccessible once installed\n3. Contractor has asked me whether I want can lights or canless. Labor cost will be the same for me as its a fixed price. I will purchase the cans+light or the canless LED.\n4. Contractor has stated the lighting layout I have selected will work with either canless or cans, no issue with space/joists.\n5. Ideally I would like to be able to adjust my LED lights in some manner so I can switch between more yellow to more white regularly. I don't mind if it is via an app, or a switch on the wall etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was looking at something like this:\n\n[https://www.homedepot.com/p/Commercial-Electric-Slim-Baffle-4-in-Color-Selectable-New-Construction-and-Remodel-Canless-Recessed-Integrated-LED-Kit-4-Pack-91475/310136104](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Commercial-Electric-Slim-Baffle-4-in-Color-Selectable-New-Construction-and-Remodel-Canless-Recessed-Integrated-LED-Kit-4-Pack-91475/310136104)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt lets me set the color one-time before putting it in the ceiling, but unfortunately doesn't let me change it regularly. It seems like it might be the easiest so if I can't find anything I will just go with the above.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Any thoughts on which would be more future proof? It seems that a lot of LEDs are retrofits kits on the canlights - e.g. Philips Hue. Fewer options for canless.\n2. This is for a decent sized second living room/games room. I was told 4\" is now the norm and not to select 6\". Old lights before the ceiling remodel were 6\" cans so to compensate have put in more 4\" lights.\n3. I liked Philips Hue but don't really care for the different colors and it seems they don't have any canless options. White/yellow gradients are sufficient for me. Any canless LEDs that allow you to change the color via app/switch instead of a one-time setting?\n4. If a canless LED needs to be changed, will it cause more issues requiring the ceiling to come down? Since the junction box will be recessed in the ceiling? With cans you can just unscrew the bulb and replace it. But I am wondering if the trend is to move away from the big bulky cans?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**tl;dr:** cans or canless LEDs? Labor cost/ease of install isn't an issue. Interested in future proofing/ease of replacement. Ideally would like to change between warm white/bright white myself on a regular basis.\n\nThanks so much in advance!! :)",

Sleek looking and good diffusion/glare reduction.\n    \nGood afternoon Home Improver'ers!\n\nI have a limited amount of time to renovate our 1950's attic **before it's blown to high hell with insulation.** \nAnyways, I'm designing, cutting/installing and running electrical for recessed lighting for the entire first floor. Here's what I'm using:\n\n- [6\" Airtight IC Can's](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Commercial-Electric-6-in-Aluminum-Recessed-IC-New-Construction-Airtight-Housing-6-Pack-CAT7ICATA-6PK/202256649)\n- Standard LED rated Dimmers\n- 15 AMP Circuit / mix of 14/2 and 14/3 NM circuits\n- 2700k \n\n**I ignorantly thought that LED light quality, diffusion and overall feel would remain static across brands/models of the same specs.**\n\n**WRONG.**\n\nLED's I've tested:\n\n-  [Commercial Electric\n5/6 in. Matte White Integrated LED Recessed Trim](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Commercial-Electric-5-6-in-Matte-White-Integrated-LED-Recessed-Trim-5-Ways-4-Pack-NS01aA11FR1-259/303780877)\n\n **GOD Awful. The GLARE was horrible, major eye strain. Dimming ability was poor, lack of ribbed baffle & low ceilings is no good.**\n\n- EcoSmart 2700k 4 pack. - Better, not great, pretty glaring.\n\n- Philips \"Wiz\" Smart bulbs (Home Depot) - Not Hue. Flush with our low ceilings is pretty harsh on your eyes and their behavior is sporadic. If I turn them off w/ a normal switch, half of them come back on as a different color or some don't light up at all.\n\n- [6 in. 75-Watt Equivalent Dimmable CEC White Integrated LED Recessed Retrofit Trim Downlight, Soft White \\(6-Pack\\)](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Feit-Electric-6-in-75-Watt-Equivalent-Dimmable-CEC-White-Integrated-LED-Recessed-Retrofit-Trim-Downlight-Soft-White-6-Pack-LEDR56B927CAMP6/304142655)\n\n World's better. Great dimmer range and better anti-glare properties due to the baffle & diffusion.\n\n However, these don't have the best light diffusion & flickering occurs sporadically. I'm hoping to find something with even better anti-glare properties, preferably a little deeper set into the ceiling.\n\nQuestion:\n\n- What **brands and styles** of 6\" Retrofit's are of the best quality?\n  - Looking for soft, high quality diffusion\n  - Relatively deep recession into the ceiling\n  - Flicker / glare free\n  - 90+ CRI\n\n- What should I use to cut the holes? \n  - I've gone through 2x Milwaukee Adjustable Cutting bits with the plastic dust catcher.\n\n**- PS:** I know the LED world is the wild west at the moment.",

T5s are the fluorescent of choice now, and LEDs offer some advantages. Another commenter is correct about the way they distribute light though.\n\nAlso, learn about color rendition and your desires in that department. Your T12 hyperlink shows a CW (Cool White) tube which will be bluer in the 4000K range than a more yellow Warm White in the 2700-3000K range. The photo of your room looks around 2700K to me. Old tubes sometimes will do that though.\n\nEdit: I’d lean toward something color changing myself, where you can dim and dial in the brightness and color to your liking.",

      "selftext": "Video of their behavior here: [Imgur Video](https://imgur.com/a/Y2oc7dI)\n\nThe behavior is really inconsistent; sometimes they turn on and off just fine. Other times they cycle and flash as in the video until they settle themselves and behave normally; the dimmer switch behaves weirdly along with it. I’ve never seen this before with any of my LED fixtures or bulbs. Seems to happen mainly when turned on to a lower brightness level. After they “settle”, they remain on without an issue. \n\nThese are on a 3 way circuit replacing a light fixture that was in place prior. Both ends are Lutron Maestro LED+ switches (one is a “companion” version) purchased in July last year so they should be current models, and Phillips LED bulbs were used in the old fixtures with these switches. No wiring was changed aside from connecting the electrical boxes at the point where the old fixture was, all that came in was a hot & neutral (conduit electrical here).\n\nThe spec sheet lists the Maestro LED dimmer as being compatible as well. The SKU for these from Home Depot is [53807101](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Commercial-Electric-Ultra-Slim-6-in-Canless-Color-Changing-Integrated-LED-Recessed-Trim-All-in-One-Downlight-900-Lumens-Dimmable-4-Pack-53807101-4PK/311021723)\n\nReally at a loss here. Any advice is appreciated.\n\nEDIT: In case anyone stumbles upon this: it was the dimmer- it is faulty. Swapped it with an identical dimmer (same model, purchased at the same time, no wiring changes) and the lights are fine now. Go figure!",

      "selftext": "Hi,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn my jurisdiction NMC (romex) is forbidden for some reason. I want to install LED can lights above the finished ceiling but there's the extra layer of complexity required since I have to use Flexible Metal Conduit (or EMT...). I am having trouble how I should attach the retrofit lights to the FMC. is there a small junction box I can use that doesn't need to be attached to a stud/joist? Its going to be challenging working thru a little 4 or 6 inch hole to try and attach a junction box to a joist. Maybe the underside of the floor would work? I was thinking of a retrofit box like this that clamps to the back of the drywall, but it looks like it would interfere with the mounting mechanism of retrofit can lights.

          "body": "You have a 4\" New Construction Recessed Light Housing, I don't recognize the manufacturer but it really doesn't matter.  You need a Trim that comes with 'Helicopter' Blades or 'Batwings'.  Examples include these Halo Products.  \nhttps://www.homedepot.com/p/Halo-RL4-Series-4-in-Soft-White-Selectable-CCT-Integrated-LED-Recessed-Light-with-Retrofit-Baffle-White-Trim-RL4069S1EWHR/304533540\nhttps://www.homedepot.com/p/Halo-RA-4-in-White-Integrated-LED-Recessed-Light-Adjustable-Gimbal-Retrofit-Trim-with-Selectable-CCT-2700K-5000K-RA4069S1EWHR/305734703\n\nThe type of light doesn't matter, nor the brand.  What matters is the friction bars.  Helicopter blades will swivel like a folding knife and uses friction to hold it into place.  If you press the trim in, then screw it clock wise it will snug up and the blades tighten to hold it into place.  Swivel counter clockwise to remove.  Batwings just press in and the double edges hold onto the inner housing.  You can adjust the width of the wings with a screw before installing it.\n\nYour spring loaded trims are 'can-less' in that they don't require a fixture to install.  https://www.homedepot.com/p/Halo-RL-4-in-Color-Selectable-2700K-5000K-Remodel-Canless-Recessed-Integrated-LED-Kit-RL4069S1EWHDMR/306659330\nThe electrical junction is made up in the J-box provided on a short whip.  This can be installed but you have to do some de-constructing of the existing light which is a little more complicated than this post.\n\nAgain, the trims I've chosen are just the first ones that show up on the website and are examples of the clamp type, not a recommendation for any brand or style.",

The house is about 22 years old, and to my knowledge the fixtures are the originals that were installed. \n\nI've been buying LED bulbs for them (the flood shaped, normal recessed lighting kind) but have had some burn out very quickly (last longer than incandescent but bot as long as CFLs!). I also see the LED recessed lighting conversion/insert things that screw into the socket as an option instead of a bulb.\n\nIs there a \"compatibility issue\" with some recessed lighting and LED bulbs? If so, is there a way to tell if your recessed fixtures are LED compatible? \n\nThanks!",

I've done a good amount of flooring, drywall, framing (including doors), am comfortable with simple electrical (I don't trust myself with wiring new breakers and anything over 120V), plumbing (non HVAC stuff), etc. I've sided a home, built a large shed from the ground up, put in windows, kitchens, bathrooms, etc. However, this simple question is stumping me and I think maybe I'm simply overanalyzing this.  \nI'm buying a new house tomorrow and the house has 30+ recessed lighting fixtures. I like to do my best to be energy efficient and save money (my wife loves to leave lights on) and my first simple fix for this is to replace all the recessed lighting with LED. I've just assumed I could buy a bulk pack of LEDs and go nuts. However, I've seen pigtail setups often when searching and am now wondering if LEDs are for some reason incompatible with recessed lighting (house was built about 30 years ago and I'm going to assume all these fixtures are original.)   \n\n\nTL;DR - Can I just take the old bulbs out of the fixtures and screw in some LEDs for some sweet, sweet savings?",

      "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nI wanted to replace an ugly ceiling light with a LED light, so I bought a \"Retrofit LED Kit\". Pic attached, but it's one of those that has the E26 Socket Pigtail which plugs into the new bulb/trim in one.\n\nWhen I took the current trim thing out, I found there is no housing inside. Literally it's just an electrical wire with an E26 socket. I attached a pic of the old trim.\n\nSo, the question is can I still use this without a housing? Or do I need to install a housing first? Also, where in the world do I attach the ground wire to? Also I'll have to figure how to make it stay since the tension clips probably won't work without a housing....\n\nPics: [https://imgur.com/a/UC1JpAC](https://imgur.com/a/UC1JpAC)\n\nThanks.",

      "selftext": "Hey gang, \n\nSo I have an old, non-working, square recessed light in my little foyer.   You can see some pics here.  https://imgur.com/a/MFIgAAf\n\nThere's no power at the bulb socket, but the wires connected to it are definitely hot (my non-contact voltage tester goes crazy.)  Is there ANY way to fix this without breaking out the lath & plaster, pulling the whole light apparatus, installing a new modern box, patching the ceiling and then installing a new fixture?\n\nIf the socket was getting power, I'd just throw a new bulb or maybe an simple LED retrofit in there and call it a day, but I'd prefer not to have to deal with wrecking the plaster if I can help it.\n\nI'm sure there's a not-to-code-at-all world where I cut those wires before they get to the socket and splice them into an LED retrofit like this: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GZM9G5J/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_uTqoCb6GZV4WJ\n\nBut that's a real bad idea, right?  Right?\n\nAnyway, any advice or guidance would be appreciated.\n\nThanks!",

The description said “dimmable” but is the result of poor translation because you can only change the warmth of the color but not the brightness (confirmed with seller) and this light is VERY bright for the small room it’s in.  Unfortunately the unit only functions with a remote and not the wall switch. We have easy access to the fan/light electrical unit because it is in the attic above the room. Is there some sort of retro-fit LED remote control dimmer that can be added to the electrical supply to the light only? I would hate to have two remotes but this seems to be the only way to make this work for us. \nI also wonder if there is a universal ceiling fan/LED light remote with color control and dimmer included that could replace the existing remote. I briefly looked online and didn’t see anything like this, however. We may not need color control because it seems the light warmth is determined by cycling through turning it off and on, each “on” it goes to the next color. \n\nI’m realizing this product is a complete POS. But again, it’s pretty and it’s installed so please me make it work. Open to any idea.",

In the event you have a power spike or something else happens and you'll wind up having to replace the whole fixture(read that as having to rehire the electrician to replace it) rather than just replacing a bulb.\n\nAs far as whether to use retrofit or new construction fixtures that's up to you and your electrician.   New construction will be sturdier, but will require more patching and as the other user said unless you're taking down the ceiling or don't currently have one it will require alot more drywall repair if you don't have access from above the ceiling.   You shouldn't be hanging from your recessed lighting so if you have a ceiling in the room and don't have access from above I'd go with remodel fixtures since they'll require less/no dry-wall patch work and they'll do the job just fine, but ultimately the cost difference between the two shouldn't be much and home depot has a great return policy so whatever your electrician wants to use should be fine as long as they're not leaving a ton of holes for you to have to patch up after the fact.",

      "selftext": "I'm designing a full gut renovation of my grandfather's old house in New Hampshire (early 1900s; this is my first reno ever). Given that I've been tearing out everything down to the old posts and will be moving walls around, I'm presented with a great opportunity to implement a lighting & control system from scratch!\n\n**What I'm looking for**\n\n* LED-only\n* Variety of bulb types for recessed, track, pendant, under/in-cabinet, sconce, lamp, etc implementations\n* Dimmable almost across the board\n* Bulb color temperature adjustment would be great, though not a deal-breaker\n* No need for fancy colors\n* Controllable by mobile app (Google Home, Apple HomeKit, or equivalent and ideally agnostic between them — mostly I'd like to avoid janky apps half-assed by bulb manufacturers or flash-in-the-pan home automation companies with horrid user interfaces), voice assistants (agnostic as well), and physical dimmer switches (aesthetically minimalist is important!)... please no dedicated tablets, wall-mounted screens, etc\n* Ability to map bulbs' states to scenes\n* Not opposed to motion sensors in main spaces (for navigation lighting only)\n* Ability to turn off lights when not on the home WiFi network would be slick for those times I forget on my way out\n\nI don't like looking at most smart hubs because they're usually pretty ugly (I'd describe the current-gen Nest WiFi router as almost perfect whereas the Philips Hue Hub is far from it) so solutions that have next to no extraneous hardware, integrate with an existing suite of smart speakers, or whose boxes are either pretty to look at or visually disappear would be easy favorites.\n\nI also have a pet peeve about switches: I want physical controls in every space as silent/phone-less fallbacks but I hate situations where multiple switches control the same bulbs and the position of at least one switch doesn't correspond to the bulbs' states (a problem exacerbated by app/voice assistant integration). Therefore I'm very interested in buttons, capacitive sliders, knobs without limiters, or switches that return to neutral after being pressed.\n\n**What I've found**I use GE C-Life bulbs in my apartment. They were easy to retrofit into existing hardware and got me hooked on controlling lights without getting up from the couch. They also connect directly with my Nest Minis, so there was no extra hardware or software to set up or look at. Unfortunately they have very limited functionality, and they mean all my switches are up all the time which looks weird and causes confusion for visitors when their first flick doesn't do anything.\n\nBecause of this, I feel like smart bulbs and hubs are fine for retrofits but maybe not the best for starting from scratch? Unless I abandon the idea of wired wall switches in favor of those wireless wall-mounted remote controls the brands offer...\n\nThis seems to put me into the realm of dumb LED bulbs with traditional circuitry and locating all the brains in the switches? Finding switches that work both in tandem with one another for the same lights and with voice assistants (and which are also pretty) has been a headache, so I would love some direction here!\n\nI think my favorite switches so far are from Lutron and Legrand. Lutron's [Sunnata touch dimmer](https://www.lutron.com/en-us/products/pages/standalonecontrols/dimmers-switches/sunnatatouchdimmer/overview.aspx) became quick fodder for my minimalist heart, but it is unclear to me how it would handle syncing state with other switches, and it appears unlikely to respond to a voice assistant or home control app unless there's something I'm missing.\n\n**What do I need to know?**I'm not 100% certain what I should be asking everyone — I have plenty of UX targets but no real understanding of how the components come together, even with traditional bulbs+switches in an average home.\n\nIf you were to design this kind of system from scratch, what would you think about? What brands might you consider, and how would you expect the various pieces to come together as a cohesive whole?\n\nFinally, I know security has been a bit neglected by IOT manufacturers, but any suggestions that gravitate toward brands known to be better about OTA security updates, long-term support, or at the very least don't store network passwords in plain text would be AWESOME.\n\nThank you so much!",

I want to convert these to LEDs and found these really affordable ones on Amazon from Sunco: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MRKGQ10/\n\nThe main problem is that retraction mechanism in the Progress Light doesn't work with this Sunco retrofit.  Does anyone have any simple solutions to making these 2 products work together?  The spring arms on the lights are able to support them with very careful placement, but there are a few that are just stubborn and will slide down over time.\n\nMaybe covering the tips of the spring arms with FlexSeal or even just electrical tape?  Anyone in a similar scenario?",

Instead of slots or clips on the sides of the can, the old trims attached to the bulb connection and it was held in place that way.\n\nMy dad took some scrap metal and was able to make his own clips to attach to the cans in our kitchen for the retrofit LEDs to fit properly.\n\nNow I am looking to replace the trims and bulbs in the cans in our basement. I was wondering if there were any LED bulb/trim combos that would easily fit into these weird can setups.

Our kitchen has existing can lights and I wanted to replace them with these so they match. \n\nThe issue I am having is that there are 2 different types of cans in the ceiling, and 2 of the LED fixtures don't seem to fit. I am using the spring clamps to attach them inside the can, but when I go to slide the light up into the ceiling, it won't fit all the way. It looks as though these 2 particular cans just aren't deep enough?\n\nIt's almost like the spring clamps are an inch too long and are hitting the back of the can.

So called \"easy up\" all in one solutions ([like this](http://www.homedepot.com/p/EnviroLite-Easy-Up-4-in-3000K-Warm-White-93-CRI-LED-Recessed-Light-with-J-Box-No-Can-Needed-2-Pack-EV407941WH30-2/206039034)).  This is an attractive option because of the easy install and compact design, but I assume if these ever burn out I have to replace the entire fixture?  Seems like a bad idea to me.\n\nIf anyone has any experience with this type of project, some guidance would be appreciated.  I'm fine with wiring things, but I'm out of my element choosing lighting solutions.",

You are correct that you may have to replace the whole fixture if it fails, but your chances of integral LED failing is much less likely than bulb failure, due to form factor. And LED light bulbs are getting lower and lower in price with lower life time expectancy (planned obsolescence) of 10,000 hours or even less.

And that's the other problem... these kits are EXPENSIVE, especially if I were to look at doing an entire two story house with them.  At retail price each \"lightstrip plus\" is $90 for the first 2 meters, and $30 for each 1m extension from there, extendable to a max of 10 meters, so that would be $330 for 33 feet of light strip!  Plus each light strip is designed to plug into an A/C power source and has a D/C converter, and connects by wifi.\n\nI'm hoping that some or all of the above factors can be mitigated by the fact that:\n-This is new construction, so walls aren't in the way, cabling (high and low voltage) are completely flexible, etc\n-Economies of scale (looking to apply this all over on a 4000 sq ft house... ceilings, under cabinets, etc)\n-I'm tech savvy... an IT guy for my day job\n-My father in law is the builder, and while he's far from keen on cutting edge stuff like this, he's willing to give me some creative freedom and assistance from his subs\n-I have a decent budget for this... I don't mind investing some $$ for a nice finished product.  I've even thought about doing some sort of central DC power conversion and wiring if that would help this project along\n\nAny tips or guidance or even just things for me to google would be much appreciated.  This is such a wide open subject and emerging field it seems like its discussion in the context of new construction is very hard to find right now.. or what I have found is more like \"well this is theoretically possible\"\n\nAlso what are your thoughts on running this on whole-house DC, vs using AC to DC converters at each light source?\n\nWhat about lighting controls?  I know the Philips Hue retrofit fits have some nice wifi integration in them, but if I'm doing to be doing some other more reasonably priced 3rd party lights, what controls should I look at putting into place?  I'm still up in the air about smart home controls in general... it's such an emerging field, I have choice paralysis since it seems like whatever I go with now may be obsolete and no longer supported in just a couple more years.",

It has extensive landscape lighting, which is good. But it's all full 120v buried 18\" deep, which is bad. Nowadays, people are doing this with a house-mounted transformer and 12v wiring that can be run almost however you want. So I'm having difficulty finding the fixtures I want, etc. You don't want to be in my shoes in five years when your tech choice is now mostly fit for a museum or you have trouble getting replacement parts. \n\nEDIT: I know you're here to talk about lighting, but power-over-ethernet wired to key points in the ceilings for commercial grade wireless access points (that you can change out as technology improves) would be awesome.

This will allow me to add some much needed insulation to the attic without installing covers. However I'm finding there are 8 million options on brand, brightness, color and style and a huge range of prices. I think I have narrowed it down to the 3000k light color/temperature and the lowest brightness I can find (which still feels brighter than I would like) at 650 lumens but don't know if any specific brands are more reliable than any others? Any suggestions or alternatives would be greatly appreciated!",

I called an electrician to do the installation and he's given a pretty reasonable price. He said he'd get the cans and we'd get the trim. He's coming in two days and it dawned on me that I'd like to use LED lights for their energy efficiency and longevity. I called him and let him know that and he said to get retrofit LEDs and not Remodel/New Construction or it'd be much for labor intensive. Is that true? It seems like it'd actually more work and less clean to install the older cans w/ retrofit LEDs as it would to install remodel/new construction LED lights. Any insight would be appreciated. Thanks.",

          "body": "New construction Recessed Fixtures are usually installed before drywall is hung and are braced against joists permanently.  Remodel Recessed  Fixtures use clips to secure to ceiling drywall.  Normally, both come in 4\", 5\" and 6\" diameters with 6\" and 4\" being the most popular.  \n\nStick with Standard A19 Base (the light bulb socket you grew up with) 120V (US) fixture and preferably RICAT rated (Remodel, IC Rated, Air Tight).  For 6\" Lights, I use H7RICAT or H27RICAT (5.5\" Height) however any Halo, CE, Juno, etc... Any UL rated fixture are okay.  4\" 'cans' from CE or Halo can also be used.  Stay away from MR16 based fixtures for general room lighting (These are 'art' and 'wash' lights, much loved by designers and very expensive)\n\nYou can purchase Trims in many different styles and they range in price from $8-14 and then choose an appropriate LED bulb to install or use a 'sealed' Trim and bulb kit from Halo, CE, Ecosmart etc... (There are a ton of them ranging in price from $15-45).  In this case, remember that you get what you pay for.  I recently installed 20+ 6\" sealed trims ($13/each!) and 20% of them had to be repaired out of the box (bad connectors).  I've never had an issue with the $29-45 range from Halo or CE.  \n\nNote that LED's are rated to last 18-23 years... The first ones I installed were about 7 years ago and they are still burning bright.\n\nChoose your light color.  2700K is that yellowish light we all know so well but 3000K is a pure white light that goes with a more modern look.  I have my preference but it's your choice, not mine.  Don't go with 4500K (Harsh, Blueish Light) for a Kitchen or Living Room.\n\nBulb size is a consideration if you choose to go with Trims and replaceable bulbs... R20 for 4\", R30-38 for 6\" (Can be listed as BR or PAR depending on rating). \n\nHope this helps.",

Aside from the buzzing issue, the lights seem to have the brightness advertised.\n\nSept 16: Though advertised as dimmable, they emit a noticeable buzzing sound that my other LED units do not, even at full brightness. Additionally, the friction arms do not function particularly well, but this is a reflection of an industry accepted design, and a poor choice on the part of the manufacturer. I would buy a different product in the future.\"",

The only options I see are using the retrofit light without a can or redoing the other lights to match the one I get for the canless. \n\nIt’s my understanding that if I make a J-box for the retrofit wiring it should be fine since the recessed LED lighting is IC approved. \n\nIs there something I am missing, or would this work?",

          "body": "First of all, I would check your code on this.  Ethernet is considered low voltage and I frankly don't know what the implications are involving low and high voltage mixed together in the same receptacle.  \n\nAre you planning on wiring the house solely with DC or are you doing to wire it with AC and plan on using DC for the most part?  Deciding not to wire for AC would be a pretty big mistake as far as resale is concerned.\n\nWhy use PoE when you could up the gauge to 18 and either go with [18-6 thermostat wire](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Thermostat-Cable-Heating-Air-Conditioning-Wire-HVAC-AC-System-Sun-Resistant-18-6-/360578999285) or just plain [18-2](http://www.amazon.com/Gauge-1000ft-Security-Alarm-Control/dp/B00613UMS0) wire?  Cat 5/6 can obviously run DC, but I've read of people experiencing voltage drop over certain distances due to size of the wire.  Cat6 is also more expensive than basic 18-2.\n\nAs far as lighting is concerned, you might look into homo automation protocols like Z-wave, Insteon, Zigbee, etc.  [Smarthome.com](https://www.smarthome.com/) is a great resource for this as is /r/homeautomation.  Using a central hub and the appropriate switches (which run on a similar bandwidth as Wifi but different enough not to cause interference) you can control as many or few lighting areas as you want.  You can have your exterior lights come on when you pull in the driveway.  You can have music start playing when you walk in the door.  Home automation exists outside of lighting and as a matter of fact, I don't even have any of my lights automated.  \n\nEither way, take this opportunity to future proof.  Think you're only going to need a single cat5 drop?  Pull 3.  It doesn't take any longer and you'll have them if you need them.  Run a drop to every wall possible.  Think of anything network related you (or any future owners) may want and go nuts.  Also make sure to include a chase or some sort of tube with pull lines preinstalled in case you ever want to run something from floor to floor.  Some recommendations I always offer:\n\n- A secondary 5x18 thermostat wire to the second floor in case I want to do dual zone heating/cooling\n- Wires for wireless access points on every floor and in every room you could possibly want them in. - - - Remember, you don't have to give them a plate but at least run them and take detailed notes/photos/videos of where they are.\n- Multiple Cat5 (because I had it lying around), Cat6 and coax in all bedrooms and anywhere I thought I might need them. If they're there and you don't need them, all you have is a switch plate cover. If you don't have them, you have a solid multiple hours worth of frustrating work.\n- Power lines, coax and cat6 for security cameras if you think you'd like to install them at some point.\n- Power and control lines (I used 5/18g thermostat wire) for automated/motorized blinds. Again, you can hide these and use them later if you want.\n- A centralized \"home run\" for all the wiring. All my network and coax lines converge on one place in the basement. Don't be stingy with the cable lengths either. Chances are you're buying Cat6 in 1000 foot spools. You'll have spare....\n- If you're into home automation at all you might look into running low voltage lines or network lines to various places.\n\nJust for your home run network cabinet:\n\n- Network Switch\n- Network attached storage or two\n- Home control module\n- PC or two (I currently have 3 wired)\n- DVR for security camera system\n-Sonos [sound bridge](http://www.sonos.com/shop/bridge?r=1)\n- Ethernet ready IR repeaters ([Harmony Elite](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014PDFP9S/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_2?pf_rd_p=1944687622&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=B00N3RFC4Q&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=1E4ZZZ3KSPQQ9N37V2VW))\n- TV DVR/Network Box\n- Smart TV (assume one for each room)\n- XBox/Ps4/Wii\n- Chromecast/Chromecast Music\n- Wireless Access points\n- Home Theater A/V receiver\n- Media server\n\nIf you're simply going for functionality from an automation standpoint, I would wire for standard AC lights and control them via Zwave/Insteon switches.  If you're going for a drop in power consumption, just plan on buying LEDs.  ",

The concern there is you need switching and control and as far as I know there  is no current standard for that. local ac-dc conversion will be ~83% with no discernable loss to cable length. With POE it will range between 80%-84% depending on cable length and fixture wattage. Short runs like you mention with 10w (60w equiv) fixtures would be at the 84% end.\n\nLumencache has a nice DC only system that uses data cabling but it's expensive. ~$3200 for 13 lights and 8 switches. It pulls the led drivers back to the panel also. \n\n I would expect that some downsized commercial systems will be introduced to residential market over the next five years.  There is also a group working on  DC distribution standardization. Emerge alliance?  The biggest issue with DC is the cable size required to reduce voltage drop on longer runs.",

I bought enough for the whole house before I realized I have two sizes, 5\" which works well with the item I bought but other half are 4.5\" which are between all the standard sizes I've found! I have tried the 4\" ones of the same kind I purchased but they do not stay.

          "body": "Carpenter here. I do a fair amount of electrical work too. I have never heard of 4.5\" recessed cans. I did a quick [search which turned up these](https://www.amazon.com/Downlight-Daylight-450lumes-Retrofit-Recessed/dp/B01LPINVO2). They are usually meant for drop ceilings where there is very little clearance above the ceiling grid and you'd have to remove the old cans/rewire. You have pretty much two options:\n\n1) Try to remove the old cans and replace them with 5/6\" replacement cans.\n\n2) Go to an electrical supply company and ask for advice on a suitable retro trim. This could get expensive since 4.5\" cans are not an industry standard. If you can't find an electrical supply house you can try a lighting supply store or call a local electrician who may be able to source a product for you.\n\nI'll keep looking around the internet for something for a bit. If I find anything I'll update and DM you.\n\nEdit: I also found [these](https://www.google.com/shopping/product/12615994370258230571?q=4.5+recessed+light+trim&biw=1080&bih=1817&prds=paur:CmkAsKraX_hLLzGj0HifFpoZBqacMS5aueNr1NAf4FHRTv07usoQMbbB1xjtCWPrkcZaKeyFnuMOgb6GtsOH2MQtmgy6_TFQ9OEKJ8YlF1tPqOaQ5CdcMcI3iUHaPZpp_wtFyxJPrLjsNLESGQBT1R-9_wvT4I-7Eui3XIJplAvwjZHhhgo&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjIhpfRgO3hAhVxs1kKHeISBYoQ8gIIggg) and [these](https://www.google.com/shopping/product/18316935799692643433?q=4.5+recessed+light+trim&biw=1080&bih=1817&prds=paur:ClkAsKraX7m6CCoLcugkpuOoKu-Qmx1cckmOSstid_0zvUG9lUoI4SVO6Y_8ny3iYnIxYC1co0Y-8qudet1GFGIU3Sv8Uk26fdM5ix46WyZgcFnCNFul7NKVxhIZAFPVH71zQX6txVBxZr9BwJgxZxw_YgE8Vg&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjIhpfRgO3hAhVxs1kKHeISBYoQ8gII-gg), but they would also require you to remove the old can and rewire these in their place. Also the mere act of trying to remove the old cans will probably cause damage to the holes in the drywall. If you're removing them anyway you may as well replace them with 6\" retro's.",

I want to refit as LED's, and I'd prefer to go with the designs that replace the trim rings and bulbs with a sealed look ( [Image](https://www.pegasuslighting.com/images/learn/led-retrofit.jpeg) )\n\nUnfortunately, our light housings do not have the clips these replacements use, instead its a bell housing slid. the socket connects to the top of the bell, then the bell is pushed into the hole with a compression fit (3 or 4 dimples). Any products to help retrofit these housings, or do I just have the 1% of fixtures these LED retrofits don't work with?\n\nEDIT: Don't have a photo handy, I reassembled the light already, but here's a sketch:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/f0xe8mW\n\nThe retention ring is attached to the part attached to the ceiling beams, with an electrical box and light socket all wired up before the drywall for the ceiling is installed. Once the drywall is up, the hole is cut and the \"bell\" is attached to the socket and pushed into place. The bell has the \"trim ring\" integrated, so all that is left is screwing in a light bulb.\n\nBecause of this design, no Spring clips are needed with a conventional bulb.",

Here are the bulbs I've tried so far:\n\n* Feit BPCEBR30/927/LED\n* Ecosmart ECSBR3065WEW27120\n* Cree BBR30-06527FLF-12DE26\n* GE LED10DR303E\n* TCP L9BR30D27K\n\nI've tried these dimmers:\n\n* Leviton R62-06674-P0W\n* Lutron CTCL-153PDH-WH\n* Lutron MACL-153MH-WH\n* Lutron SCL-153PR-WH\n\nOut of ideas at the moment. I don't want to try ordering other things online yet because of a potentially more difficult return process. Are the bulb and dimmer the only players in the compatibility game? Could it be the recessed fixture itself? I don't know anything about the history because they came with the home when I bought it. Earlier today I talked to a Feit tech support who asked me to make sure nothing else was on the circuit that might be causing noise, but I didn't have anything else besides the switch and the bulbs.\n\nRunning out of ideas on what to do now, but I'd hate to keep using these 75W bulbs. Does anybody have any ideas? Do I just have to accept the buzzing in my life?",

      "selftext": "Hey Reddit,\n\nI recently purchased a house and the last owners were smokers, so all the light fixtures were badly stained, and honestly, just very outdated. \n\nI have replaced all of my 6\" lights on the horizontal ceilings, but on my vaulted ceilings over the family room, the cans are slightly different. The can is not 6\", it seems to be 4 7/8\". This is frustrating because the 5\" LED retrofit kit that I bought is very slightly too large and won't fit. I found some 5\" or 6\" kits that have a sliding adjustment, but can't find a 4\" or 5\" kit that could be adjusted to fit the 4 7/8\" can.\n\nI haven't tried yet, but I am assuming a 4\" kit would not retain properly as the cans don't have j-hooks for the tension rods, so it would need to be one of the friction clips. Also, I don't think the trim ring would cover the hole in the drywall.\n\n\nAny suggestions? Has anyone else run into a recessed can light being 4 7/8\" in diameter? Just looking for options that don't require replacing all of the cans.\n\n\nThanks!\n",

If the can is rated for 200W that means the can is built to carry the current (amps) required to supply the bulb with a 200W draw. The bulb itself determines how many watts it draws, the can has no say in the matter.\n\nSo if you buy a regular old halo 4\" can, you can put an LED bulb in it and it will run normally. Or you can buy one of the hardwired LED cans and not worry about bulbs.\n\nIn my mind the only reason to buy a hardwired LED can is because you like the photo metrics (the way is spreads the light) on it. Otherwise, I would go with an incandescent can with LED bulbs in it as it would be cheaper that way. ",

(I hope that info is right but that's why I chose to go with the screw bulb cans.)\n\nThere's some confusion here.  You're electrician is sort of right.  He means that in the cans that have a built in LED, there's a built in transformer. You'll rarely see this kind of fixture from a box store.  They usually come from lighting stores, and cost upwards of $100.00 each.\n\nThe cans that you are talking about just have a different connector. One is for regular incandescent, and the other is the little orange clip for the led.  You can use the screw in connector to convert a regular can to accommodate an LED module.  The transformer in both of these  cases is enclosed in the LED module.  The adapter contains no kind of transformer.\n\nAlso the connector has nothing to do with the wattage. The LED module uses something around 9-11 watts.\n\n  The housing that was linked is for new construction.  If you already have sheetrock up, you might want to consider the HALO H750RICAT.\n\nRegarding the decision to go with regular+adapter vs LED only housing...  Depending on your location.  The LED only housing is suitable for high efficacy areas (such as kitchens) And are also suitable in wet locations. (such as shower areas).\n\n",

I replaced all of the halogen bulbs with LED bulbs but they aren't nearly as bright as the halogens.  They seem to top out at around 500 lumens and are fairly expensive (~$15 to 20 per bulb).  Some higher lumen ones seem to exist but are even more expensive.  I was wondering if there were options to either (1) retrofit with a very bright (700-800lumen) 12v system that will fit the GU5.3 pins and fit into the 4\" slot or (2) somehow remove the ballast and stick in a 120V system which seems to be much more commonly available.  \n\nAny hints/suggestions would be appreciated!",

The price is insane - $5 for a two pack! That's like 1/10th the cost of others. Even the bulk contractor packs don't touch these prices. \n\nLowes has it marked as an \"Everyday Low Price\" and they've been $4.98 every time I have been in over the past couple months, so it doesn't seem to be a sale price. Further, some LED lighting is marked as subsidized by National Grid, but these don't have that marking either.\n\nAs for quality, they seem identical to other kits, with ~~perfect~~ (edit: acceptable?) fit and finish, with the same slightly annoying spring clips that all the rest have (edit: and apparently spotty quality control and/or packaging, given the missing lenses in the picture that /u/IcyKettle noticed). They do include the medium base to quick disconnect adaptor. The light quality is nice, bright, and even. They claim a CRI of 90, which looks right to me, though I am not an expert and have no way to measure it.\n\nThey do not have this item number (831963) listed on their website. \n\nI am in RI and haven't checked other stores, so I don't know if this is a city/region/state limited price, or if it's widely available.

I guess I don't see much of an advantage of the retrofits except as Rothnic points out below - there's no gap between bulb and trim.  Doesn't seem a worthwhile tradeoff to warrant getting stuck with a light that doesn't match.

      "selftext": "So I got some flush-mounting Osram lightify LED kits for my the recessed lighting that came with the house, and thought I'd have an easy time changing it out. Looks like I was thrown a curveball though - the housing does not accept the spring clips and there was no way to anchor them flush.\n\nI decide to take off the one wingnut I see in there, and the whole can falls out since the wingnut was the height adjuster and the only thing holding the can in place - also the screw holding the wingnut fell out(yay me!). So, now I am stuck with this whole contraption in the ceiling that I cannot put back together since I cannot access behind the can to put the wingnut screw back in place.\n\nSo I'm now thinking of getting the remodel recessed lighting boxes [like this](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Halo-E26-Series-5-in-Aluminum-Recessed-Lighting-Remodel-IC-Air-Tite-Housing-E5RICAT/207091957) and leaving the old components in the ceiling itself. Does this make sense? Does it affect codes in any way? \n\nPlease help. I gotta return my neighbors ladder soon :-/\n\n\n",

      "selftext": "I posted this over at /r/HomeMaintenance as well but thought maybe someone here has run into something similar.\n\nMy finished basement has 8 flush mount can lights on one circuit spread between two rooms. There is only one switch for all 8 lights. After I moved in I added retrofit LED mounts for the 4 lights in the front room. The kind that screw into the light socket and replace the trim. In the other room I put in 2 LED flood bulbs and left the other 2 lights empty. I also installed an LED dimmer to control them all.\n\nI've now purchased 8 Sengled Element Classic bulbs to replace for the entire basement. I put the first four in the room with the 2 LED floods. I tested them out and everything went perfect. Next i uninstalled the LED retro can inserts and reinstalled the original can light trim. This was simply unscrewing the retrofits. No messing with any wires.\n\nAfter getting all of the old LEDs out and the Sengleds installed on the remaining 4 lights, i switched the power back on and.....nothing. The first 4 Sengleds I installed wouldn't even turn on. I replaced a Sengled with one of the previous LED mini floods and tried again. This time the LED started strobing/flashing while none of the other 7 lights turned on. I turned the lights off, replaced the LED with a normal incandescent 72W bulb, tried again and all 8 lights came on. Last, I removed the incandescent bulb and left the fixture empty and tried again with no bulb. Nothing.\n\nCan anyone help me figure out what the hell is going on here?\n\nI took out the last 4 Sengled bulbs, and just screwed in the retro fit LED lights without changing out the trim. All 8 lights work. Is there a reason 8 Sengled 100-130v, 14 watt bulbs wouldn't work, while 4 of the Sengled's would work just fine with 4 120v 12 watt LEDs? Could this be a wiring issue? ",

      "selftext": "I’m redecorating my teenage son’s room. Its windows face north, so it is always rather dark there. Think that a larger and more luminous light source will be just perfect. Now, my son and I have a disagreement about what to install.\n\nHe wants a hanging light equipped with a thing called ‘clapper’. You clap twice and the light goes on, you clap twice and it goes off. And if you are too lazy to clap, there is also a remote control. The main reason why my son wants this thing is because, you know, it’s cool, he has seen contraptions like this on TV, and it is something you can show off. I’m sure his classmates will be awed.\n\nIt seems to me that what is going to actually happen is that my son will play with this thing for a week or two and then forget about it completely. It nothing but a toy, isn’t it? I’m also concerned about the clapper’s reliability. Can it turn the lights on or off because of some noise, like shooting on TV or knocking on the door? Does anyone have a device like this in their house? Is it of any practical use?\n\nAs for me, I initially was going to buy a small chandelier, but then decided on a nice (and much cheaper) pendant light with 55 built-in LEDS from this store: [https://lightingandsupplies.com/residential-lighting/residential-indoor-lighting/ceiling-light/pendant-mounts/](https://lightingandsupplies.com/residential-lighting/residential-indoor-lighting/ceiling-light/pendant-mounts/). To find the right size of the light source you add the room’s length and width in feet and get the maximum possible diameter in inches. It is twenty inches in my case, and I found the hanging light exactly like this. What’s more, you can adjust how luminous you want it.\n\nStill, it seems like if I don’t buy my son his prized clapper, he will be angry with me for quite a while. Going to offer him a compromise: we buy a regular hanging light plus a clap-activated table lamp to play with. Any ideas where I can get such a device at not too high a price? Don’t really want to waste money on something that seems to be nothing but a toy.\n\nThat’s it. Thank you for your time reading this. You might have some more ideas as to what I should or could do. Please, share your thoughts – any help will be greatly appreciated.",

Even with that rating listed on the box, the bulbs are lasting around 6-months or less in our 7\" recessed lighting enclosures in the master bathroom.\n\nI've been looking into LED retrofits for recessed lighting, but the majority are 6\". I'd love to find something that works like [these 5-6 inch retrofit kits](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Commercial-Electric-5-6-in-Color-Temperature-Selectable-Integrated-LED-Recessed-Trim-4-Pack-NS01cA09FR2-259/309010790). The spring brackets on these would work with our existing enclosure, and the medium base screws into the existing fixture. I can't find anything in 7\" though.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips? I'm thinking of visiting a few electrical distributors in the area to see what they carry, but I have a feeling they're going to be very focused on new construction. I'm open to other suggestions, but would *really* like to avoid any significant alterations (patching & cutting new holes). Attic access is extremely cumbersome due to mixed-height ceilings (9' and 11'), so removing the existing cans is possible, but difficult.\n\nPhotos of fixture: [https://imgur.com/a/BPJQtgh](https://imgur.com/a/BPJQtgh)",

We are signing off on electrical requests next week and I wanted to see if anyone here could help us out with ideas on how to make it easier for my DIY installation of under cabinet lighting after we close. I’ve attached a link to a picture of the current electrical and kitchen design of our home. \n\nIdeally I’d like to use one switch to control all of the under counter lights without having to run a ton of wires behind the cabinet shelves to an outlet on the top (but that might be the only option?)The challenge is on the left side where there is a window and sink separating the last group of cabinets. \n\nThank you all for your help!\n\n[Kitchen Image](https://ibb.co/qB3hspf)",

You can run wiring to multiple groups of cabinets (and there might be a limit to the number of lights that can be strung together). But once you've got the wiring behind the walls you've already done 95% of the work.",

Maybe another hour to come back once the cabinets are up to do final install. Don't think they would agree to just leaving a wire hanging but maybe if it is terminated in a box?\n\nOthers probably have other thoughts but I can't think of any other way to do this without opening the walls up later or just draping the cords to an outlet (which I agree isn't ideal at all).

Their standard markup on custom work was 30%, but they would go higher where they thought they could--especially for anything they considered a \"luxury\" upgrade. That $4000 sounds like a real money grab.\n\nFor much less, you may be able to get a switched receptacle tucked into an upper cabinet--similar to how microwaves are powered, but connected to a wall switch and not requiring its own circuit. And the electrician would also run low voltage lines from the location of that receptacle to 3 locations just below the upper cabinets: 1) left of the sink, 2) between sink and cooktop, 3) between cooktop and refrigerator. (I'm not sure what's done where the low voltage line exits the wall cavity, but surely the electrician does.)\n\nYou could then connect a 24v power supply (better than 12v for longer runs) to the switched receptacle and the low voltage lines, and install 24v LED tape light in aluminum channels below the cabinets. This gives you some flexibility regarding color temperature, LED density (how many elements per foot), and CRI. Be sure to calculate the load (the tape light should indicate power per foot or similar) and get a power supply capable of driving it.\n\nI believe code requirements are fairly lenient with low voltage lines and that this should be fairly easy to do before drywall is up. But of course you should confirm this plan is legit with an electrician.",

      "selftext": "I have a typical American residential electrical panel for which I've installed interlock kit on a 30A double pole breaker. With a L14-30P inlet to use with my 240v generator.\n\nBut I also have a small 120v inverter generator. I want to be able to use it too instead of the larger 240v generator for when I just need to power led lights throughout the house and I want to save fuel and keep the noise down.\n\nI want to use the same generator inlet, and for that create an adapter 5-15P to L14-30R. That would go into my 120v generator.\n\nInside that adapter, I want to bond two hot wires XY. This would energize both legs of the panel.\n\nWhen using 120v generator, I would first disconnect all double pole breakers on all 240v circuits. Since I can't power them anyway.\n\nAlso, a have many MWBC circuits. It's an old house, so MWBCs are not on double pole breakers and are not strapped.\n\nSo theoretically, if I bond XY and connect my 120v generator, I could overload the neutral if two circuits that happen to share the same neutral end up getting loaded to the max.\n\nHowever, my 120v generator is rated for 2000W starting, 1700W running power. It has overload protection. So if any load in the panel, on either or both legs combined, pulls more than 15A, the generator protection kicks in. If generator's overload protection fails, then the generator engine would just bog down. It's not powerful enough.\n\nAll my breakers are 20A or more. And I think all neutrals are at least 12ga wiring. So no way can my 120v generator overload a neutral on any of the MWBC circuits when energizing both hot wires with the same phase.\n\nStill, I want to make sure I don't do something stupid and dangerous. Do you guys think I'm missing something or is this approach safe?",

Full disclosure, I work for another fixture manufacturer but we have looked at using their LEDs before and they just don't have good coloration in my opinion.

Frankly, all the tests and standards for lighting aren't optimized and don't measure LED performance well. One case is how lumens are actually measured against the spectrum that the eye if capable of seeing. This means you can theoretically pump up your \"green values\" to cheaply boost lumen levels (easier to do than boosting red due to phosphor issues). \n\nThere are also a lot of issues with color rendering measurements of LEDs that don't match up with how people actually see it. Specifically, R9 values (how good does red look under your light) often test low, but functionally there appears to be little or no difference. \n\nI think I just nerded out a bit...",

They have specialists for every project and will be able to answer your questions, and might even point you to a product that isn't available at the big box stores....\n\nWhich brings me to my next point. If you have a lighting supply company nearby, I would go to them. They are equipped with a range of inventory options, and more than likely have a few demo setups available.

      "selftext": "[Album of the Process and Progress](https://imgur.com/a/MXMgYgX)\n\nMy wife and I started a kitchen remodel back in the beginning of February. Our main goal was to improve the layout, which was very...lacking. There was plenty of opportunity for change, so this was our wishlist:\n\n* The oven was essentially standalone on the other side of the room, making cooking a juggling act. Move the oven and microwave next to a counter\n* Add in an island. With the small footprint of the kitchen, we knew the island wouldn't be large. However, we wanted some additional storage space that an island could give us in the center of the room.\n* Update the cabinetry. All of the cabinets were likely original from when the home was built 60+ years ago.\n* Quartz countertops with an undermount sink. The existing sink was undermount with wooden countertops, but not properly sealed. It was a magnet for mold along the edge.\n* New flooring to bring the whole thing together. Some of the tiles were cracked and chipped, so we definitely wanted to take care of that.\n\nWe did most of the work ourselves, except for the electrical, plumbing, and cabinet installation. We had to move the gas line for the stove, and get some dedicated circuits for the disposal and dishwasher to bring it all up to code.\n\n**Biggest Challenges/Takeaways**\n\nThis was the largest undertaking we've done, and we quickly felt like we were in over our heads. It only takes a week of doing dishes in wash basins to really appreciate having an operational sink in the kitchen. Here's what we learned:\n\n* Planning is key. We spent a lot of time upfront trying different layouts to see what would work best. You obviously only have enough space to work with, so we had to get creative. Luckily, my wife is a designer, so she came up with some really great options.\n* Stick to the plan. Sometimes you have to change plans halfway through based on unexpected things that pop up, and that's fine. But once you get going, keep the overall goal of the project in mind. For example, when the cabinets were going up, we originally didn't have the ones above the microwave going all the way to the wall; there was a small gap. But when they were put in, we put them against the wall. This led to a challenge with the microwave, because the walls weren't perfectly vertical.\n* YouTube is your friend. Seriously. I would spend some time doing research before I moved onto the next phase. Whether it's drywall, flooring, or anything in between, there are a bunch of resources out there to make sure that you're doing it right. And even then, you'll make mistakes.\n\n**Project Timeline and Cost**\n\nWe finished the project in June, and that was with some delays with the contractors and inspections. Overall, we did most of the work on the weekends, with some evening work mixed in. From start to finish, it took us somewhere in the ballpark of 4-5 months total. The real challenge is doing as much work as you can to limit the time your kitchen is out of commission. We had access to the stove nearly the entire time, but the sink is the real thing that you end up appreciating.\n\nTotal Cost of the project was around $20K. About half of that was for the plumbing, electrical, and cabinet installation, which is why I recommend doing as much as you can by yourself to cut down on costs.\n\nCabinets (Klearvue) - $4K\n\nCountertops (Quartz, Interstellar) - $3K\n\nSliding Door - $160\n\nFlooring (Expressa, Smoky Mountain Oak) - $700\n\nLighting (Island Pendant and Wall Sconce) - $160\n\nBacksplash (Mohawk Subway Tile) - $80\n\nFaucet - $100\n\nSink (Karran, Quartz) - $240\n\nStools - $60\n\nFridge (LG, 30\") - $1050\n\nThere are some miscellaneous costs too, like paint, the shelves, grout, etc. We took advantage of Menards' 11% rebate in such a way that our cabinets paid for our flooring, and our flooring paid for our backsplash.\n\nOverall, we're very happy with the final product and happy to have a functional kitchen again!",

I'd like to add LED undercabinet lighting to each section, and control each section with a discrete undercabinet switch that can turn each bank on and off, but also dim the lights.  \nmy goal would be to hard wire the lights using the outlet power that's in the wall just below the cabinets.  \n\n\nI'm hoping to find an inexpensive solution that's not ugly and very streamlined.  \nLights like: [https://store.waveformlighting.com/products/aluminum-channel-for-led-strip?variant=13656491917414](https://store.waveformlighting.com/products/aluminum-channel-for-led-strip?variant=13656491917414) with these or something similar: [https://store.waveformlighting.com/products/ultra-high-95-cri-led-strip-lights-for-home-residential](https://store.waveformlighting.com/products/ultra-high-95-cri-led-strip-lights-for-home-residential)\n\nAnd a switch that can be mounted hidden under the cabinet would be ideal.

I've installed hat channel suspended from the ceiling with Pliteq GenieClips with their L brackets so I can level and straighten the entire ceiling.\n\n  \nI'm also using the hat channel to mount my LED channels on so I can set the proper height for them to be in line with the drywall since the LED channels are 7/16\" tall.\n\n  \nThe problem I'm running into is when my 1/2\" drywall is butt up against the side of the LED channel I'm left with a gap as you can see here:\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/a5dbdetoi39c1.jpg?width=776&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8863e7c8dfc6fe9bb2dc2e02502f8cdc0a842e6b](https://preview.redd.it/a5dbdetoi39c1.jpg?width=776&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8863e7c8dfc6fe9bb2dc2e02502f8cdc0a842e6b)\n\nThis gap occurs because the LED strip isn't as wide as the bottom of the hat channel and the side of the hat channel is angled so the drywall makes contact with the side of the hat channel before reaching the LED strip.\n\n  \nSo a few questions I have:\n\n1. How would you handle butting the drywall against the LED channel? I was thinking about cutting a 45\\* angle on the sides that butt against the profile?\n2. Do I need to tape this joint or is mud enough?\n3.  Is this the correct approach or should I perhaps look at using 5/8 drywall and routing a channel in the drywall to recess the LED profiles into? I'm worried about only being left with 1/8 of sheet rock and it potentially cracking/stressing.\n\n  \nAny other insight into the best way to go about doing this would be greatly appreciated!",

Then, apply fiberglass mesh tape over the joint for a flexible and strong bond, followed by joint compound (mud) feathered out to blend the joint smoothly with the surrounding drywall—apply two to three coats, sanding between each for a smooth finish. Alternatively, you can use 5/8” drywall and route a channel to recess the LED profiles, but make sure the remaining drywall is properly supported to prevent cracking.",

Costco, HD, Lowes, Amazon to name a few and all have discounted multipacks.  Some are fixed temperature and some selectable, some dimmable, some not.  Find one that fits your budget and has the options you want.  They are all the same looking physically with minor differences and no one model is more pleasing looking than another in my opinion.  The more generic or standard, the easier it is to replace one down the road without having to replace them all to match.  I got a 24 pack of 3k dimmable 900 lumen wet rated from Amazon Commercial a couple years ago for $40.  Heck of a deal but they don't have them anymore.  HD and Lowes also have multimount square surface mount lights that fit into 5/6 cans if you want something other then the run of the mill recessed circle.  The general trend is moving towards surface mount canless and all new cool features and light designs are usually just for those now instead of lights for retrofitting cans.",

      "selftext": "We just bought a house that has these under cabinet lights that are a type of push in fixture (which I can’t find the name of the type of fixture) with halogen bulbs. To replace the amount of bulbs and broken fixtures, it'll be a few hundred dollars. I have access to the 12v transformer in our basement to fish wires if needed. But does anyone know of a way to upgrade these to something that is 1. LED's and 2. Able to use the existing wiring? I attached a video to show that one part of the lit cabinet is separated by a doorway. They ran 3 separate wires to each part of the cabinet to solve this. This is why I'm hoping to use the same wiring but can't find anything that allows me to retrofit with newer and frankly better options.\n\n\nLink to [video](https://imgur.com/gallery/gDily3z)",

LED strip lights usually come with a 6' wire attached, if the old wire isn't secured in the wall just use the old wire to pull in the new. Option 2 is splice the old to the new. You definitely want to change out the old transformer for a new LED driver. The transformer puts out 12 volt AC and all LED strips run on DC voltage.",

Is the future of 8inch rgb downlights looking bleak or am I one of those \"early adopters\" people keep talking about? In other words, are they on their way out or will the market be full of them in a few years?\n2. Instead of buying one of these two options I mentioned... am I better off hiring an electrician to close up the holes and replace the huge downlights with smaller spot light ones? I figure those would be a good alternative since they are way easier to find, specially the GU10 bulb ones.\n\nEDIT: The downlights in question are the retrofitted ultra slim variety ( the ones with the spring clamps).",

The most notable item inspection found was that the chimney was a bit crooked and would need to be fixed eventually.  \n\nProblems started from the moment I walked in. The first thing I saw was a small puddle on the living room floor. We just had our first rain. Uh oh. We determined it was the sky lights and tried to get a roofer out (took a couple weeks due to holiday). It was FREEZING and I was ok with no heater because I had this nice fireplace right? Nope! Tried to light a fire only to fill the house with smoke and set off the co alarms. Some researching led me to conclude that the fireplace had been set up for a wood stove and either I purchased that or retrofitted the fireplace entirely - this was thousands $$ and I’m house broke now so no-go. I settled on a $300 propane ventless fireplace insert for heat this year and fingers crossed it will work out. \n\nLiterally NONE of the appliance worked properly. Ok maybe the microwave did. But the gas stove was missing some parts so the propane guy couldn’t get it to work and he had no answer for the oven as it was electric. The disposal and dishwasher both fail to turn on. The water heater puts out the most tepid water. \n\nI tried screwing with the water heater only to discover they installed it with all the controls facing the wall so impossible to get to! So I went about emptying it halfway, which was just enough to be able to turn it a bit. Turning it the right way would’ve been too easy though. The electric cable going to the heater was too short to allow this so I had to turn it the opposite way which allowed me access, though not as comfortable as it could’ve been. Opened the controls up and saw the thermostats both set to under 100. Upped them to 120 and prayed. And that’s where I had my first bit of good tidings. Finally hot water!!! \n\nI go about my life fixing what I can waiting for the roof dude to show up. He finally does today, coincidentally the next big rain since the last time. He quickly ascertains that yes, it is the skylights and the workers I guess didn’t feel like finishing and didn’t seal or flash anything. I went up myself and I can lift the things up from the roof. He also said the chimney and pipes need re flashing. \n\nHere’s my big questions. The inspector- he was clearly on the roof- how did he miss this?? And is checking that the appliances at least TURN ON not part of inspections? How do contractors get away with work like this?? I swear it’s like they had a vandetta against this house or something. The owner never even stepped foot here so they took advantage obviously. It reminds me of the model homes I used to screw around in as a kid and they looked all nice and perfect but you go to sit on a bed and realize it’s made of cardboard and everything is for show and nothing really works. \n\nIs there any recourse in cases like this or do I just deal with the loss and call it a lesson?\n\nI called warranty and they are sending someone for the appliances but warned me that there’s a chance I’ll be denied due to preexisting conditions because I stated that I noticed the issues immediately upon moving in. Wtf? She did ask if it was noted on inspection and was surprised when I told her no that I did not think they checked. \n\nMy immediate concern is this. I do not have the $3k needed to repair the leaks. I am an avid diyer and from speaking with the roofer and looking at some videos, I feel pretty confident. I also have a house building buddy to call if needed. I could use any and all advice! I will be flashing the skylights and the chimney and pipe. The roofer said the skylights will need to be lifted a bit and have something inserted under them I think - that’s the only part I’m not totally certain on. I put plastic over the roof as a stop gap. Oh and while it was just a small puddle in the living room first rain, now it seems like it seeped through the ceiling in the bedroom and I will have to rip out the drywall there. See pics. \n\n\nHere are some photos and the list of everything wrong:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/SMR4Ymg",

I've also tried putting two 90 degree bends in the tension springs to widen them this also did not work.\n\nThe only thing I can think to do at this point is yank out the old work boxes, get some 8\" retrofit's and wire them into the ceiling.  They require a 8.125\" hole.  I am not thrilled with this idea, however now that I have the can out, I can see that the hole they cut is really too large for the can they put in, because there is a about a 1/4\" gap between the ring for the can and the drywall where cold/hot air just pours through.  Part of me thinks cutting a new 8\" hole and starting fresh might be best.\n\n\nAny ideas?",

      "selftext": "Built this built in entertainment center myself. https://imgur.com/a/Wb9XSYc\n\nI have very limited experience with woodworking, so wasn't 100% sure how this would turn out.\n\nI built the boxes using 3/4 mdf and used maple for the face frames. I wood filled the gaps so it all blended nicely after painting.\n\nOnce I installed it, I put govee smart led strips for nice backlighting or having a dance party for my kids.\n\nEDIT to add details:\nThese were pretty simple to build. The boxes and dividers were made using 2 4x8 sheets of 3/4in mdf. These were $40 a sheet. Everything was wood glued and tacked together using a brad nailer and Inch and half nails. \n\nThe edges of the mdf were very porous so I used a healthy amount of wood filler and sanding to ensure the finish would be smooth.\n\nFor the faceframe I got a sheet of maple for around $120. I cut and planed each piece and put them together with wood screws using a kreg jig. I also used wood glue for the joints.\n\nI lined up the cometed frame on the boxes, glued and clamped it in place. I then tacked the frame  in place and filled the nail holes and gap between frame and box with wood filler.\n\nAt this point I sanded the whole thing so everything blended and was smooth.\n\nI spray paint for a living and had access to the equipment and facilities to safely spray. The white primer, semi-gloss paint and clear came out around $120, I do have alot of all 3 left over so it probably is closer to 30-40 to spray.\n\nThe light strips are smart wifi strips from govee. I have a channel behind the faceframe that the strips are run through to hide them. I bought 3 strips at 22 a piece.\n\nThe total for the whole build once screws and nails are factored in is around 300. This is a heck of a lot cheaper than the 700+ for similar online.\n\nIn terms of challenges, I don't usually have to spray the interiors of cabinets. Most of what I spray is flat borders and surfaces. I had runs in my first coat of primer I had to sand out before spraying. I've been spraying paint for 8 years now so I made some small adjustments to how I sprayed the insides, pushing my arm all the way through and back to keep the paint from building up in this narrow space.\n\nEDIT: here's the picture with the backlights.  https://imgur.com/a/9aKfOu0",

      "selftext": "[https://imgur.com/a/6oKJxgR](https://imgur.com/a/6oKJxgR)\n\nI finally finished (except touch-up paint) my en-suite renovation.  The major goals were to make the space more usable and not so terrible looking .  The room is only 5' x 7' total and whoever made it originally, made it very poorly.  \n\nThe toilet was a full-sized elongated bowl, really big, and it was set so close to the back wall that you had to sit on an angle with your leg resting against the wall.  \n\nThe original shower was a typical 24\" coffin-sized unit only a few inches taller than me (I'm most of 6'2\").  \n\nThe biggest part of the project was of course, the shower.  I pulled out the little coffin and usurped all the space taken up by a linen closet (accessed from the bedroom) and a bulkhead with two heating ducts in it.  I re-routed the HVAC lines inside the big wall of the shower using 3.25 x 10\" rectangular ducting to fit between the studs and just tore out the linen closet.  That left a 61.5\" wide space with around 32\" depth to build the shower.  The ducts re-attach to the original lines going to two bedrooms in a bulkhead I built into the ceiling over the shower who's finished height ended up being around 85\".  \n\nI used cement board for the shower walls and used a full Schluter shower system - a pre-formed pan, curb, Kerdi membrane, and 2\" Kerdi board for the little bench.  I probably would have used Kerdi board but couldn't find any.  I also put Ditra under the floor tiles outside the shower.  There are also four Schluter stainless steel shelves in the shower in the same profile as the floor drain.  I really like how easily the shelves go in (they rest in the grout lines), how they match the floor grate, and that they saved me the hassle of tiling a niche.  \n\nI used Kerapoxy epoxy grout and just loved it.  The mixing and application was easy, cleanup was not difficult, and now we don't have to worry about all the problems with regular grout.  It was expensive, though - four little tubs at about $50 each - and much harder to find than standard grout.\n\nThe shower door is a Vigo Elan unit.  Some reviews complained about difficulty installing and understanding the instructions but I found it very smooth to install and am really impressed with how well it went for me and my wife.  My only problem during the installation was that the Mastercraft tile drilling bits (the 1/4\" braised diamond abrasive one) I tried to use kept breaking.  Two of them folded so I got a carbide bit instead.\n\nI moved the toilet flange about 5\" further from the back wall so you can sit comfortably on it.  Since the room is so small, I wanted the smallest toilet I could find but I didn't want a round bowl.  I was happy to run across the Deer Valley DV-1F52807 which is an elongated toilet but it has a really slim tank so it's only around 23\" deep.\n\nWe decided to turn the vanity so it is against the wall under the window.  That allowed for a 30\" vanity (the original was 24\").  I also put in an in-wall medicine cabinet which meant I had to re-run the drain vent around it.  Normally you would have a mirror over the vanity but all we have to do is open the medicine cabinet and the inside of door is mirrored so you can use it like in any other bathroom.  \n\nThe total budget was around $6000 Canadian (we're in Southern Ontario) and most of it went into the shower.  The shower door was $1600 or so, the Schluter products were at least a grand.  I put in good Panasonic fan, a humidity-sensing switch, and Moen shower valve.  I also put in slim LED puck lights including one in the shower.  \n\nThe biggest challenge was tiling the shower, but I really brought that on myself.  I should have read more on the difficulties of putting large tile on a wall.  It was just physically very difficult to get the big tiles set on the wall flat and even with each other - especially at heights where it is hard to get proper leverage to push like down low or overhead.  Chest-level was easy, the top and bottom were exhausting.  I did okay - some edges are a bit uneven but nothing is glaringly bad and at least the lines are straight.  \n\nI started near the end of October and just finished this weekend.  I could only really work weekends and got things up to the point where the toilet and vanity were in over the Christmas holiday.  Once I got to tiling the shower, I really slowed down just to take easy on myself.  I did the shower in several small stages - usually two rows at a time.  I lost more than a week at the end of December waiting for the epoxy grout to be delivered.  I certainly could have gotten things done quicker but we have another full bathroom in the house so I was able to take things slow.\n\nOver all we are really happy with the result.  The space has been optimized and we have a usable shower.",

A beam intersects the center of the ceiling, so a single light fixture doesn't seem feasible, and lamps aren't really cutting it.\n\nAny pro tips? The only real option I can think of is recessed lighting in the center of the \"squares\". If that's the best route, would it be best to place a light in each, or would a smaller number of them be sufficient? (it's a 4 x 3 \"grid\", so a maximum of 12 lights). \n\nThanks in advance for any input!",

The good news is that they worked wonderfully in the 4 ft long bedroom lights.   \n\nIn the 2 ft long living room lights, one of the starters crumbled when my hand hit it as I plugged in the LED light.  So when the lights came on and died quickly, we assumed it was bad starters, so I went and got new starters.  Long story short, we now know that LEDs don’t need starters.   And now the living room lights don’t work at all, even if we put in the old dying fluorescents, nothing happens at all.   We did check the breakers and they are not flipped.   I went to get dummy starters, but the small hardware store doesn’t have them.   What do we need to do to give my brother back lighting of some sort, hopefully for not much more money?  Thanks",

      "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nI'm planning adding recessed LED lights throughout the house, but there are two things that I can't quite figure out.\n\nWe live in Toronto in an old 1950s bungalow, so nothing is very up to date. While I want to update the lighting, I also want to properly follow code. \n\nThe first thing is that electrical code here requires cable be stapled to studs every 5 feet as well as 12 inches from the actual junction box. Drilling through a stud, or top/bottom plate and running cable through there is also considered a \"staple.\" I'm about 99% sure the current cables on the walls are not stapled properly. So if I were to add or replace any, in order to meet code requirements, would I effectively have to cut out a large portion of drywall to add the staples in?\n\nThen the second thing is that light switches have to be a minimum of 36 inches (3 feet) away from open water sources (sink, shower, tub). Our house is tiny and our bathroom is microscopic. The current light/fan switch is located inside and basically [right next to the sink.](https://imgur.com/a/y3nQ44n) This obviously wouldn't pass, so is my only option to move it to the outside wall?\n\nWhat I'm not sure about is how strict an inspector would on code compliance based on the age of the home. Perhaps there's no leniency at all, but I have no idea. So assuming worst case scenario (them being very strict), what are my options?\n\nThanks for your time and apologies for the long post.",

Installed the new outlet and noticed the green LED on the front of outlet went green then off but the dehumidifier worked and the outlet trips when I hit the test button so I just assumed it was a self-test or something.\nWhen I got a chance I plugged in a Klein outlet tester into the outlet and it showed 'no ground'. Took some measurements, hot to neutral - 120v, hot to ground - 70v, and neutral to ground - 48v.\nI just opened that 4-gang light switch it's fed from and 'visually' it's good and working fine (3 lights and a fan). Any ideas where I should check next? \n\n I disconnected the wires going to the outlet at the 4-gang and I get the same measurements but in the box I get proper voltage from the breaker to each bar, it's kind of a mess in there so I didn't look for the exact ground and neutral but will if that's the next step.",

You will probably need an EVSE (charger) that lets you set a 24A limit to match the capability of the circuit, but I think that's pretty common.\n\nI should probably add, you might want 50A if:\n\n* You need to charge two EVs off this one circuit\n* You plan to get something really inefficient like the Hummer EV (which might get around 2 miles per kWh compared to around 4 for a Tesla)\n* You have an unpredictable job not a regular commute.\n\nBut that said I wouldn't plan too far ahead. Things like Vehicle to Grid are coming, and it might require different wiring anyway. For example the F150 Lightning will offer a sort of vehicle to grid capability (basically just letting you use it as a backup generator for your house), but only with their special 80A charger which requires special installation. So I don't think it makes much sense to overbuild now just because you *might* get another EV in 5+ years.",

I replaced the switch and the same thing happened and it was a good name brand dimmer. Eventually I found that by swapping one of the bulbs for a different brand (also LED) it stopped. All I can think is that since I didn’t have a neutral at the switch (switch was rated for no neutral) something in the flow of power from the bulbs back to the switch was “pulsing” due to them all being the same and having the same configuration.

I had to cut a big hole in the ceiling just to get it out because it was original to the house and installed before sheetrock.\n\nMy new Broan fan with LED light has 2 options for installing, new build which looks pretty sturdy or retrofit build where you cut off the mounting tabs and install from inside the housing. I am inclined to mount retrofit style in case I have to replace it again but am concerned about it being less secure and vibrating. I am hoping the square hole size is a standard and will be available in the future, because I think by the time the special Broan only LED light burns out, the whole unit will have to be replaced.\n\nIs it best to install with rigid metal vent pipe or the flexible type? This is a 4-season area with a cold winter. Another thing is the vent flap is not very strong and I am considering adding a little weight to ensure it closes tight. Anyone ever try this?",

Unfortunately they are not standard recessed cans, they are 1980s 5\" Lightolier fixtures. The trims are painted into the cans and everything generally looks awful. I'm trying to figure out what the easiest way to put in some nice looking LED fixtures is, preferably keeping as much of the useful infrastructure as possible. Here are photos of the existing conditions (after I removed all the fallen debris from the 1895 plaster ceiling above this gyp ceiling). [https://imgur.com/a/O4KdlmD](https://imgur.com/a/O4KdlmD)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think my options are\n\na) buy new 5\" Lightolier cans and trims and find LED replacements that can nest into them and use the socket\n\nb) ditch all the Lightolier junk (which might mean leaving it in the ceiling?) and replace with something like the following, which unfortunately would require a lot of rewiring and might not fit the 5\" rough ins.

Here's what happened - hopefully this'll help someone else who's doing this.\n\nThe \"hot\" runs through a thermistor in these lights to protect against over heating which i'm sure was a problem when people were putting 75w incandescent flood light bulbs in these things. The wire from the thermistor was so brittle that when i raised the collar that holds the light socket it grabbed on the insulation and simply pulled it up exposing the bare wire.\n\nSo i checked the other 3 lights i have here and one other had the same thing happen but not as much, it only exposed about a 1/2.\" The other 2 were fine. Overall though it's a pretty cheaply assembled light and it's asking for problems as the metal collar is thin and sharp and is going to push on the wire no matter what you do with it.\n\nI couldn't find them locally and don't feel like screwing around all weekend trying to, so I ordered replacement sockets w/ thermistors and will replace them next week when the parts come. Amazon didn't have them either, or at least not the ones that would fit these cans. $20 shipped and i should be back in business sometime next week.",

It would seem a shame to lose your existing cabinet simply for the light!\n\nYou can always block out the gap behind a new, shallower light. It can be a piece of wood painted your wall color or, better, covered with a matching piece of stainless steel trim. You'll always see the line, but I promise you no one else will. \n\nThat's the match-it-to-make-it disappear option. The other way to go is to make the \"mismatch\" more prominent so that it looks intentional. This might be as simple as adding a bit of material \\*below\\* the new fixture so that it stands off the top of the cabinet. Visually this would read as \"cabinet with light on it\" rather than \"cabinet with a slightly too short light\". \n\nAlso, check back to IKEA; might they now have dimmable lights?",

      "selftext": "Hello! I'm looking for advice on closet light fixture options from someone with better knowledge of residential lighting than me. I have an 80\" wide closet with an off-center existing light overhead. Obviously I could have the J-box moved so it is centered, but are there options to get a centered light fixture while avoiding all that electrical/drywall/painting work?\n\nThere is also a duplex outlet inside the closet on the door header, so a plug-in fixture mounted on the wall above the door may be an option as well.  I'd prefer a linear fixture, and motion sensing would be a plus. Can anyone recommend a solution?\n\nDrawing to better show configuration: [https://imgur.com/a/wB9hWyM](https://imgur.com/a/wB9hWyM)\n\nBackground story - previously, the closet doors were off-center, and the ceiling light was centered on the doors. One side of the closet was pretty inaccessible. We demoed a portion of wall to open up the doorway and get full access to the closet, but now the light is off center. There was also an outlet on the wall being demoed, so we had it moved up above the opening and flipped to face into the closet. This was done a bit hastily without a plan for the lighting because we were having the floor replaced and needed to get the wall demo done.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nETA: this is the master bedroom clothes closet",

I didn't realize I can buy these [C-clips](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Sea-Gull-Lighting-Traverse-Retrofit-5-in-and-6-in-Recessed-Metallic-C-Clips-14610/204367868) to secure the long type of spring clamp to the can. My can doesn't have them, and the LEDs I bought didn't come with any.\n\n\n**tl;dr**: I have two crappy 5\" can lights, I am having trouble finding replacement trim for them, one is installed in a tiled ceiling, so expanding the holes to 6\" is possible but it's my last resort.\n\nI have two recessed lights in my house. They're [5\" cans](https://i.imgur.com/Iw42jmk.jpeg), with this [spring claw](https://i.imgur.com/5SjWv7p.jpeg) retainer mechanism, and trim/fixtures (? pardon my ignorance of the terminology) that apparently hang from the light bulb ([installed](https://i.imgur.com/BHLQuS4.jpeg), [interior](https://i.imgur.com/6BnzPwq.jpeg), [exterior](https://i.imgur.com/76QcGjY.jpeg)). No pic of this, but when I removed the first one, the metal housing was jammed onto the light bulb, so I couldn't just unscrew the bulb and then pull out the housing.\n\nI must be missing something, but as far as I can tell, the only way to remove the glass cover and metal trim housing is to pull down on it. This transfers force to the the light bulb, and if it's incandescent or CCFL, that means the force is on the glass part of the bulb. The spring claw grip is stronger than the glass. So, when one of these bulbs finally burned out, I broke the CCFL just trying to get it out.\n\nI would really prefer not to have to fight with my light fixture just to change the bulb, so I'm hoping to find some more modern hardware I can install that will be less of a hassle. The big box stores near me don't have 5\" LED trim. They have some that are supposedly 5\"/6\" with an adjustable mount, but those are too big. Amazon has some 5\" LED trim options, mostly with terrible reviews, or mislabeled sizes.\n\nI could widen the holes, replace the cans with 6\" ones, or just use slim LED lights. The problem with this is one of the lights is installed inside a \"shower room\" which is fully tiled, including the ceiling. I'm sure it's possible to cut a wider hole with an abrasive hole saw or something, but I'd like to avoid that if at all possible.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n- [album](https://imgur.com/a/bS7fWts)\n- [can product label](https://i.imgur.com/mLEEygF.jpeg)",

      "selftext": " \n\nHi all,\n\nI wanted to run a scenario by you folks in hopes to gain some outside prospective on a situation that I am currently dealing with.\n\nTL:DR\n\n1950s home that had some electrical work quoted to modernize it. Electrician opted to not do a pre-inspection, ran into issues with the homes ceiling/attic access, running wires through wall, duct work, not having the right tools, temperature of the attic, general frustration with the work and left the job 1 day over the estimated timeline not completing the already chopped down task list. Gave them more than half the deposit mid way through the work and they are asking for the remaining balance when only 6/16 tasks were even completed leaving several incomplete or postponed. What would you do in this situation and what do you recommend I do?\n\nFull Story\n\nBackground of the home, my house was built in the 1950s. I recently bought this home 4 years ago with my wife and discovered immediately the house needed some electrical updates. Most of the light sources in the house were non-existent or stemming from area lamps. Some rooms didn't even have overhead lighting to include our master bedroom and guest room. Assumptions could be made that whoever did the work on the additions previously wasn't very forward thinking and as a result any work on this home becomes a big project.\n\nI hired a master electrician, older gentleman, Husband/Wife company that we've employed in the past to do the following work on my home estimated at 3 days labor and $2250.00 including material. They stated they would bill on their day rate and did no pre inspection before quoting the work. We insisted that they take a look around the house/attic/basement to make sure they knew what to anticipate but they declined.\n\n16 Tasks\n\nGeneral\n\n• replace any remaining flip switches with white paddles switches (x9)\n\n• put cover on garage circuit breaker panel\n\nDen\n\n• add 2 recessed lights and convert switch to a dimmer\n\nOffice\n\n• add 2 recessed lights and new dimmer switch\n\n• add 1 light to closet\n\n• add 1 new 2 plug outlet\n\n• repair/replace 1 existing outlet\n\nKitchen\n\n• add 8 recessed lights to existing junction and convert switch to dimmer\n\n• add new switch to existing lighting to be controlled from a 3rd access point\n\nLiving Room\n\n• replace 3 existing pot lights with newly provided recessed LEDs and convert switches to dimmers\n\n• add 2 recessed lights to existing lighting/switching\n\n• add 1 recessed light with independent switch\n\n• convert a 2 plug outlet to a 4 plug outlet\n\n• add 1 new 2 plug outlet\n\n• move a switch located in the master bedroom that controls the attic light to an adjacent wall outside of the bedroom\n\n• run a C wire for a thermostat\n\nOk so I'm just going to start from the beginning from my point of view and hopefully it has some kind of cohesion to you the reader.\n\nBefore the work started, emails went back and forth about the cost and time. A final estimate was to be sent and received so that we could provide half the cost up front as a deposit before the work began. We never heard from them and had to reach out to them to request the final quote which they ultimately never sent.\n\nJune 9th, Day - 1 (4-5 hours total)\n\nThe first day the Electrician shows up an hour after the scheduled time with a helper (not an apprentice or journeyman) to assist with snaking cable and whatever else and begin casing the house. We provided them with all the recessed lighting for the tasks, provided an itemized list of what we had requested and stayed out of their way as they got to work. They spent some time preparing the recessed lighting and decided to start with the kitchen lighting first. After no exaggeration 2-3 hours of making 4 cut out holes in the ceiling it was expressed that they were running into difficulty because behind the drywall was another layer of material that was very hard to cut through with their hole saw. This material was later identified as homasote board (sound controlling board). This appeared to be installed under all of the ceiling drywall in the kitchen, likely to reduce noise from the air handler in the attic. They expressed that maybe they didn't have the right cut out tools. After all the hurdles for the day, he replaced 1-2 switches with paddle switches and called it a day stating they would have to get some different tools for cutting the holes and do some brain storming.\n\nJune 10th, Day - 2 (3 hours total)\n\nThe Electrician and help arrive on the scheduled time. The first 1-2 hours of the morning was spent attempting to drill out more cut outs from the kitchen with little to no effect. The idea of drilling down from the attic to make these recessed hole cut outs came up but was later stalled because in my attic I have decking or plywood down so you don't have easy access to the joist bays as well as duct work from the HVAC that runs all through my attic floor over key areas that would need recessed lighting or wiring installed. The electrician spent another hour drawing/sketching which boards and ducts he would need access to underneath and stated that he/helper didn't have the tools to remove the decking to gain access to the joist space. I stated that it was the middle of the work day for me but as soon as I have time I will go into the attic and start pulling nails and cutting through plywood in the 100+ degree attic to help them gain access since I had a hammer and a nail puller tool. Since the kitchen lighting was delayed again, he and the helper replaced the 3 existing pot lights with 3 newer LED recessed lights in the living room. He wired them and call it a day around 1pm stating that until the decking in the attic was removed there wasn't much more they could do for the day and that the \"Boss/wife\" told him to go on another job for the rest of the day since they were at a stopping point here. Before leaving I expressed that since the decking/ducts were posing such a challenge that we may have to postpone some of the work that we originally requested until the ducting is removed so that we weren't requesting any work that was too unreasonable or unrealistic/expensive. (We have a future project scheduled to replace the HVAC with ductless mini splits.)\n\nThat night, we get an email and a call from the \"Boss/wife\" giving us a bill for the work done so far and explains some of the challenges that the Electrician was facing and why things weren't moving along as expected. The bill was for $1470.00 thus far to include time elapsed and materials. I had expressed concern that we were getting billed at a rate that was not following the progress/timeline. When I was asked to explain I stated that given the challenges and expressed concerns/limitation of the Electrician and what we think we will have to remove from the list currently the only work that has been done was 4 cut holes in my kitchen ceiling with no lighting in them, 3 pot lights replaced with LEDs and 2 light switches replaced with paddles totaling $1470.00. I continued that they were certainly owed half of the original estimate in an effort to show good faith on our end and that I do believe work was done and should be compensated but maybe not at the original cost/ day rate projected since there seems to be a level of resistance to work on these tougher jobs. I stated there were a lot of hours clocked but not a lot to show for it in truth. She repeated that they were billing for 5 hours each day so far even though I had logged maybe 4 hours the first day and barely 3 hours the second to which she rebutted that they charge for travel time and that he calls her when he arrives and leaves. Needless to say the conversation didn't get us anywhere and we wrote the the check for the $1470.00 to show that we were being honest and genuine.\n\nJune 10th, Day - 3 (5-6 hours total)\n\nAfter spending 3-4 hours of my own time the day prior in the hot attic pulling 4 inch nails and using my circular saw to make a series of access points for the recessed lighting in the kitchen the Electrician and helper arrive on time and hit the ground running. They spend a majority of the day, 5-6 hours in the kitchen/attic cutting the rest of the recessed lighting holes, running wiring and installing dimmer switches. After a full day of working in the intense heat they called it a day and justifiably so given the temperature. The lighting in the kitchen looked amazing and we gave them much praise for their efforts. Before leaving we talked to him about what work we felt logically made sense to postpone due to the decking/duct work getting in the way of completing the tasks. We noted the following as tasks that would be completed at a later time and removed from the current tasking:\n\nDen\n\n• add 2 recessed lights and convert switch to a dimmer\n\nOffice\n\n• add 1 of recessed lights on new dimmer switch\n\n• add 1 light to closet\n\nKitchen\n\n• add new switch to existing lighting to be controlled from a 3rd access point\n\nLiving Room\n\n• add 2 recessed lights to existing lighting/switching\n\n• add 1 recessed light with independent switch\n\n• run a C wire for a thermostat\n\nJune 14th, Day - 4 (4-5 hours total)\n\nThe Electrician arrived a half hour after the scheduled time, we discussed his plan of attack on the remaining list and he began working in the office. He identified that decking and ductwork were blocking the location for the closet light and one of the recessed lights. We asked if he could just install one of the two recessed lights and add the second one on later to switch he said sure no problem (thumbs up.) After an hour or two or trying to snake a wire for the switch that would control the recessed light, he identified a crossed member in the wall preventing him from snaking the wire all the way through. He stated he would need a longer drill bit that he didn't have at the moment and would have to postpone that work. He continued with fixing a broken outlet in the office, expanded an outlet in the living room from 2 plug to 4 plug, installed the circuit breaker panel cover and finished swapping out all the remaining light switches with paddle switches. He then stated to my wife that he was frustrated and done for the day. We received a call later that day by the Boss stating that he left because he did all he could for the day and was frustrated with all of the challenges due to the decking and duct work. We stated that were was still stuff on the list that he said he could complete but had not done yet. She replied stating that if we wanted him to he could come back out maybe sometime later in the week if we really wanted those things done.\n\nSo that brings us to today, and email received for the remaining balance due of $825.00 after our initial deposit bringing the final total to $2295.00 stating that now the electrician knows the house somewhat we can get a price from him for the remainder of the work later down the road when the ducting gets removed.\n\nI asked and expected to pay for 16 tasks to be completed, identified hurdles along the way, removed 7 of the items on our list, and in the end still did not get the remaining work completed. From an overall view point, only 6 out of the original 16 items on the list were done and I'm being asked to pay more than was originally quoted.\n\nMy thoughts are that this whole thing has devolved into a shit show and given the facts, we were originally quoted for $2250.00 to do 16 tasks. I have experience as a handyman and do understand that costs, prices and timelines have to sometimes be fluid and I think hard work deserves fair compensation but in this situation I can't help but feel like I'm being billed for time spent on something that ultimately wasn't completed.\n\nPlease share with me your thoughts and feelings on the situation and thank you for taking the time to read this. Hopefully I didn't have too many spelling or grammar mistakes.",

          "body": "Im not sure where you're located, but the original quote sounds too good to be true. It's frustrating that they gave you a # and then proceeded to upcharge as things didn't go there way, but Im curious if there # was inline with the market to begin with? \n\nYou have every right to be frustrated b/c they didn't to their due diligence, but if they quoted $2200 for a $7000 job and are now asking for $2900, then it's still a great deal. If you received competitive quotes in the same ballpark but chose this company, then I would tell the boss/wife exactly that. In doing so, it levels the playing field a bit...otherwise they may be thinking (potentially correctly) that they ARE the cheap option and that even with the upcharge and lower SOW, you're getting a great deal. \n\nOne other item (as an electrical contractor); watching the clock is a dangerous game. Don't think of the hours they're at your house, but rather think of the hours your job is keeping them from doing other, paying work. At my job, I can 'start the clock' when my computer is turned on. For trades that require on-site work, I have to pay my staff to buy materials, drive to site, look over plans, stand and think about the job, etc, etc. I'm paying them for that, so I (personally) feel the customer should pay our company for it. Everytime someone complains about a bill and pulls out an Excel file of start/end times, I instinctively go back on my heels and prepare the \"someone has to pay for the work that's not, physically at your house\" speech. \n\nAgain- at the end of the day, it comes down to whether the price is fair.  You can absolutely point out that they are well above the agreed upon amount, but they probably have a VERY GOOD idea of how they stack up against their competitors....and if they ARE the cheap option and they know it, then you're probably not going to get anywhere arguing. If they're not, push back and don't pay. As long as you have a contract that shows the 16 items that should be done along with the price, then you would most likely win a small claims suit. If you don't have that, I would honestly just pay it and move on.",

          "body": "Hi there; long read but well detailed. Right off the bat seems like these guys got into something that was way over their capabilities. Not having the right tools means that they haven’t worked with that type of situation. \nSome contractors are great when they quote and work on brand new construction, but working on more complex jobs seems to frustrate them and justify their ‘now we have to charge you more because we don’t know wtf we are doing and we will probably have to hire someone ourselves to come do it and pay them or we probably have to buy new tools to work on your project.’ \n\nI’ve had this issue with some demolition guys who had never demolished concrete with rebar. Not surprisingly they wanted to charge more because it would take longer. Instead, i rented the industrial hammer drill myself and instructed them how to do it. Avoiding their extra cost. But I’m in Mexico and things work different here. No receipts, no contracts, no guarantees, just guys working for cash and beers. \n\nAnyway, I know things work differently in America. But if I was in your situation I would just make it clear to them that I am unsatisfied with their work and their competency to finish the job seems to be very low. I would just take my business elsewhere. Unless u signed a contract with them, what is there to worry about? You have a full right to call someone else to finish the job. \n\nNow, this is just my personal opinion but I really hate incompetent and overconfident contractors that say they will do this and that and then show up late. Being impuntual is the first red flag for me that these guys don’t care about the job and take no pride in precision and quality work. \n\nThat’s just my two cents\n\nGood luck, hope the job gets done and all turns out ok!",

I would not say well I can't do those things but the lesser things I can do will still take the same amount of time estimated +1 day even though you don't want me to do all of the more difficult tasks.  Am I saying that in a way that makes sense?\n\nAn exampled would be if I took my car in to have the engine rebuilt and was quoted $2000.  After a day or two of working on my engine the mechanic decides this is beyond me, or I don't like this brand of motor or whatever, but decides to change out the oil, spark plugs, air filter, should be still bill the car owner for the $2000 when the engine was not rebuilt but instead the clock was run past the estimate to arrive at the same dollar amount?\n\nI think this is a fair comparison but I could be wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for taking the time to read and respond.",

I also went to turn on the and off my air conditioning unit several times, and could not replicate the issue I am getting with the washing machine.  I am going to take an front panel off tomorrow and check the ground connections in the box, and check the actual outlet wiring to ensure there are no loose cables.  With only the washing machine causing the issue, I believe that indicates it has to be an issue with the circuit the washing machine is on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst post, so go easy on me.\n\nI have purchased a new construction home about five months ago that had an unfinished basement.  Working through small project in the basement I have attained an novice understanding of electrical work, but I cannot seem to explain or understand a problem I am having in the finished portion of my house.\n\nAll of the light fixtures in the house use LED bulbs, and even though they are each on circuits separate from my washing machine, every time the washing machine agitates, the lights dim slightly.  It is excessively annoying, although I must admit no one else in my household noticed the issue until I pointed it out to them.  I discussed the matter with the electrician, and was told that the issue was an unavoidable by product of mandated electrical boxes that sense ground-faults, and disable power in order to prevent a fire.  He told me the flickering I was observing is only seen in LED bulbs, and that I could either live with the flickering, or switch to traditional incandescent bulbs.\n\nThis answer seems a bit ridiculous to me, as I cannot find anything to support his statement online; however, I must concede that I also am not certain what to actually call it.  Most searches come back to issues with lights sharing a circuit with the washing machine, which as I stated, mine do not.  I did some references which suggested the problem was inconsistent, or dirty, power, but each of these sites were from manufacturers selling whole home power conditioners.\n\nI am outside of my knowledge set, and troubled that in a new home the electrical system does not seem to be able to handle the power draw from a new washing machine.  Is the electrician correct, or is this a symptom of poor electrical work or a poor power supply to my residence?",

I believe all three of them are dual T8 fluorescent 4' bulbs. \n\nSome of the bulbs are burned out, and at least one of the ballasts is making a humming sound. I'm leaning towards replacing them outright with new LED tube fixtures, rather than dropping in LED T8 bulbs. My assumption is that LED T8 bulbs won't fix the humming ballast issue, and it seems like it would be more reliable to have a dedicated LED fixture than a retrofit. The fixtures are just cheapo ones, they don't have a cover/diffuser, it's just a white sheet metal fixture with bare bulbs. So I don't really have an affinity for them.\n\nI had a two part question. \n\n1. Any recommendations for LED replacement fixtures? I was looking at some on Amazon that were like a 6 or 12 pack of individual tubes that all daisy-chain together and then the first one gets wired in. \n\n2. When I go to remove these, what should I expect? I want to have the new fixtures and supplies on hand before I take the old ones down. I assume they are screwed into the rafters, but what was the convention for the wiring? Should I expect to see a circular ceiling junction box being covered up by them, or just loose wires coming out of a hole in the ceiling?",

          "body": "Most T8 retrofit LED tubes require you to remove the ballast first anyway, bypassing it electrically. They essentially rip the guts out of the fluorescent fixture and just use the fluorescent pins as a basic 110V power supply just like any other light fixture. So they turn into normal light bulb sockets, and now you have a nice standard light socket where you can replace the bulbs with LEDs or any future technology. LEDs aren't forever contrary to popular belief, they do burn out or start flickering eventually as the power supply fails, and who knows what the future of lighting holds. I like keeping my options open, so I would recommend retrofitting your existing fixtures instead of replacing them with hardwired LEDs. That's just like... my opinion though.",

          "body": "> So you would install a type of can that allows you to swap in different pieces?\n\nYes, that's what I would do (and have done). Other really love the canless LED ones like you're asking about though - I think that's because this sub trends toward the easy DIY route rather than the more-difficult-but-better route. \n\n[Here's a link to the retrofit can you'd install from below](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Commercial-Electric-6-in-Aluminum-Remodel-IC-Recessed-Can-Light-Housing-6-Pack-CAT7ICRM/202057577), which just clips onto the ceiling drywall. Since you have attic access, you technically could install a new construction housing [like this](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Commercial-Electric-6-in-Aluminum-New-Construction-IC-Rated-Recessed-Can-Airtight-Housing-6-Pack-CAT7ICATA-6PK/202256649), though there's no real benefit aside from price. It will hypothetically be stronger fastened to the joists, but there's never going to be anything so heavy installed in it, so it doesn't make a difference. (Side note: the HD website doesn't seem to list single retrofit housings, but they're definitely in store)\n\nI actually have those switchable nightlight-ring lights in my den. It's a pretty slick effect, but a bit annoying to use since you have to toggle the lights to change modes. Discrete control would have been nice. Home Depot sells both a [retrofit version that would go in a can](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Commercial-Electric-6-in-Selectable-Integrated-LED-Recessed-Trim-Can-Light-with-Night-Light-Feature-5-CCT-670-Lumens-11-Watts-Dimmable-53804101/306080129), or [a canless model](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Commercial-Electric-6-in-Canless-Selectable-Integrated-LED-Recessed-Trim-with-Night-Light-Downlight-900-Lumens-Dimmable-53823101/311084487) (that's also brighter, for some reason), so that light alone wouldn't make your can vs canless decision for you...but when a can is $8.75 and the canless light is $10 more, you can both save money and gain future flexibility if you don't mind the install taking slightly longer.\n\nIf a quick history lesson would help put it in perspective, the recessed housings have a standard lightbulb base in them, and have been the standard way of doing recessed lights forever. It's only recently that the canless LEDs have come out that give you the option of paying more to have the light, housing, and junction box all in one product. Since they have to clip onto drywall, new construction houses will still be built with the standard cans/housings, so that format isn't going away any time soon.",

Here is my risk/benefit:\n\n1. **All LED:** These are usually very stylish, low profile, small hole, and work beautifully.  The risk is that 5-10 years from now when they start going out, you have to find the EXACT same brand of replacement driver or light which may not be available. If you go this route, don't cheap out and get a major brand like Nora, Juno, Lightolier, Cooper, etc.  The other bad part is that LED lighting is still improving so whatever thing comes out later, you won't benefit because you're stuck with that exact brand and model so you may have to replace them later.  \n2. **Traditional housing with LED trim**:  This is what most people do now because traditional housings are cheap and easy to install for electricians and the trims and lights are together so you save a little money by just buying one. The only bad thing there is again, in 5-10 years when they start going out (and they will despite how much they promise to last 20 years), you may not find the exact matching one - maybe the trim is a little wrong, maybe one light is slightly brighter than the other one or the color is a little different despite both being 3000K.  \n3. **Traditional Housing, Traditional trim, LED bulb:** I kind of like this option the best myself because replacing bulbs is easy later and your trims will stay the same.  If technology changes or you need something different, it's easy to do.  Really can't go wrong with 2 or 3.    ",

So not having torn up that opening, my guess is that they bolted the mount onto a joist and squeezed the wire through a hole that runs JUST to the side of the joist. That's my GUESS.  \n  \nIn terms of wiring, there is a master light switch that functions fine, but somehow there's a dimmer switch next to it that I can't confirm functions but my wife SWEARS that the previous fixture was dimmable.  \n  \nI bought [a basic $90 hunter overhead fan](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Hunter-Channing-52-in-Indoor-LED-Brushed-Nickel-Ceiling-Fan-with-Light-52074/300787130) (no remote available, sadly) and [a retrofit fan mount box w/ brace](https://www.homedepot.com/p/15-5-cu-in-Retrofit-Ceiling-Fan-Saf-T-Brace-0110000/204845572) to start.  \n  \nFrom here, my assumption is that I need to isolate/protect the wires while making the hole big enough for me to figure out what the actual situation is and then once I figure that out, carve out a hole large enough for the brace to fit and mount it as close to the edge of the joist as possible (so I'm not making more holes/patching than necessary) and then proceed as normal from there in terms of routing the wires into the box and then mounting the fan as you normally would.  \n  \nDoes that sound like a plan? Am I on the right track? Any must-have tools that I'm missing? I have a 3\" arbor/hole cutter bit but i don't have a drywall saw or anything like that.  \n  \nI'd love some input on how you think I should proceed. \n\nMore info: it’s located on ground floor of 2-story bungalow",

Reciprocating tools, and even manual hand sawing, often causes old plaster keys (where the plaster squeezes through the gaps in the lath and \"keys\" into it) to break. That's a bigger problem for ceilings than for wall because the keys are what holds the plaster up against the force of gravity. The up and down motion of hand sawing or reciprocating tools causes the lath to flex up and down. Something to be avoided, especially on old ceilings.    \nI've had a bit of success with small fiber-optic inspection cameras that you connect to your phone like [these](https://smile.amazon.com/iksee-Endoscope-Inspection-Megapixels-Smartphone/dp/B073XDY2M6).      \nIf you use a hole saw you might consider modifying a small plastic food tub with a hole to fit around the mandrel when you chuck it onto your drill. Cut the sides down so it's more like a shallow round tray and it'll catch most of the cutting chips.",

If these lights are daisychained and wired to other things downstream on the same circuit, make sure you’re not plugging anything to those plugs that are higher than 15 A. My wife did this and almost burnt our house down. One winter, the heater broke. She plugged in 4 radiant heaters to the same circuit. It was a 30 amp circuit, but ran through a light switch in the kitchen that was only rated at 15 A. Needless to say, the light switch melted and smoked behind the wall. The circuit never blew because it was a 30 amp circuit. I’m sure these lights are not rated for a very high amperage if they are LED. Just make sure there is nothing downstream on that same breaker circuit that could be drawing tons of power through them at a high amperage rate. That will definitely cause magic smoke. This is something to consider and just a thought also. Kill the circuit breaker for those lights, and see what else loses power. Everything from the lights and down away from the panel, is downstream on that circuit. Just checking to make sure it’s not a high amp load",

Whole process from day I ordered until install about 4 weeks. Marble was installed by some cool Romanian guys in about 75 minutes. They got the old granite out in one piece, impressive. New Blanco sink off Craigslist and Delta Leland Faucet. Last night I finished it with the e faucet, new garbage disposal and sink plumbing.  This ISE Evolution 3/4hp is pretty quiet and the way it mounts has very little vibration. Beats the 7yr old 1/3 Badger that was on there.\n\nWe had all the kitchen cabinets painted white before we moved in last month, and the gray paint was already in the main areas so we kept that. Overall looks really good and wife is happy with it. Threw in a USB receptacle behind the pull out trash can on the left side, so we can route usb charging cables for our phones to the \"junk drawer\". \n\nButcher block wood countertops are Ikea HAMMARP. Super scarce now, but saw some inventory hit in my local store, so we rushed out there and got 2 84\" pieces for $139 each. My neighbor is a skilled contractor and he and a friend put them on for me over a weekend. Still waiting to do the backsplash, have materials,need the time. \n\nRan electrical to the top of the cabinet- got the top light setup, and working on some LED strip lighting for under cabinet next.\n\nI think we'll add a dimmer switch to the recessed ceiling lights- which are some LED retrofits I added, also from Home Depot.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/Aiw4T\n\nI've been picking what to leave to a pro, and what to DIY.

I'd like to replace them with warmer recessed lighting.  I don't really want to redo the drop ceiling so I'm stuck with the grid that's there.  General rules say to place lights half the distance of the ceiling height.  So with my ceiling being at ~7ft that's every 3.5 feet.  With my room size though that seems like an awful lot of recessed lights.\n\n[Here's a rough layout of the room and what I'm thinking I have to do.](https://imgur.com/a/0FWM4YF)  The grey vertical bar is a steel beam that runs across the ceiling.  Does this make sense or can I do with fewer lights?\n\nBonus Question: Which LED lights should I use?\n\n* [The lights that fit](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Halo-RL-5-in-and-6-in-White-Integrated-LED-Recessed-Ceiling-Light-Retrofit-with-Selectable-Color-Temperature-2700K-5000K-RL56069S1EWHR/304533541) into [a recessed can](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Commercial-Electric-6-in-Aluminum-Recessed-IC-New-Construction-Airtight-Housing-6-Pack-CAT7ICATA-6PK/202256649)?\n* Or the [ultra thin lights](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01ND1L263/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_ep_dp_dPvKBbHJDK1BX) that can clip to the ceiling panel?\n\n",

It's the pain in the ass factor   Those stretchers are really made for rough-in of houses and in those cases it's easy to just nail them on and lock them in place.  With drop down ceilings, you'd have to cut a hole in the tile (which may be a pain depending on the material), put that in and go from above and  get self tapping screws to connect the stretchers to the edges of the frame. If you don't and just sit them on top, they'll twist around and you'll get one side of the can being higher than the other side and then your trim won't fit right.  \n\nIt's very rare for drop down ceilings to have residential Style recessed lights and the commercial recessed lights which are LED and usually larger, have places where you can slide in some EMT pipes that's it on top of the ceiling tile framing so they are easier to work with.  Even then, in some Office Buildings, we get called to remove those recessed lights and replace them with panel lights as they provide a much better quality of light. \n\nYour basement, your rules but from experience I would never put recessed lights on ceiling tiles myself. Panels are so much easier to just drop in and wire. If you need to work on other things in the ceiling in the future, you can just push them up and move them out of the way while you work and then put them back in which you can't easily do with recessed lights.

Not saying this one is bad but it might be better to get one or two and try them first.  \n\nJust a few notes:\n\nMake sure you get the color temperature you want.  Most offices are around 4000K but lights people use in their homes are warmer - 2700K or 3000K.  Personally I think 2700K LEDs look a little too yellow so I pick 3000K if it was me. \n\nMake sure the fixture you get has a built in junction box when you're doing drop down ceiling. It looks like the one you linked has that.   There are some that are designed for flat drywall and don't have a built in junction box and just have a short tail that comes out that would go in a ceiling junction box, if you get those, you're going to have to install your own junction box and your life becomes much harder. \n\nAlso remember that while these are dimmable, they require a 0-10 volt dimmer which requires that you daisy chain low voltage wire between them as well.  You can just buy a roll of 18-2 grey/purple or if they don't have it(rated for at least 120 volts even though it's low voltage so that way you can legally put them in the same box), just black and white and daisy chain them from fixture to fixture (zip tie it to your Romex or better yet, MC cable and drop down back to the box.  They also sell a special luminare MC cable that has a black/white/green line voltage as well as the purple and grey low voltage wire.  If you get that, you will be a pro. \n\nEven if you don't plan on dimming them now, daisy chain the low voltage wire in case you do in the future. Even if you don't drop down the LV to the switch or it's not possible, there are remote modules (like Lutron PowPak) that can do that...you can add a little pico switch or two and even have a remote control in your hands.

I THOUGHT ZigBee had come to the point where it was comparable with iOS. 😢 I miss my iphone!!  ZigBee let's see if I say it right: ZigBee has the most overarching and widest variations of controls for home or business at the moment. They blur the line between home and Mansion with DJ in residence. Also ZigBee appeared to act as a Master controller for sequential color schema in LED strip lighting though relays would be req'd at distance. This my understanding: Apple HAD! its own bulb now does not and appeared to have chosen Phillips as is cohort in controls. \n I have 30yrs swimming pool contracting and saw the earliest \"we can do it all\" from your desktop(🤣😂) systems that were not interoperable, causing JANDY Aqualink to go to an \"RS\" designation (being 'recognized standard 232) So!.   In the interest of pwng the whole enchilada best practices to me is go for ALL but when a niche is done better by others -- make way for the king! To me, is just better adulting to recognize the work of a (MUCH SMALLER SPECIALTY NICHE MANUFACTURER) competitor. It does however take a lot of whateveritis to share the limelight. But is such a very long term rewarding thing to do...\n\nI thought it was all in all and they had it all....w/o iOS it's a .500 ball game at the best from the outset.

Google retrofit can lights to see examples.\n\nIf you have the type fixed to the drywall, you might be able to remove it without attic access. The type fixed to the joist will need to be removed from above the ceiling through the attic or through the floor above. Or you can remove large amount of drywall to expose the legs on these cans and patch it up which is expensive. \n\nIf you have attic access, you can remove them there. If there’s a floor above and it’s carpeted, you might be able to peel back the carpet and do your renovations and put the carpet back. Wood and tiles will need to be removed and replaced so even more expensive.\n\nWith either option, you’ll need to patch up drywall. Unless you plan to install something else in the same holes. There are plenty of tutorials on patching up drywall and matching ceiling textures on youtube too",

The ideas that when the fire alarm sounds the floor mounted led strips lights up and leads to the free passageway with green, and shows red the other way. But apparently it's a brilliant idea or my googlefu are very bad.. So If any of you got a picture from a projekt you've worked on or seen, could you drop a link. I just need a good picture of a strait line floor mounted led strip in any color.     ",

      "selftext": "Hi!  Asking this on behalf of my electrician who is not absolute certain on how to proceed. \n\nI have a quite big 5V PSU unit (in fact 4 X 1500W with load sharing - 4X Mean Well RSP-1500-5V with current sharing)  which in turn feeds various lines (more than 60) that in turn feed power hungry  led strips (each strip is 50W per meter @ 5V). For added safety I wish to add between each line going to  the strips and the PSU a 20amps (for 5V) fuse (my concern is that if the  line shorts, then it would allow 1000 amps to go through the wire).  What is the easiest way to do that? I was thinking of in line fuses (you  put the in cable in one side, the out cable on the other side), but I  do not know where to buy them (neither does my electrician). I was also  thinking of a small fuse box, but again I do not know what the best  solution would be (space is limited in the closet and thus a normal electrical panel / fusebox - the 220v kind - should ideally be avoided).\n\nAs  a side question: many of these line feed the same led strip (i.e. a  feed every 100 cm). It is a smart addressable led strip. Would this  kind of arrangement (i.e. the fuses) be sufficient protection?\n\nAny help on the above would be greatly appreciated! :-) Many thanks!",

      "selftext": "Hello everyone. I just wanted to share my recent weekend project for the wife. I see most of the postings here are from pro-electricians, I’m just a handy guy that can strip wires and connect them together, so please go easy.\n\nWe turned a spare bedroom into an office so she could work from home. The room had no lights, not even power for a ceiling fan/light kit. We put a couple floor lamps in the room, but my wife told me the room did not have enough light compared to the office building she was working at and that her eyes were getting tired of looking at the monitors in the dimly lit room.\n\nI began planning what I would need and made a trip to my local Home Depot.\n\nThe job took me about 10 hours because I took plenty of breaks and because I was also trying to record everything. \n\n[Check out the video and tell me what you think](https://youtu.be/h6P8yYRIFmQ). I hope someone can find it useful.\n\n****Helpful tips I missed in the video:****\n1. Always flip the breaker off to the room you are working in. Wear proper safety equipment. \n2. If you are going to notch out studs like I did, remember to protect the wiring by putting a metal plate over them before covering them with drywall again. This will help to prevent someone from putting a nail through those cables.\n3. Double check your local codes and be sure to wire everything to spec and if the junction box has multiple taps for routing cable, be sure to use them, or wire up a bulk of cables in a separate junction box to avoid having so many cables tie into one.\n4. Use common sense. Electrical work is like math, there is one correct answer or in this case, one way things “should” be done and deviating away from normal practice could lead to you getting hurt or your property being damaged. \n\nDetails on the lights use: 4 pack of “Commercial Electric” brand. They are 6 inch LED lights with the option to change between 3000k, 4000k, and 5000k, which is the setting I’m using. They are 800 lumens each, drawing 12 watts per light. CRI rating is 90.",

If anyone could tell me what else I would need to know to do this it would be much appreciated. As well, any recommended products would also be a huge favor.\n\nThanks in advance for any help you lend!\n\nP.S I have undergone safety training in high voltage environments and someone who understands the dangers and precautions necessary to ensure proper safety and construction when building and wiring circuits (just not with a power grid application).",

      "selftext": "I'm setting up a small work room in my rental house. Because the wiring is old 2-prong, I installed a GFCI outlet to provide some measure of safety and allow me to plug three-prong devices in.\n\nOwing to the restricted amperage I have in the single outlet in this room, I chose a Lights of America LED shop light for the main light source. I have this attached to a power strip I can turn on and off with a hard switch to make it easier to turn off, and also for general bench use.\n\nOn the same outlet is a drill press with a basic single phase induction motor of the start capacitor type, with no run capacitor. The capacitor is basically dead, as I have to hand start it. (It came with the drill, I haven't gotten around to replacing it yet). It is controlled with a stand-mounted \"light switch\" style switch.\n\nHere's the issue: I notice that even when the light is switched off internally with the pull chain and externally at the power strip, the LEDs will continue to glow very faintly.  So long as it is physically plugged in at all, it'll be on, dim but operating.\n\nIn fact, the light never fully shuts off except in two cases:\n\n1. The induction motor is physically disconnected from the circuit by pulling its plug\n\n2. The drill press motor is running at full speed.\n\nThe GFCI outlet is supposed to not reset properly if there's a wiring fault before it, but it resets fine, and there's only the single pair that feeds it in the box, no additional pairs for other outlets. So the whole problem seems limited to what's in the room.\n\nThe power strip is just a Walmart special, so I'd bet it's just disconnecting the hot leg with the switch, not both.\n\nI know it's wasting power to leave it like this but mostly I'm concerned about it being a safety hazard.  \n\nWhere could the power be leaking through? And is this a sign of a dangerous situation with the induction motor?  How can I test and verify no other current paths exist?\n\nI can provide pics when I get home if there's something you'd need to see.\n\nThanks!",

          "body": "There's a possibility that there isn't really a problem. The motor is a highly inductive load, it'd be pushing/pulling current into the neutral slightly out-of-phase with mains voltage. \n\n\nSince the neutral wire has *some* resistance, the fact that current is flowing through it means that at any point between the motor (or anything else) and where the neutral is connected to earth/ground there will be some voltage. (Voltage equals current times resistance.) \n\nThe LED light would be fairly capacitive, so combined with the motor running you might get a *tiny* amount of current flowing back and forth into the light's capacitors from the neutral even with the live/active wire disconnected. Not enough to run the light or be a danger to anyone, but just enough to produce a faint glow. \n\n\nIt's things like this that are the reason why electricians often use test lamps instead of digital multimeters, because they're not fooled by this kind of thing. \n\n**Edit:** Just realised that you mentioned that this happens when the motors *aren't* running. It might be worthwhile checking the voltage between neutral and ground at the power strip. I don't know about the GFCIs you have over there, but over here they often don't trip unless there's at least around 30mA of current leaking. If your light is drawing less than that, the GFCI would still reset just fine even if there is a small leak to ground.",

I would also like to have one larger primary light source.  I currently just have a wall-mounted lamp with an on-off flicker switch built into the wire.  I was wondering if it were possible to tap into that wire, splice off the necessary wires to connect up two or three of these little LED strip lights.  The goal being that by using the on-off switch built-in to the wire, I could power the LEDs and primary lamp simultaneously.\n\nIs this possible?  I've done splicing of wires before, so I'm comfortable with the process.  I just don't know if the standard gauge wire of a standard lamp would be heavy enough to supply power to three other lights without becoming a safety hazard.\n\nAny help and tips would be very much appreciated!",

Typically I’d use a standard led driver with a 24v led strip but I’m concerned about 1) voltage drop and 2) overloading the dimmer.  Lutron makes a 250W LED dimmer but I believe you need to de-rate if in a multi gang box.  Haven’t had to run this many watts of LED strip lighting on a single switch before.  \n\nAny recommendations for either 120v tape lights or a setup I can run off a 0-10V dimmer?  \n\nThanks in advance!",

The uppers, unders and toe kicks against the kitchen wall dim perfectly, but the toe kick on the kitchen island does not dim, only turning on and off like a standard toggle. I find this strange because the toe kicks on the wall cabinets and thr island oprate off of the same slider dimmer (14/2 switchleg from the dimmer up to an outlet in the attic, and another 14/2 from the attic outlet down the kitchen wall, under the slab and up into the island where it terminates to another plug). The wires in the attic are tied through and pigtailed to the outlet. I tried reolacing the transformer, and using a new LED strip, no dice. Am I missing something here? ",

Commercial building: me and the journeyman were about a ohm out an unlabeled box above a grid ceiling. The journeyman was up on a ladder getting ready to strip the wire (not wearing gloves). He used his thumb to push off the insulation, and as soon as his thumb touched his strippers the connection was made. I don’t know if this guy kicked his ladder out intentionally, or if he’s just lucky. Either way, he fell hard off that ladder onto his back, taking a chunk of the grid down with him. He laid there for a bit moaning and groaning in pain while workers started pouring in.\n\nHe came to after a few minutes and our foreman drove him to the hospital. I saw him today and he was in rough shape. Ended up getting sent home out of concern. The job has been super tense ever since and we’ve had now three different safety meetings. \n\nKind of a crazy and eye opening experience I wanted to share. Stay safe out there!",

I didn't even know until **after** I began my electrical apprenticeship.\n\nMy issue isn't in distinguishing the colors **in general**, it is specifically when they are jumbled together.\n\nTo make it evident how little it affects me in day to day life: I discovered I was colorblind at the age of 20, while playing disk golf for the first time. I had bought a used, translucent red driver. For the first 5 or 6 holes, one of the members of the group I was playing with had to find the disk for me - even if I was standing no more than ten feet from it. At that point, he told me if he had to find it for me again, he was going to keep it. I noticed I had no issue finding his yellow disk, so I asked if he would consider trading it. I had no problems for the rest of our set.\n\nI went home and took one of those online colorblindness tests, and sure enough. I can't see those numbers worth a damn.\n\nSo, to answer your question: I just turned the head lamp on and looked at the color of the light haha. Had my colorblindness been more severe, I would have probably grabbed a spool of red wire (the label on the spool generally states what color it is) and taken it somewhere dark, flipped through the different settings, and memorized the order that the LEDs illuminate.",

Did you save the ballasts? If the strips were fluorescent replacement LEDs, you *can* use pretty much any 4-foot fluorescent ballast to drive them, but you won't get a lot of energy savings over conventional fluorescent lamps. Most LED fixtures actually use a device called a *driver* that looks very similar to a fluorescent ballast, but if you don't have either of those, all this is moot. LEDs strips require a specific power supply, and you'll fry them if you hook them up to 120vac.",

      "selftext": "I have an [\"open staircase\"](https://imgur.com/a/x6wxZXb) with 7 treads and I want to put led strips under each step's nose. I have routed a channel under each step and inserted an aluminum track that will house the strips. I also have wires running to each tread.  Based on my research so far the plan is to feed all the wires from the LED strips to a \"driver\" (power supply) and power the driver via standard 110. I want to make sure that I get the correct driver that will be able to handle all 7 of the stairs and to avoid any issues.  \n\n  These are [the light strips](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075L4M9BJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) I am looking at purchasing   \n\n  Per the info from their page each of the LED  \\~150mw each (0.165 watt). I calculated that each stair will have \\~63 LED \n\n  63 x 0.165 = 10.395 per stair\n\n  10.395 x 7 Stairs = \\~73WT for the whole set-up\n\n  I have [this driver](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06Y23JJZW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) laying around but its rated for 400wt. Is that overkill for my purposes? My concern is  with the fan noise on the driver. Its fairly loud and since I plan to keep it inside a wall in [an enclosure like this one](https://www.amazon.com/Q-EN1400-14Inch-Enclosure-ScrewOn/dp/B001BAYHX4/ref=sr_1_15_sspa?crid=1AHFZ54V0VVUZ&dchild=1&keywords=media+enclosure+box&qid=1595210262&s=hi&sprefix=media+en%2Ctools%2C228&sr=1-15-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzMEU0R1g2OE9aUTQ0JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUExMDQ0NTQ4M0haV1RJN1RKSDRSSiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNDc1MjQyMkg4MUoxWVNaU1ZSTSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX210ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=) I am also worried about possible overheating issues if there is no circulation. Is there any negatives to using a larger-than-necessary driver. Will it negatively impact the longevity of the strips or create other hazards? \n\n  If so, how big of a driver should I actually get for my set-up? Am I on the right track with this whole plan? Any other advice or possible concerns is greatly appreciated. Thank you all in advance.",

So far I was using 12V power supply with a cord, but now I'm looking for a solution to power it directly from wall wires (220V) like normal lights.\n\nThe problem is that I want to make electric stuff fit inside a lamp so when someone wants to install it, they would just need to connect the wires and be done. I'd be using from 50cm to 1m of strip depending on a lamp so 10W power supply is needed. I was looking for so long and the smallest 10W power supply would be 58x25mm [https://imgur.com/SdU0d45](https://imgur.com/SdU0d45)  which is like 2 times too big to fit in. Are there any smaller power supplies or is there any other way to make it work somehow the way I want it? \n\nI know there are 220V led strips that would do the work but unfortunately I couldn't find flexible ones which I need.\n\nIf there is no way to make it work with a 10W strip is there a way to make it happen with 4,8W strip, so 5W. I found a power supply 1-3W which is way smaller and would be great [https://imgur.com/QYP7RDu](https://imgur.com/QYP7RDu) but it's still 3W max which is to low.\n\nOr maybe using led strips isn't the right solution but I haven't found any other because I need a strip of light rather than a bulb.\n\nSorry if I'm messing up some terminology, I'm not a native speaker and I have little knowledge about electric stuff.",

I said B option because that is parallel wiring where as A was series wiring which is not code complaint for line voltage circuits. In the picture he wrote that the bulb responded perfectly in standard parallel wiring so I mentally ruled out a switch loop as to not confuse because it was ruled out already via the information given. I am aware that it is always something to consider, but respectfully have to say that a switch loop is not being used in this scenario. I continue to stand by my presented explanation, as well as I would like to state that while being an apprentice, I am perfectly capable of understanding basic line voltage circuity and other matters in the electrical field. Just because I have the title as someone in the process in learning, does not make my points any less valid.",

I bought a vinyl gutter, installed metallic foil tape on the inside and installed a LED strip in it. It is bright but not as bright as my original fish tank. My original fish tank came with a hood light that has 4 small LED panels with 3 integrated LED lights in each panel. They are small but they pack quite the punch and even work on my new fish tank but they only fit my old fish tank. I have tried about 3 different LED strips from Amazon but they do not brighten up the tank compared to the original LED hood. Is the the type of LED that I am buying? Because the LED strip hood I made has over 50 LEDs compared to the 12 LEDs on the main tank. Where can I get daylight bright LEDs from? \n\nHere is the original tank hood LED \n\nhttps://www.chewy.com/aqueon-led-15-column-replacement-hood/dp/206060?utm_source=google-product&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=12789772272&utm_content=Aqueon&utm_term=&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIgqbPjZjc9QIVygeICR1OaA0mEAQYBiABEgJHEvD_BwE\n\n\nOne of the few strips I got from Amazon\n https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FQDT1VV/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_i_NHVTAMVJ1QEHSDX7VNDG?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1",

The wiring from the transformer to the light strips would likely be 18 gauge or similar.\n\nWhat throws me a little is that if this is all pre-planned, then would a proper installation try to have the 120v->12v (or 24v) transformation done _before_ the switch? I have heard that many dimmers aren't well suited to dimming LED strips and while there are many products out there that can work around the issue (Magnitude transformers keep popping up), the fact that it needs to be worked around suggests that maybe there is a better way if _everything_ is new?\n\nAnd yeah, the ceiling LED lights are going to be installed in an aluminum track with a diffusion cover over it, with the goal of have as even a light source as possible. The shelf lights will either have the same or maybe even a dedicated \"under cabinet light set\" if I can find one that does custom lengths.",

It’s powered by 12 volts. And has a Bluetooth receiver to control the lights on my phone. \n\nThe problem right now is that the led strip is not displaying any REDS. It displays a yellowish color or a white color whenever red, pink, or purple is selected. I have tested the strip with a different non Bluetooth receiver and the tapes do display all the colors without an issue. \n\nAll the colors were originally displaying correctly. Until I started cutting the strip along the dashed line. I’m pretty sure the issue is with the Bluetooth led controller but I’m not sure if it’s a soldering issue or a board issue entirely. And not sure where to go from there. \n\n\nIdeally I want to cut up the 32 feet into 8 different pieces. They’d be paired up and connected with those white connectors. And then the 4 main ones  would be connected to a 4 way splitter. \n\nAny help would be amazing!\n\nHere’s some pictures!\nhttps://postimg.cc/gallery/LjF0bWG",

      "selftext": "Hi! I have a question about safe ambient temperatures for extension cords & power strips and hoping someone here answer it.\n\nMy apartment building is over 100 years old and has very oddly-placed outlets, so it seems like I'm going to have to run a lot of extension cords in my unit. The building uses steam heat, which I don't have in-unit control of. There are radiators in the corners of 2 of the rooms which heat the whole apartment. They look like [this](http://imgur.com/a/HwB5qLb). I'm wondering if it would be possible for me to run an extension cord behind a radiator along the baseboard without it overheating?\n\nI realize that cables have temperature ratings, but if I'm not mistaken, that's referring to the temperature of the wire itself inside the insulation, not ambient temperature. I'm not entirely sure how to account for ambient temps on top of the temperature of the wire itself.\n\nI stuck a thermometer in the corner under the radiator to measure the max temp and so far the max reading is 92°F/33°C. My gut tells me that if I use an outdoor-grade cable I should be fine since this is well within the ambient temps you'd expect if a cable is sitting in the sun on a warm day, but I wanted to check if this sounds right? \n\nFor context, I'm planning on running a 1875W cable (either extension cord or a power strip cord if I can find one long enough) for plugging in a lamp, phone chargers, and laptop chargers. I'd be clamping the cable it to the wall so it won't actually touch the radiator surface at all and won't be coiled.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Does it sound okay as a concept, as long as I choose the right cable? Thanks!!",

Does it sound okay as a concept\n\nI'm not a licensed electrician, so I can't comment on the legality of it, but I would not do this. Even if it \"meets spec\", you're using a temporary device in a semi-permanent manner, in a higher-risk area that is also blocked from normal visual inspection. Combine that with the fact that your radiator is 100-years-old and operates with pressurized water vapor, the entire premise just scares me.\n\nIf it was me, and I just absolutely couldn't get by with cable runners, I would look into surface-mount conduit to protect the cable and get it off the floor.",

I'm not sure what you mean by cable runners, but whatever solution I use would be only for a few years and I'd have to be able to put it back the way it was when I leave.\n\nI uploaded a more zoomed out view of the radiator [here](https://i.imgur.com/Tdxo7Vc.jpg). The wall outlet is behind the dresser and the final destination for the extended outlets is just to the right of me from this POV. My alternative idea, if going along the baseboards behind the radiator wasn't safe enough, was to clamp the cable to the door frame and go up, then to the right following the picture rail, turn at the corner, follow the other wall, and then drop down along one of the window frames, clamping it as I go. It's a lot messier and would mean I need to buy a very long power strip cable, so it wasn't my first choice, but it seems like it'd be pretty similar amount of effort to the conduit option. That corner is still going to be pretty hot even at the higher mounting height but you're right, I didn't think about the possibility of steam leaking, which is definitely pretty risky.\n\nThanks for the info!",

(Think of that as how wide the \"pipe\" is, and voltage as the amount of pressure pushing on the water flowing through the pipe.  The higher the pressure, or the wider the pipe, the more total power.)  Now, if you connect a 12V load that draws just a small amount of current, the power supply won't be affected.  It has more than enough available.  It doesn't FORCE surplus current anywhere.

I have a single transformer feeding each strip using 22ga wire in parallel. I plugged the transformer in, which lit up each strip, only to find that the last two LEDs of each strip won't light up. I noticed that on every strip, these last two LEDs are after what looks like a pair of solder points.  I have a spool of another 15ft of LEDs, and when I connect that spool to the transformer, the whole spool lights up, no problem. The transformer I have says it outputs 12V DC and 2 amps max. Now, even when I try to connect one of those 10\" LED strips directly to the transformer, the last two LEDs won't light up. \n\nWe tested each individual strip beforehand and they worked fine. Please, can someone tell me why this happened? Questions? \n\ntl;dr: have four shelves with 10\" LED strips in parallel, last two LEDs in each strip won't light up. Please help?",

(this would mean pulling up newly fitted carpet and finding a suitable access panel.) it’s easier to go through the floorboards than cutting the ceiling. \n\n2.) remove light and terminate existing cable or maybe leave the light in place (not ideal) then run psu from a plug socket and only turn on and off via wifi switch. \n\nWhat do you think is the best idea? Or can you see another route. \n\nWe currently have 2 switches that control the main light.

If not native 120V, a transformer pack that's quiet, runs cool, is easily hidden, and is expandable to a large degree. (e.g. a trunkline that can supply several strings in bays between joists.\n3. Standardized connectors that don't require me to get an exact I knife and soldering iron, but will likely be able to get parts for in the long run instead of scrapping the whole system and replacing. \n4.(bonus) Dimming ability, and color temp adjustment for different purposes.\n\nAny experience with different systems or suggestions greatly appreciated!",

The drivers aren't standard between fixtures.  Are they constant current or constant voltage?  What current?  What voltage?  For your strip light, none of the connectors are standard.  It's the wild west with every manufacturer in it for themselves, and many have folded or quit producing countless older styles.\n\nWhatever system you go with, if you want longevity, buy MANY replacement parts now.  Have a couple extra rolls of strip lighting for spares.  Get extra connectors, extra drivers and especially any fancy proprietary parts you can find.  Good luck!",

      "selftext": "I'm building a new home and in some rooms want to have led strip lights in tray and coffer ceilings, with led recessed and a fan.  I'm trying to find a creative way to get another switch with power to ceiling as builder isn't very flexible with add ons.  \n\nCould I ask them to do a 14/3 for the ceiling fan rough in (tell them I want to use a switch for light and a switch for fan).  I want to do a fan only not fan/light combo but would then have power in the ceiling with a switch capability to run led strip lights off of, power supply next to ceiling fan rough in or could just jump a 14/2 to corner of tray to place led power supply?\n\nBasically, would asking builder to do a 14/3 for ceiling fan rough give me the ability to have 2 switches 1 for fan (no fan/light) and steal the extra wire to jump to somewhere else in the ceiling and hook up led power supply for cove led strip lights.\n\nMark up on recessed light also seems fairly high for type I'm not a fan of.  Would it make sense to ask them for 1 recessed light to get the switch and at least wire started to ceiling so that afterwards its hopefully easier for electrician to just add 3 new ones of type I like and less holes in wall?",

I just wanted to make sure technically that jumping off an unused wire on ceiling fan rough in to hook up led power supply or other lighting seemed feasible.\n\nFor example I'm looking to add 32 led down lights. Builder chargers 225/light so 7200. If I at least had builder run one switch and 1 extra wire (14/3 instead of 14/2) with ceiling fan rough-in pre-drywall that's half the battle for later remodel install of actual led down lights. Would be closer to $1000 materials for those same number of lights plus labor so in theory substantially cheaper.\n\nNot sure if those additional lights would put to much load on the circuit or not.",

I had the driver inside one of the bottom cabinets , and ran 16/2 low voltage cable to the strip lights. Having a 120v line coming out under the cabinets isn't really the best option for led strip lights, as you need to put the driver somewhere unless your cabinets have a recess to hide it in. \n\nThey also make hardwire led undercabinet lights, which is easier, but possibly more expensive, depending on how many you need.",

I know after about 2-3 of them the LEDs become dim, and hot. I need a proper power solution that would allow me to hook up the 6-7 ones I need in one daisy chain. I do need a solution that doesn’t require me to use home wiring or deal much with actual electrical wires. Links to products/solutions are greatly appreciated!",

          "body": "Sorry - but I can't open the link via my phone at the moment. Still want to help. Feel free to PM me if you have any more questions!\n\nI'm very familiar with all of the \"standard\" LED strips, getting power to them, and supplying data (if required).\n\n\nFirst thing you need to do is figure out the wattage per LED.. Or per relative foot, meter, or whatever standard you want to install these by.\n\nTake that wattage, amd multiply it by however many LEDs, feet, meters (or whatever) you are planning to install.\n\n\nThat total wattage will tell you how big of a PSU you will need to get. At least, I like to run power from a breaker directly into a LED driver. They are relatively cheap on Amazon or eBay. \n\nPlan to get a PSU that can handle 20% wattage than your total wattage required for your LED strips. I get multiple drivers for multiple locations personally, but you can use one MASSIVE driver to supply power to all strips.. They will all just be on the same circuit too. Whatever floats your boat.\n\n\nOne big thing to note: each LED and wire length will add resistance in circuit.. So.. It is \"best\" to run power to every meter of \"neopixel\" style LED strips, and I believe every 4-5 meters of \"non-neopixel RGB strips.\nTest it with YOUR strips though. Resistance varies between makes and models.\n\nI recentally took all of my Neopixels out of my kitchen (post with description of neopixels on my reddit profile), and swapped them for \"static color\" 4,000 kelvin LED strips. I used threr 100watt drives to supply the proper power to each \"section\" of LED strips - to make them individually dimmable..\n \n1) Above Cabinet\n2) Under Cabinet\n3) Kick Plate (floor under cabinet)\n\nI could have saved money getting one 300watt driver, but I wanted individual control of each section.\n\n\nEdit: testing your strips...\n\nThe best way to test the strips you have is to set them all up in a series, and let every LED have the maximum values for each color.. So R@100%, G@100%, B@100%. Once you start seeing \"off white,\" you have too little current in the strip to support what you need. Cut the strips back, snd supply power to multiple sections.. If that makes sense.. As compared to one long run...",

      "selftext": "Hi, I’m wondering if anyone knows about surge protector strips and noise. I need a power strip in my apartment’s bedroom - old building without many outlets and they’re in weird spots. I’d prefer surge protectors as well because while i thin out what’s plugged in regularly, the wiring is old and sensitive to changes in power draw so I want to be careful. Turning on the oven causes the lights to periodically dim so I want to do my part to keep everything working and safe. A couple times the surge protector has shut down what’s plugged in presumably because something went wrong when I’ve had more than usual plugged in. \n\nThe thing is I have really sensitive hearing in the high ranges and every surge protecting strip I’ve had is loud enough to keep me up at night. I’ve mostly just sucked it up but I feel like I can’t be the only one with this issue and there has to be some way to address it. But I’m not techy as far as power supply so I wanted to ask folks who may have better ideas. \n\nThe building is early 1900s, I’m on the top (third) floor and I rent, so I can’t make any changes. I have access to the box in the basement for basic stuff. The outlet in my room is three prong, I don’t think GFI. Pretty old and yellowed plates and everything. \n\nI typically have my iPhone plugged in with a lightning cable, an LED lamp, a laptop, and a radio. Even with nothing plugged in it’s usually pretty loud. The sound goes away when I turn off the strips and unplug them so it’s definitely about the surge protectors. \n\nI can answer any more questions. Please let me know if you have advice to save my sanity or another place to ask.",

I have a lighting setup that I know could be simpler if I just went for custom LED strips but I just love the aesthetics of the product and how it works in my setup.\n\nI'm trying to light a bookshelf with figures on it, and I found these lights:\n\nhttp://m.ebay.com/itm/New-Fireworm-56-LED-Tube-Light-10W-USB-Powered-6000K-White-/322172366789\n\nThey are the perfect size and shape and when I 3d printed a bracket to hold it has the perfect shape and light distribution, and externally looks really good.  \n\nThe issue is that each of them is USB powered (10W - 5v 2a), and each of them has a switch with what I assume is a teeny tiny circuit board, because the switch is touch sensitive and if you tap it it's on/off, and if you hold it down it either brightens or dims (depending on the brightness).  It also remembers the dimness when on/off is tapped.\n\nMy question is: is it possible for me to string 8 USB micro b (I'm assuming ?? That it's just the voltage that's going through anyway) to one master controller somehow.  Ideally I would have one box with 8 outputs and I could control the dimness and on/off globally.\n\nHow could this be done?  Is it even feasible?\n\nAttached pictures of 1 of the lights in the setup:\nhttp://imgur.com/a/VJWqx\n\nEdit: the female and is a standard USB port.

It's an electronics project at that point.\n\nBe careful with those lights though, again, they are cheap chinese imports. I wouldn't bet on on the phosphors in all the LEDs aging similarly or even being the same to start. That will cause divergent color temperatures which will look like hot garbage. Also, the electronics and capacitors are going to be Chinese commodity bargain bin specials. What I'm trying to say is it's a lot of effort when you could use that effort for something that will likely have longer longevity and better quality. ",

      "selftext": "I'm setting up a small work room in my rental house. Because the wiring is old 2-prong, I installed a GFCI outlet to provide some measure of safety and allow me to plug three-prong devices in.\n\nOwing to the restricted amperage I have in the single outlet in this room, I chose a Lights of America LED shop light for the main light source. I have this attached to a power strip I can turn on and off with a hard switch to make it easier to turn off, and also for general bench use.\n\nOn the same outlet is a drill press with a basic single phase induction motor of the start capacitor type, with no run capacitor. The capacitor is basically dead, as I have to hand start it. (It came with the drill, I haven't gotten around to replacing it yet). It is controlled with a stand-mounted \"light switch\" style switch.\n\nHere's the issue: I notice that even when the light is switched off internally with the pull chain and externally at the power strip, the LEDs will continue to glow very faintly.  So long as it is physically plugged in at all, it'll be on, dim but operating.\n\nIn fact, the light never fully shuts off except in two cases:\n\n1. The induction motor is physically disconnected from the circuit by pulling its plug\n\n2. The drill press motor is running at full speed.\n\nThe GFCI outlet is supposed to not reset properly if there's a wiring fault before it, but it resets fine, and there's only the single pair that feeds it in the box, no additional pairs for other outlets. So the whole problem seems limited to what's in the room.\n\nThe power strip is just a Walmart special, so I'd bet it's just disconnecting the hot leg with the switch, not both.\n\nI know it's wasting power to leave it like this but mostly I'm concerned about it being a safety hazard.  \n\nWhere could the power be leaking through? And is this a sign of a dangerous situation with the induction motor?  How can I test and verify no other current paths exist?\n\nI can provide pics when I get home if there's something you'd need to see.\n\nThanks!",

          "body": "There's a possibility that there isn't really a problem. The motor is a highly inductive load, it'd be pushing/pulling current into the neutral slightly out-of-phase with mains voltage. \n\n\nSince the neutral wire has *some* resistance, the fact that current is flowing through it means that at any point between the motor (or anything else) and where the neutral is connected to earth/ground there will be some voltage. (Voltage equals current times resistance.) \n\nThe LED light would be fairly capacitive, so combined with the motor running you might get a *tiny* amount of current flowing back and forth into the light's capacitors from the neutral even with the live/active wire disconnected. Not enough to run the light or be a danger to anyone, but just enough to produce a faint glow. \n\n\nIt's things like this that are the reason why electricians often use test lamps instead of digital multimeters, because they're not fooled by this kind of thing. \n\n**Edit:** Just realised that you mentioned that this happens when the motors *aren't* running. It might be worthwhile checking the voltage between neutral and ground at the power strip. I don't know about the GFCIs you have over there, but over here they often don't trip unless there's at least around 30mA of current leaking. If your light is drawing less than that, the GFCI would still reset just fine even if there is a small leak to ground.",

      "selftext": "I have an [\"open staircase\"](https://imgur.com/a/x6wxZXb) with 7 treads and I want to put led strips under each step's nose. I have routed a channel under each step and inserted an aluminum track that will house the strips. I also have wires running to each tread.  Based on my research so far the plan is to feed all the wires from the LED strips to a \"driver\" (power supply) and power the driver via standard 110. I want to make sure that I get the correct driver that will be able to handle all 7 of the stairs and to avoid any issues.  \n\n  These are [the light strips](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075L4M9BJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) I am looking at purchasing   \n\n  Per the info from their page each of the LED  \\~150mw each (0.165 watt). I calculated that each stair will have \\~63 LED \n\n  63 x 0.165 = 10.395 per stair\n\n  10.395 x 7 Stairs = \\~73WT for the whole set-up\n\n  I have [this driver](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06Y23JJZW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) laying around but its rated for 400wt. Is that overkill for my purposes? My concern is  with the fan noise on the driver. Its fairly loud and since I plan to keep it inside a wall in [an enclosure like this one](https://www.amazon.com/Q-EN1400-14Inch-Enclosure-ScrewOn/dp/B001BAYHX4/ref=sr_1_15_sspa?crid=1AHFZ54V0VVUZ&dchild=1&keywords=media+enclosure+box&qid=1595210262&s=hi&sprefix=media+en%2Ctools%2C228&sr=1-15-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzMEU0R1g2OE9aUTQ0JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUExMDQ0NTQ4M0haV1RJN1RKSDRSSiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNDc1MjQyMkg4MUoxWVNaU1ZSTSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX210ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=) I am also worried about possible overheating issues if there is no circulation. Is there any negatives to using a larger-than-necessary driver. Will it negatively impact the longevity of the strips or create other hazards? \n\n  If so, how big of a driver should I actually get for my set-up? Am I on the right track with this whole plan? Any other advice or possible concerns is greatly appreciated. Thank you all in advance.",

In my experiments using my S9+ to view bulbs in pro camera mode, and playing with the 'shutter/appeture' settings, I found my standard 806lm colour bulbs that come with the starter kit strobe like crazy, however the pure white 1600lm bulb does not show any signs of flicker. I did think about replacing all my bulbs with the 1600lm white ones, but the downside is they don't dim down as low as the 806lm bulbs, they have a brighter minimum setting basically. Hope that helps someone. So I'm still searching for smart, dimmable (via app) flicker free solutions, if anyone can recommend something please do, they don't need to be super bright or rgb, but dimmable to a good level is most important. I know there's some non-smart eyecare type ones from Philips and those look great but I'd like smart if possible.",

I originally had a dimmer switch and noticed this, and thought that may have been the problem, so I replaced it with a non dimmable switch with a neutral wire:\n\nhttps://www.homedepot.com/p/Lutron-Caseta-Wireless-Smart-Lighting-Switch-for-All-Bulb-Types-or-Fans-White-PD-5ANS-WH-R/305090201\n\nUnfortunately that didn’t change anything.\n\nI understand that this means that there is still some amount of leakage across the switch — and that is necessary to power the switches own electronics — but I thought that the change would resolve the issue.\n\nIt didn’t. I’ve done some reading here and elsewhere, but what I cannot determine is whether this is an unsafe configuration.\n\nediting to say: thanks in advance for any input you may have.",

The ELV dimmers also need a neutral for ELV loads and as such have a lower minimum load requirement also.  Might want to re-read the instructions.  With thing other than light bulbs, they often need an ELV dimmer or sometimes 0-10 volt dimmers.~~\n\n~~I actually have to go deal with this tomorrow for a gentleman who bought what he thought were \"dimmable\" outdoor fixtures for a Caseta system I installed and programmed for him but now they don't turn off.  He said they would work normally if there was an incandescent fixture still on the system.  I did some digging around and it turned out the dimmable part is ELV.

It’s powered by 12 volts. And has a Bluetooth receiver to control the lights on my phone. \n\nThe problem right now is that the led strip is not displaying any REDS. It displays a yellowish color or a white color whenever red, pink, or purple is selected. I have tested the strip with a different non Bluetooth receiver and the tapes do display all the colors without an issue. \n\nAll the colors were originally displaying correctly. Until I started cutting the strip along the dashed line. I’m pretty sure the issue is with the Bluetooth led controller but I’m not sure if it’s a soldering issue or a board issue entirely. And not sure where to go from there. \n\n\nIdeally I want to cut up the 32 feet into 8 different pieces. They’d be paired up and connected with those white connectors. And then the 4 main ones  would be connected to a 4 way splitter. \n\nAny help would be amazing!\n\nHere’s some pictures!\nhttps://postimg.cc/gallery/LjF0bWG",

Designed to be wired into 120V system and switches or dimmers if supported (no plug w/ inline  click-wheel balogna)\n2. If not native 120V, a transformer pack that's quiet, runs cool, is easily hidden, and is expandable to a large degree. (e.g. a trunkline that can supply several strings in bays between joists.\n3. Standardized connectors that don't require me to get an exact I knife and soldering iron, but will likely be able to get parts for in the long run instead of scrapping the whole system and replacing. \n4.(bonus) Dimming ability, and color temp adjustment for different purposes.\n\nAny experience with different systems or suggestions greatly appreciated!",

With fluorescent fixtures, you carried a handful of ballasts, and the lamps were 2', 4', 8', etc.  But LEDs aren't like that.\n\nThe chips aren't standard between fixtures.  The drivers aren't standard between fixtures.  Are they constant current or constant voltage?  What current?  What voltage?  For your strip light, none of the connectors are standard.  It's the wild west with every manufacturer in it for themselves, and many have folded or quit producing countless older styles.\n\nWhatever system you go with, if you want longevity, buy MANY replacement parts now.  Have a couple extra rolls of strip lighting for spares.  Get extra connectors, extra drivers and especially any fancy proprietary parts you can find.  Good luck!",

      "selftext": "So I have been having some issues with the [lights in my kitchen](https://imgur.com/a/zDxPQSa). I had some 4k [Sunco](https://www.suncolighting.com/collections/led-bulbs/products/br40?variant=31968478822467)'s and they started to dim and flicker after about a week. They would constantly switch between some being on/off dimming and flickering when the switch was on. I thought it could be bad wiring but every light socket is getting stable power. It's a normal switch, not a dimmer switch. I then thought they where overheating since they are LEDs turns out 3 of the 6 lights got damaged from overheating or being cheap (I don't know good bulb brands besides Philips). So I then decided to try some different bulbs. So far these [LUNO](https://www.amazon.com/LUNO-Non-Dimmable-Equivalent-Neutral-Certified/dp/B07GQLJCX9/ref=pd_lpo_60_t_0/133-0814570-5756466?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07GQLJCX9&pd_rd_r=e4a7d04b-2d29-47d0-a093-0b70683ae78b&pd_rd_w=mrJPI&pd_rd_wg=SOjIA&pf_rd_p=7b36d496-f366-4631-94d3-61b87b52511b&pf_rd_r=GGHJCMFCH3BDC02GW62B&psc=1&refRID=GGHJCMFCH3BDC02GW62B)'s are working ok but this [generic bulb](https://www.energystar.gov/productfinder/product/certified-light-bulbs/details/2317735) instantly started dimming and flickering.

I recently installed some LED bulbs [Sylvania LED Dimmable bulbs](https://www.amazon.com/Sylvania-Home-Lighting-78038-Equivalent/dp/B06XDCDZ63/ref=sr_1_1?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1519144719&sr=1-1&keywords=sylvania+dimmable+led+bulbs) in my house (3 of them in a single fixture). I also installed a [GE Smart Dimmer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MUCZA1C/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) to control the fixture. The standard switch got a GE Add on paddle switch. \n\n\n\nThe bulbs will buzz, audibly, at any brightness setting other than 100% brightness. Any idea why this is happening? I have tried the Sylvania bulbs mentioned above as well as standard CFL bulbs. The Slyvania bulbs are on the comparability chart for that dimmer, but not the EXACT model. Could it be a poor connection in my wiring?\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nOriginal fixture was on an analogy 3 way dimmer. Dimmer was in one receptacle and a regular switch in the other receptacle. The wiring was option 3 on this [diagram](https://www.easy-do-it-yourself-home-improvements.com/3-way-switch-wiring-diagram.html).\n\n\nBecause the dimmer and add on switches require constant power to function, I tapped into a neutrals from adjacent receptacles for both the add on switch and the dimmer. \n\n\nBONUS QUESTION: If the all wires in a receptacle are grounded to the work box, is it code to still ground each switch/outlet?\n\n\nCheers!\n\n\n",

They invented the dimmer and have a lot engineers working on LED lighting and even they can't get it perfect because there are so many different types of LED.  I don't know about all the newcomers but you're always taking a gamble with them when it comes to LED.\n\nSpeaking of Lutron, 4 years ago, I bought some Satco bulbs for a customer who had a previous generation Homeworks system with panels and RPMs (Remote Power Modules).  A week later, the module stopped working but I was never sure whether it was the bulbs or coincidence.  The tech support guy said that the bulb I had wasn't tested so there was no warranty but when I wrote the company, they said that model was similar enough to one they had tested so it shouldn't have been it and they sent a replacement RPM.  I was very surprised but then things got even weirder because I got included in the emails that Lutron and light bulb company were sending following up on the case so even though i don't know any details, I found out that they really take LED lighting seriously.",

Her home office doesn’t have overhead lighting, and we’re blocking the windows for webcam purposes, but now we need to add more light. I’m planning to install crown moulding with led strip lights, but I’m stuck in planning. \n\nWhat I know: i need 52 feet of strip, which is 4ish 16 foot strips. So I need to get a power supply that matches the volts of the led strips and has wattage of 1 strip multiplied by four. Anything I’m missing?\n\nFor general install, I was planning on mounting the power supply on the wall behind a bookshelf so it will be hidden, then running power from there inside the wall up to the leds. What do I need to connect the power supply to the strips near the ceiling?\n\nWhere I’m stuck: I’d like the lights to be dimmable. I’ve seen dimmable power supplies and dimmable leds. Do both need to be dimmable? If I want to dim? And where does the dimming come from? Is it manual at the power supply, do power supplies have remotes? I haven’t been able to find anything. \n\nLast one (for now). I’ve read about connecting power to both end of the led strip to mitigate power loss and help with color accuracy. If I need to do that since it’s a longer run, do I need to get a power supply with 2 leads, or can I run both ends to a single lead?\n\nI appreciate your help and knowledge. Thanks!",

The LED cans were on a Lutron LED dimmer, which it’s my intent to reuse with the strip. In my phots this dimmer is swapped for a standard single pole switch for troubleshooting purposes. I have the wall switch run to a MeanWell PWM-40-24 power supply, which I purchased along with the lights from SBL after calculating the wattage needed based on the length of the run. \n\nUnfortunately, I’m not sure what I have hooked up wrong, but I’m unable to get the strip to light up. Hoping somebody can shed some light on my issue (get it?).\n\nPhotos:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/POmebft",

      "selftext": "I've got an 120v 66ft LED strip plugged into an outlet controlled by two switches in my small workshop. The sub-panel was installed professionally, then I installed the 12g line, 20a receptacle*, 15a 3-way switches (not lighted), and 15a breaker myself. When the switches are off, I can spot sections of the LEDs glowing very, very faintly. Turning off the breaker kills this faint glow. With the LEDs plugged in, the multi-meter shows 122v when powered, and 7.5v when the wall switch is off. [Edit: With the Receptacle Tester plugged in, it reads 2.5v when switched off.] When I plug the LED strip into another circuit (single switch, 20a), it operates as expected (~120v on, 0v off). \n\nThe 15a circuit shares an outlet with a 20a circuit. The ground wires are all pigtailed to the ground screw. All ground wires read continuity. That's kosher, right? \n(Thats 4 ground wires in the wirenut: 1 to the outlet's ground screw, 1 to a 20a light switch, and 1 to each 15a 3-way switch.)\n\nThe 3-way switches appear to toggle correctly. Being a pretty rudimentary circuit, I doubt there is a compatibility issue between the LEDs and the 3-ways.\n(Originally, I installed lighted 3-way switches, but those were LED-incompatible and left an obvious heavy glow in the LEDs when switched off. Today's glow is very, very faint and splotchy by comparison.)\n\nAll outlets read healthy with a basic Receptacle Tester. (I don't think there is a 7.5v draw when the switch is off if the LEDs are unplugged.)\n\nCan anybody recommend some basic diagnostic steps I can attempt?\n\n\n*Why the mix of 15/20a? Original plan was to have 20a everything in case there was any piggybacking, but ended up keeping the lights on a dedicated breaker to avoid sudden blackouts. Since it's dedicated, and 20a 3-ways have limited selection, I downgraded to 15a for later/replaced components.\n\n[Edit: All switches and receptacles are Hubbell brand]\n\n[Edit] Update: Replacing both switches with Eatons has not resolved the issue, however, it did reduce the measured leak from 7.5v to 5.5v.",

Next step I'll try is to replace the other switch and see if that eliminates the leak.\n\nWith the Receptacle Tester, the leak was 2.5v instead of 7.5v with the LEDs plugged in. Now, with the new switch, the Tester has dropped to 0v, no leak anymore, but the LEDs are still reading 5.5v when off.\n\nI'll be surprised if both my Hubbell switches are bad, and I'm beginning to think there is a problem outside the switches, like in my connections or something. Which would explain the change in the leak. I guess I can try reinstalling the Hubbells, and see if it goes back to 7.5v leak.\n\nIs there anything else I can check, assuming switches aren't the problem?",

Perhaps I was wrong.\n\nI wanted to build a very simple under-cabinet LED light to grow some countertop herbs.  I built the light and was stoked that it worked; however, after two weeks of run time, the lights are significantly dimmer, putting out a yellow rather than pure white color closer to the power source, and emitting a quiet buzzing noise (like in older fluorescent fixtures).  \n\nThis is what I did:\n\n* I purchased a 5m strip of 6540 LEDs ([these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FFWQEPW/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1)) which came with the appropriate 12V/5A adapter.  \n* I cut the strips into 6 segments at the cut points and attached them to an insulated plywood backing.  Due to the length of the board vs. the length of the cut points, ~8 total LED lights were omitted from the project.\n* I soldered the strips back together using 18-gauge wire.  This was my first soldering project and I had a bit of trouble, but did do some practice beforehand on scraps.  I am positive I didn't cross any leads (all + went to + and all - to -).\n\nThe light worked great for a while and looked just as bright as before I cut it up and soldered it.  Now it's dim, humming, and some of the LEDs are noticeably yellow.\n\nWhat did I do wrong, and how can I fix it?\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "selftext": "Has anybody had issues of in-rush current when using MR-16 LED lights in MR-16 fixtures?  I have an issue with a particular lighting system (not Lutron) I used a few years ago that has a dimming module that can handle a 20 amp circuit and 3 outputs.  If I wanted to, and capped the other 2 outputs, one of those outputs can handle 1920Watts (16 amps) so it's pretty heavy duty.  \n\nFor magnetic loads however, they max out at half of that or around 1000 watts per the manufactuer because inductive loads have an inrush current and in the past when they didn't have the 1000 watt limit, there were a bunch of issues with breakers tripping and/or the fuse in the dimming module burning out.   I found that out the hard way 15 years ago when MLV loads were all the rage and every cove in every custom home had a bunch of 5 watt ambiance lights that were a bear to put on a dimming system without a bunch of boosters but I digress.\n\nIn this particular house in the kitchen, there are around 15 MR-16 recessed lights divided up in two switches  and we changed them from 50 watt halogens to 7 watt LED bulbs and apparently it has tripped up the arc fault breaker or the fuse in the dimming module.  I haven't been there in a year and I think they use another electrical contractor (who wired the house) to replace bulbs and add fixtures and such so it's quite possible that they legitimately shorted something out; however, even before that, I had an issue of that particular circuit tripping the breaker so I'm wondering whether the combination of a LED and MLV  combines to really screw with the in-rush current or not.   I don't think the entire Eaton 20 amp arc fault breaker has 3 amps on it.  \n\n&#x200B;",

      "selftext": "I am looking for a dimmer switch where I would plug it into the wall and the dimmer would be at that end, that I can plus an extension cord into, then up the side corner of a nearby wall to the ceiling. At that end, It will have (they're already there, actually,) two incandescent bistro style globe light strings running around the ceiling of the perimeter of the room. \n\n\nI can try to draw a cruddy picture, but imagine it plugs into a regular 3 prong wall socket; then has a dimmer switch either there, or within a short tail with or without a power strip oe transformer of sorts (ok for dimmer to be there) where I would them plug an (indoor) plain extension cord up the wall. There it  has two strands of lights, both male ends plugged into the extension cord, that are ultimately controlled by the switch here on the ground or nearby table, so I don't have to go climbing up to the ceiling corner where the strings are plugged in just to dim them. \n\n\n\nI've seen a few programmable or wireless ones that I think do far more than I want, cost twenty times more, and I am uncertain if they do what I do want them to. I really just want a dimmer.  The issue is the light strands that run around the ceiling are just a bit too bright, and being the third set now I have spent a whole day stapling hooks and whatnot and doing math to assure the swag is even all around the room, I am now standing on the couch unplugging one or the other to dim the room (and it's still too bright.) I love the final looks but they really are too bright. A dimmer somewhere early from the floor outlet would be perfect.  \n\n\nIdeally, I would find a small box with a 4-6 foot tail from the wall with a female outlet with rheostat where I could plug a simple extension cord, then the two strands run off there. If this doesn't exist, a basic dimmer that I plug into socket where I would plug the extension cord that runs up to the corner of the wall where the strands come out would be fine. \n\n\nEverything that I find seems to have the dimmer at the terminal end which is 7' up a wall; I'd like it to be either at the socket or on the table right above it. \n\n\nThink of the box I am looking for as being the same as a light timer that would come on and off, but acts as a dimmer switch rather than a timer; that might make a bit more sense. I apologize I am doing a poor job explaining this, but I got frustrated after about a dozen search terms on amazon didn't produce what I am looking for, but 200$ systems or dimmers I'm not sure why anyone would want the placement of, when I am quite sure something like this must exist for between 10- 20 bucks at most. \n\n\nI throw myself at the mercy of you people who know the names of things. It's worth noting these are two, 25 bulb 25 foot strings of mini globes meant for indoor or outdoor use that are used indoors, and I will be hopefully not need to use more than a simple 9' 2-outlet indoor extension cord to run from this elusive dimmer box of which each strand will run from one of the 2 outlets. Right now I have a very heavy duty cord making the trip up the wall, and dim them by unplugging one strand, which just looks silly and not really getting the effect I hope for. I'd like to make the room dimmer or fully bright as the situation calls for with all 50 bulbs lit (the perimeter is 52\" and the gap perfectly hides behind a clock. I just need to figure out how to make it less bright. When the space heater kicks on, it dims the lights, so it seems to me I must be able to create a system I do this on purpose. \n\n\n\nThanks in advance for any help.  Links to amazon items would be amazing, but even the names for what I want would be a huge help. I apologize for my poor explanation... I just can't seem to accurately describe it nor find keywords that pull up results. I have certainly seen similar items, so I am sure they exist. \n\n\nThanks so much in advance, and I apologize for being so, erhm, dim about how this works. It seems simple in my mind; I just fail miserably at describing it.",

Once more all fine. \n\nThen after tiling, issues. \n\n  \nIt's got the ohm's as before, but it's tripping out the RCB. \n\n  \nI tried a larger breaker for a test and an immediate trip, I tried even more and this time it ran for a minute but then tripped. \n\nSo what  did was put a power supply on it and ran a test with an LED plugging one end into the live and the neutral connected directly to the LED. It lit up the LED strip. So where or what next? \n\n  \nAny ideas or thoughts welcome as it's odd. Especially as it was running before without tripping and it still lights up the LED strip so it's not 100% broken. It's a fibre-stranded underfloor loose cable. ",

I have been shocked a decent amount of times and usually I don’t worry at all but this one just felt different. \n\nI wasn’t paying close attention to what I was doing and in the midst of stripping a live wire I believe I managed to touch one hand to my strippers and the other hand on something conductive, maybe the ground. Of course it happened so fast that I couldn’t remember. I looked away for a second when it occurred. I felt the shock and immediately pulled both hands off. The issue is I felt it thru both of my arms when only one was touching the actual live wire, leading me to believe that it had traveled thru me in a way possibly passing my heart. It was just standard 120V basement circuit. \n\nI haven’t had any real symptoms of anything I don’t think. But I’ve been anxious as hell about it the past day and now I can’t tell with the anxiety if I have symptoms or not. I don’t have insurance and I didn’t tell my boss when it happened because I was nervous.",

Some of the lights \"it always starts with the light furthest from the switch and works its way  back\" will be dim even on full brightness. It started with two lights in the back so I changed them out and they have been fine since. But shortlwy after the other switch leg did the same thing now three of those are dim. Occasionally they will come back on fully bright. My uncle who does residential told me to try the mastero pro dimmer because it uses a neutral.

Also, you might want to consider trying a different manufacturer dimmer if you’re still having issues with the Luton one.

      "selftext": "I have an el cheapo Chinese multimeter, but it's really good, IMHO... autoranging from 0.00 ohms to 60 Mega-ohms.\n\nI primarily work with temporary lighting and alarms... but my coworkers are always jankin' on my Chinese multimeter, tho...  even tho they have way more issues than I do.  I usually work alone, and 90% of what I do is checking for continuity and shorts across all conductors in a circuit.\n\nFor example, there was one circuit with maybe 5 LED flood lights and 12/3 jumpers between them.  The feeder and at least one end of EACH jumper on this circuit had a short to ground from someone *seriously* over tightening the BX connectors.  Was only ~ 300k ohms between ground and other conductors, which blew my mind, because I couldn't *see* any copper when stripping the jacket back an inch or two to analyze the cable.\n\nWhen I tried explaining this concept to my co-workers, tho, they had no clue what I was talking about.  They believe that a multimeter's resistance function ONLY has two states -- beeping for continuity and no beep means no continuity. They do know how a Simpson meter works, which I've explained is just the analog version of my digital meter, which they refuse to believe. They think that a Simpson meter is the ONLY way to check for shorts.\n\nAnd when discussing the matter further, I explained that my multimeter is really closer to a Megger than they realize.... just that my multimeter only uses very low voltage, while a Megger can choose different input voltages.\n\nCurious if ANY of my understandings are off-base??\n\nFor the simpletons at my work, I think 0 to 50 ohms will beep, denoting continuity, and measuring shorts with that same \"beep - no beep\" setting will never really show shorts, meaning they WILL have to use a Simpson meter if they can't actually measure resistance.\n\nOne of my ultimate questions, however, is at what resistance would you consider a conductor to have continuity (I'd say 0 to 4 ohms is ideal, and 50 is way too high)??\n\nAnd what resistance would you actually consider two different conductors to have a short (I'd say anything less than 3 Mega-ohms is a short, and a common recommendation of 800k being acceptable is too low).  But what say YOU?!?\n\nOn the same train of thought, what is the technical distinction between a dead short and an active short.  Can a short, measuring 300k ohms, always be considered dead or active?\n\nAlso curious if a Simpson meter or Megger can REALLY do a whole lot more than an autoranging ohmmeter that goes up to 60 Mega-ohms...",

You should still be testing with a megger cos you wanting to be testing the cable insulation.\n\nWith what resistance a cable can have before it's an issue that depends on length/size and the relevant earth fault loop impedance if it's a power circuit.

Picture a bunch of pulses in both the positive and negative direction within 1 cycle of a sine wave. The time spent at 0V per cycle is increased, which results in a lesser average voltage. \n\nBecause these drivers require some sort of signal (probably an analog signal in this case) to output a corresponding average voltage to the load, they will be incompatible with a standard resistive 120V dimmer. \n\nIf I were you, I’d keep the PWM driver (to either sell or use depending on what kind of work you do) and replace them with a standard dimmable driver.",

They were really concerned since they were going out of town for Christmas and the wife was the only one home. \n\nSo I show up to the house and the wife explains the issue. She said when shuts the light off from one of the 3 way switches it flashes really fast as it dims down. It's an LED wafer light so I assumed it was a bad driver or connection. I had her turn the light off while I watched it. \n\nInstantly I figured out her issue. From her perspective when she used that switch to turn the light off she was looking through the ceiling fan blades, making it look like the light was flashing as the blades were turning. \n\nShe was very embarrassed about the situation. I didn't charge her and told her it was a Christmas gift. She was the first customer I've had that refused to let me leave until she paid me something.",

Each LED Strip is ~60” long and there’s approximately 35-40 treads spanning all 3 floors. They’re all wired in parallel over 4 separate low voltage cables. These are all fed on a single 12V 200W transformer located in a closet on the first floor. 2 of the parallel feeds are relatively close to the transformer and aren’t an issue, however at the farthest splice point, i’m only getting ~9.4VDC to the light. Enough to power the light, but it’s noticeably dimmer than the other steps due to voltage drop.\n\nI have two questions\n\n1) I always forget how to calculate voltage drop, but i’m assuming i just take the 9.4VDC and divide it by the source voltage of 12VDC giving me 22% VD?\n\n2) To combat the voltage drop, In theory, could I swap the 12V transformer with a 24V transformer and create a voltage divider circuit using resistors to lower the voltage to 15VDC so that by the time the voltage reaches the load it will be the correct 12V?",

I took readings before it’s running and I get about 243V leg to leg. When it’s running voltage drops to 230V. Could this drop be causing her issue? She has 0 dimmers in her house but could those cans be seeing the voltage drop as a “dim” command like a phase dimmers would?",

The 150A doesn't include any other equipment that may be operating, either. \n\nElectrical networks are designed to operate within certain constraints and those constraints come from more than just the breaker/fuse. The size of the transformer also comes into play and if it's also serving more homes than just your friends this sort of hit may impact them. May. As the system is suddenly loaded when this heater is running the hight current will pull down the voltage on the rest of the network supplied by the transformer. This will also increase the current being used on all loads. This can cause breakers to trip within this network.",

She wants dimmable LED strips (tape) above and below her cabinets.\n\nI say, \"sure\", and purchase [THIS TAPE]( http://www.amazon.com/HitLights-White-SMD3528-Light-Strip/dp/B005GL5R56/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1424713230&sr=8-4&keywords=led+strip+hitlights+kit) and [THIS SUPPLY](http://www.amazon.com/HitLights-Listed-Watt-Power-Supply/dp/B007ME2HMQ/ref=pd_bxgy_MI_img_y).\n\nI then proceed to hook it all up to a standard wall mounted  120v LED dimmer switch (Leviton) wired to the receptacle and of course, it lights up, but doesn't dim.  Enter my gf's impassive expression.  First, I don't perform in the bedroom, and now, I don't perform in the kitchen.  Unless I can straighted this LED thing out, my days are numbered.\n\nShe insists on dimmable LEDs.  After further research, I suspect my purchase is not dimmable in the fashion intended.  She doesn't want in-line dimmers, she wants the standard 120v wall mounted dimmer.  Decora style.\n\nIs the LED tape I purchase dimmable?  Can you suggest an LED system that is?  Do I have to go to incandescent?\n\np.s. I'm putting up with all of her current disappointment and hoping to make things right because she is **way** out of my league and totally hot.\n\n[[ EDIT ]] [I need to figure this out.

      "selftext": "Taking to Reddit because we’ve had our two different electricians and the power company out twice. \n\nOur house experiences from what I gather are brownouts. It happens more frequently when more appliances are used at once but sometimes it will happen with 2 lights on an only the TV on. Sometimes the cable will go out 15 times in a night. \n\nThe refrigerator makes like a buzzing sound at times, the washer and dryer will just stop running (no lights on machine) and then you hear the power cycle up and it will just turn back on right where it left off. You can hear when different things are plugged in them like going lower voltage / downshifting in power and then they will rev back up. Lights will dim for a a minute or two and then sometimes stay super bright for a minute or two.\n\nOur Hvac has been worked on multiple times - latest issue was low voltage fuse blown inside unit (had a completely new system put in 8 months ago and the igniter went bad 2 months later\n\nEdit to add it is a townhouse connected to one other townhouse and the other house also has similar electrical issues \n\nAny ideas ?\n\nUpdate 5/14: guys from a power company came and changed out the light across that street and changed the daylight sensor. I have noticed the street light is brighter than other lights on the street and sometimes our electrical fluctuations correlate with that street light turning off and on. Seems like smaller fixes to bide more time but 🤷‍♀️\n\n5/16: Question for you all: when you work on a house’s electric you have to call the power company first to let them know? \nDoes the power company do anything to the power? Is there some sort of reset button or something? I’m thinking of how with cars you can clear codes for a few hundred miles or whatever - is there something similar with electric? When they come out the house has zero issues, it stays that way for a day or so and then back to flickering, long moments of dimmed lights and then bright lights, cable losing connection etc\n\nFINAL Update (hopefully!) \nSomeone competent came out from the power company, ran the super beast, our neutral was stripped so he rigged it to bypass a neutral? Anyways that still didn’t fix it so - went to the transformer box and our transformer was completely melted and burnt. Replaced! Hopefully our electrical woes are over -\nThank you so much to everyone who commented - and thanks Bernie from Delmarva- you’re the MVP",

It may help if your electrician is the one to make the call. It might take coordination with both of them to fix it. It's possible it is a connection that is the responsibility of your building but the electrician can't access it without the electric company disconnecting power first.\n\nIt really sounds like a burned up lug to me. It could be on the transformer or in the meterbase. It could also be a bad wire between the meterbase and transformer, I've seen it with underground services where a wire had a nick in it and burned up. Your description sounds like a connection heating up and losing connection once the load increases past a certain point. It will likely get worse over time and eventually lose connection altogether.",

      "selftext": "I recently moved into a new apartment, new to me and new construction, and I noticed that simply turning my Main PC on in the master bedroom would result in the lights dimming. At first I really thought nothing of this and dismissed it. However recently I connected two additional PCs in the same room and connected those to a UPS. I soon discovered that at times simply turning on my Main PC would result in the voltage dipping so low (below 110v) to the other two PCs that the UPS was turning on to supplement the power.\n\nAt this point my attention was peaked so I did some investigating and found the following... First I will say I am not an electrician, but have seen issues like this in the past working with server rooms that had voltage issues. Using my kill-a-watt meter and information from my UPS, which I know is not 100% accurate, but should be in the ball park at least. I was able to determine that my desktop PC (currently as a I type this) is pulling about 218 watts. While the two PCs that are connected to the UPS are pulling around 150 watts. Between the two devices around 368 watts total and nothing else in the room is powered on other than a couple of lights using LED bulbs. With those devices running the UPS is showing a voltage of 116 volts and the kill-a-watt meter is showing 116 volts as well.\n\nSimply turning off my Main PC and two other PCs that are connected to the UPS results in the voltage at the UPS and kill-a-watt meter increasing from 116 volts to 118.5 volts. Powering the devices back on again results in the voltage dropping off to 116 volts. My understanding is that this is within the acceptable range of 114 to 126 volts for a standard outlet in the US. However it does strike me as a steep voltage drop for such low power consumption...\n\nWant to turn on the vacuum? Forget about it... With my Main PC and two other desktops powered on turning the vacuum on in the master bedroom will trigger the UPS to cut on almost every time. With the voltage dropping from 116 down to 108 volts for the room. Now I understand that a vacuum pulls a lot of power, but I have never had this issue before, not to this degree. I have also never seen just simply turning my Main PC on dim the lights in a room.\n\nIt is worth noting that on a few occasions over the last few days simply powering my Main PC on results in the voltage dropping to levels that requires the UPS to activate. This is much more rare, but nonetheless it has happened.\n\nIt is also worth nothing that the same voltage drops when testing with the vacuum in other areas of the apartment are NOT seen. The other rooms in the apartment appear to not have this issue.\n\nOf course I became concerned about all of this and brought it to the attention of the maintenance team here at the apartment complex and they completely dismissed my concerns. The head maintenance person made it clear that he was a certified electrician and that this was normal and acceptable. Stating that 116 volts is within specification and that turning on the vacuum is going to result in a loss of voltage. I asked him to explain why the voltage in the other rooms does not drop off to which he said this room is the longest distance from the circuit breaker panel and that its normal.\n\nMy hope was that the maintenance team would at least check the voltage at the breaker, do some load testing, check for lose connections.. something anything really. However he simply connected a volt meter to one outlet and dismissed my concerns.\n\nAre my concerns valid? Or is this normal? What should I do?\n\nThanks!\n\nNote:\n\n* The UPS and my Main PC are connected to two separate outlets, but both outlets are connected to the same circuit. Really everything in the master bedroom is on the same circuit.\n* The voltage drop occurs at all outlets in the master bedroom, but not at other outlets within the apartment.\n* The master bedroom is connected to a 15 amp circuit.\n\n\\------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate 12/2:\n\nI spoke with the property manager for the apartment complex who has indicated that they have reached out to the local electric company to have the service to the building checked. Once this is completed, which should be in the next day or so, assuming that no issue is found by the electric company the property manager has agreed to reach out to the contractors that installed the wiring in the building, due to it being new construction.\n\nIn the mean time I have already contacted my own electrician and have them on standby to check the circuit if the apartment complex does not resolve the issue to my satisfaction.\n\nI will post more details as I have them since some of you seemed interested in this...\n\n\\------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate 12/4:\n\nThe electric company came out and determined that service to the meter is fine and they are not seeing any issues. This really comes as no surprise... The property manager has reached out to the electrical company (contractors) that were used during the construction process and is waiting for a call back from them.  \n\nAs a side note I reached out to two local electricians... One said that they would come out and take a look and the other said that unless the building owner or property manager came on site that they want no part in it. Mostly citing that if there are issues that they could than possible have a liability risk in the future... ",

If I apply a load to the CPU/GPU the issue becomes much worse. For example current testing shows 570 watts  with the voltage dropping all the way down to 112.7 volts. I have never seen this kind of voltage drop off from my PC before... this is certainly not normal. From testing I have done with other appliances the issue seems to get dramatically worse as the wattage load increases.",

I talked with the property manager this afternoon and she indicated that she would reach out to the local power company and the contractors that were used for the electrical wiring.

      "selftext": "First of all I am NOT a DIY-er. I'm a licensed electrician who runs lighting control on a few jobs and have been in the trade for about a decade now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd like to build a portable-ish test kit to show apprentices and journey people how 0-10v systems work and how to field program  lighting control devices (this one will be using a Lutron QSN-4T16-S). Something where I can set it up on a table and give them a run-down on how the systems work. A little bench with 4 unique fixtures that I can show them scenes, zones, dimming controls, QS linking and all that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnly issue I'm having is sourcing fixtures. I don't need anything too fancy, just needs to be 4 difference fixtures that are: \n\nLED\n\n 0-10v controlled\n\nand preferably compact\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know this seems like a very novice question for someone who just said he knows lighting. But my company does rather high end spaces where the lights are either customer provided, or someone in my office handles the ordering. Also because of the nature of our work, spare fixtures are not something my shop can just give away, as they are typically sold for much more than they are really worth. They have given me a small budget of around $300 for fixtures, but thats about how much wiggle room that I have. (they are providing all of the lutron nodes and accessories)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo any help as to where I can source some of these fixtures would be appreciated. Websites, search terms, anything that can help me find what I'm looking for.",

(If you saw me say it was 3 inches in my previous post, I was guessing - I've since measured it and it's closer to 6). In the attached picture, two of the three bulbs are out, but now the third is failing too.\n\nAll the bulbs in this fixture were LED bulbs, they were installed tightly, and they were all brand new when I installed them less than a year ago. When I removed the two that wouldn't light and tried them in another fixture, one would not light and the other lit up but only very dimly. This morning the remaining bulb took about 15 seconds to turn on as it flickered dimly, then it lit up at full brightness. I hope that's enough diagnostic information, if not I'll answer any questions.\n\nWhatever tools are required to fix this I probably own or can get (I just don't know where to begin troubleshooting this weird issue.) Why would a light fixture keep burning out bulbs?\n\nThanks in advance for your help.",

Time comes around for inspection and we get told by electrician we can file permit and call for rough inspection to save money (something about company ones being much more expensive). OK, cool, done. Well, the inspector was not pleased. Thankfully he was lenient with us as we have never done this before, but apparently that's a huge no-no. He also had a few issues with wires not being entirely stripped and ready for lights/switches/can boxes (we're putting recessed LEDs in the ceiling so we were told there were no boxes).\n\nOK nbd we'll just call the office and get the guy out to come out and resolve the concerns, and file the permit. We did it in 2 days, won't take long. Well, this is where things turn fishy. Had an appt., but the day of, he doesn't show. I call, get the receptionist who tells me there was a fire at his current site from old wiring and had to postpone for the next day. Not a problem, they've been very communicative up until now and it seems reasonable. Except, we can't get them on the phone now to save our lives. Total silence.\n\nI go on Google and re-check the reviews. I did this at the outset, saw nothing of concern. Well slap me sideways, there are no less than 5 recent reviews that specifically mention this exact issue and only related to permit ghosting. One has called the city. So, I do that, ask to speak to a super. Currently waiting for a call back.\n\nAll that to say: WTF do we do? I've got that damn sinking feeling in my stomach. We checked licenses at the  outset and everything is up to par. We're at a loss for why this is occurring. It's not like they're eating the cost of permits, we are.

The inherent problem I am referring to is the pulse created by the dimmer in order to create the illusion of dimmed lights. Even though I am using ~$30 Lutron switches, they still create harmonics. To the human ear, it is fine and works beautifully, unless you place your ear right up on the switch, but for electronics, such as amplifiers, guitars, and recording equipment, it is a mess of EMI.",

They say it helps with the noise. \n\nThe panel for the stage is always an unbalanced mess, but we make up for it by loading up the other phases a little more on other panels. Have never gotten a call back because of electrical noise coming through their speakers. \n\nIt's worth a shot, but I make no guarantees. Try finding an outlet that you for sure know is on the other leg of the panel, and run an extension cord for your equipment, see what happens with that first. ",

I buy LED light bulbs because they save money on electricity but not when they last about 2 or 3 months in my home. I am constantly changing LED bulbs because they flicker like crazy. I have checked socket torque/tightness and they are tight. Should I start measuring hertz? Dirty power? I’m at a loss. Incandescent bulbs last no issue but obviously cost more to run in electric but I’m certainly not saving money by buying more expensive LED bulbs that don’t last very long at all. \n\nPlease help me solve this mystery!\n\nThanks,",

      "selftext": "Will walk you through the troubleshooting steps I've done.  I am selling my house and was asked to put arc fault into bedroom #2 and bedroom #3.  The labeling/breakers show that two 15A breakers support these rooms and the bathroom, and the bundle of wire is a black, red, white, and white with red stripe for these two.  \n\nI initially replaced both breakers with an arc fault 15A, and the red/red white stays fine, the black/white trips immediately.  It won't even indicate whether arc or ground, just trips.  I swapped arc fault breakers to verify I didn't have a bad one, still trips.\n\nI did some googling and thought I might have a shared neutral, which appears to be wrong.  I ordered a two pole arc fault that is supposed to be for the shared neutral.  Directions didn't seem to match up and this was probably stupid, but I tried different combos.  The black and red in their spots, with either neutral cord in the middle, trips immediately.  If I put both neutral cords in, it stayed semi fine until some load was on it.  \n\nI did more googling and found that I don't think this is the proper way for this circuit, and put the two standalone 15A arc fault breakers back in.  What is odd, is that the red/white red strip, does not appear to power anything.  I can't figure out what it actually powers.\n\nAnyway, the black/white still trips, immediately.  I have replaced CFLs, I removed a switch in one of the rooms, still trips.  Best I can figure at this point is this breakers supports the bathroom (which has a GFCI plug) and both bedrooms light fixtures and plugs.  With everything turned off, nothing plugged in, the thing still trips immediately. I hit the test break on the GFCI plug, tried to flip breaker, still immediately.  No LEDs.  Unsure where to check at this point.. I figured if I had an actual arc fault my house would have had worse problems by this point.  Normal breaker works fine.\n\nAny suggestions greatly appreciated.",

Example would be a two gang switch box were two circuits control two different switches, even though it two different circuits I've seen alot of electricians tie all the neutrals together in that box.  This will work on a standard breaker but if a feed comes back on a neutral from another circuit it'll trip every time.  But I've also seen bath fans trip them and even light bulbs on the first generation arc faults.  If the house has been remodeled troubleshooting can be tricky.  A tried and true method is to trace the circuit disconnecting the rest of the circuit.  An easy explanation of this is to try and rout where the circuit goes first, say a switch box or a receptacle.  Tear apart the tap, see if the breaker holds.  If it does not then the problem is between that location and the panel, if it does hold go a step further and connect the switch back controlling the light or feed it on to the next receptacle where you again tear apart the tap and test the circuit.  This is slow and painful, takes patience and time.  Lots and lots of time if its hard to tell what goes where.",

I recently redid the lighting in my home as well and went with some smart rgbyw wafer lights, and I absolutely love the color changing and smart dimming. You can also set them up to be autonomous with schedules and even motion detection. Which is nice because that eliminates the need for expensive switching as well. Also because of their slim design, you can place them where ever, even under a truss. The worst thing is always placing your lights and going to cut in a hole for it to be off of your measurement due to an obstruction.",

      "selftext": "Hello electricians! \n\nBuilding a new house and had a chance to test out the lights the other day. Lights in the bathroom gave me quick pause and since I don't have direct contact to the electrician who did the wiring, asking here in case this is something serious that needs to be brought up.\n\nThere is a tiled shower that has two separate recessed LED BR30 lights over it (enclosed). They are wired to a two rocker (double?) switch right outside of it. (Two switches ultimately, a switch for lights and a switch for fan). One of the rockers is for the lights, another is for an exhaust fan that's right outside the shower as well. As I was casually flipping switches to check if everything works, I turned on the lights over the shower, let them stay on for a short bit, turned them off and immediately turned on the fan. At that moment the furthest light lit up very dim, just a bit, and turned off. Flipping the fan switch on/off again would cause it to do the same maybe 2 more times with reduced intensity until it wouldn't. Repeating the process - letting shower lights stay on for 10 sec, turn off and turn on fan - recreated the pattern.\n\nIs this a grounding issue or a light bulb issue (can't check until I have the keys) or something else that I'm dealing with?\n\nThank you!",

      "selftext": "Hi there, first time on this sub and I am not an electrician.  I don’t know if this is the right sub to ask or not... but here goes.  I am replacing a dimmer switch with a smart dimmer switch.  The dimmer switch requires a neutral cable.  Before the installation, there are two switches on the wall, one for the dimmer light which I am replacing and the other is a fan.   These older switch did not use a neutral wire but since this house was built 8 yrs ago there are neutral cables there but bundled together with a plastic screw cap.  So my question is, when replacing the the light dimmer switch with the smart one  (requires a neutral wire), can I add the neutral wire from the smart switch to the bundled existing neutral wires or do I have to separate the bundle and attached one of them (don’t know which one) to the neutral wire of the smart switch?  Currently I have the neutral wire from the smart switch to the bundle and it’s working okay but I have notice a buzzing sound from the lights only when dimmed. I don’t remember if it was buzzing before.  Is the buzzing related to this issue as well?  Hopefully, I explained it so that everyone can understand.  Thank you in advance if you can help.",

      "selftext": "Good morning electricians of Reddit! I have a help request (really, 3 requests) because I have no idea what I am doing and I don't want to break anything or spend money on the wrong stuff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Porch light flickers/dims randomly\n\nI've used dimmable and non-dimmable LEDs in this fixture, both change brightness at seemingly random intervals. I've observed the light reaching full brightness while fiddling with the fixture (rotating, tilting etc). I've put a Feit Dusk to Dawn Intellibulb out there and witnessed an absolute strobe show.\n\nFirst, I don't know what's the problem here causing the inconsistent light.\n\nSecond, I have no idea how to take it off the wall to see what's going on behind it (I do know which breaker disables it so I can do so safely). There's no visible nuts/bolts/connectors except for the two sticking out the front, including on the inside of the bulb enclosure. The fixture rotates easily through 180 degrees either direction but I don't want to push it further in case it's wiring, and not a threaded connection, that's limiting further movement.\n\nThird, I have no idea what the fixture model is (picture included), which I imagine would be mighty helpful at least as far as removal is concerned.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Buzzing bedroom lights\n\n12.5 W LED dimmables in a non-dimming ceiling fan fixture and they buzz like an angry beehive. I swapped in an 8.5W non-dimmable and got the same buzz in one of the 3 light fixtures on this device. Ceiling fan lights, y u buzz?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Moderate flicker in other bedroom lights.\n\nThe other bedroom is equipped with 8.5 W non-dimmable LEDs. At least one or two of them are usually flickering steadily, not enough to fully darken the room or even really make a person uncomfortable but just enough to notice the varying intensity. Ceiling fan lights, y u flicker?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've already solved one issue on my own, with severe flickering/dimming in the living room depending on how the kitchen and dining room lights were being used. I swapped the dimmable bulbs for slightly lower power non-dimmables, and swapped the kitchen lights for lower power options as well, to successfully mitigate the living room flicker. But these other issues have me stumped.\n\n[The Light Fixture - two switches underneath. One with settings \\\\\"TEST, 1, 5, 10 Minutes\\\\\" set to TEST, the other with \\\\\"OFF, 3, 6 HOUR, Dusk To Dawn\\\\\" set to Dusk to Dawn.

But there seems to be an exception for “lighting loads.” Would LED strips fall under that category of lighting loads? \n\nI recently bought a dimmable LED light strip (working voltage: 12V DC). One end of the strip has exposed wires for a hard wired connection while the other end connects to a dimmer which connects to a transformer that plugs into an outlet (you can forgo the dimmer connection if you don’t want to dim). My understanding is that if i plug the lights into an outlet, i need to use the included transformer and if i want to hardwire them then i need a new transformer (which seems to cost around $150-$200) that changes the voltage to 12V for the lights. I’d like to dim the lights from my kitchen switch (it used to control a light that was in there but i disconnected and removed the light to look at the wires, they’re standard B/W/copper). \n\nFor my question: \nIf i install a dimmer in the kitchen then can i install an outlet that’s connected to my kitchen dimmer and plug the lights into that outlet so that they’re dimmed from the switch? I want to do this for 1) a cleaner look and 2) the ability to dim without having to walk over to the outlet each time to use the included dimmer. \n\nAll help would be appreciated!!",

I replaced the original switch with a smart dimmer, and installed two dimmable LED bulbs. Turned it on, only one side worked. Undid everything to check wiring and stuff, couldn't find anything wrong, so I put everything back together and tried again, still only one side would work. So what I found:\n\n\\- Side A with a dimmable, Side B with a non-dimming bulb, works (except the non-dimming doesn't dim of course),\n\n\\- Both sides with a dimmable bulb, only one side come on, always the same side, even when I swap the bulbs.\n\n\\- new bulbs in both, same issues.\n\nThis is a Gosund smart dimmer switch. I have a couple of others installed around the house, no issues. I have not resorted to swapping it out with another one yet, but wondering if there is something I'm missing.\n\nETA: Final note in case anyone googles this. \n\nI threw in a 60-watt GE branded dimmable, and it worked fine. I bought two new GE branded 100-watt dimmable, and while they are huge compared to the other bulbs, they both fit, and both work, dimmed, etc. All good now.",

A cheap inverter could be running a square wave which can definitely cause the issues your talking about, modified should be okay but pure is what you really should be using for electronics to function properly. That's my main guess, but then you should also check your frequency at the dimmer with a meter, if you're in north America you should be showing 60hz. \nHope this helps.\n\nEdit: just looked up your inverter, it is pure sine wave.

(Exact switch: [https://www.lowes.com/pd/Lutron-Diva-LED-Dimmer/1002704132?cm\\_mmc=shp-\\_-c-\\_-prd-\\_-elc-\\_-ggl-\\_-LIA\\_ELC\\_205\\_Wiring-Devices-Extension-Cords-\\_-1002704132-\\_-0-\\_-0-\\_-0&ds\\_rl=1286981&ds\\_a\\_cid=112741100&gclid=Cj0KCQjw-4SLBhCVARIsACrhWLWakUD3i9WUGGmWNmxpbl-bkn1QALInDAY6gIt71SzFsebHFEd-T58aAoBIEALw\\_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Lutron-Diva-LED-Dimmer/1002704132?cm_mmc=shp-_-c-_-prd-_-elc-_-ggl-_-LIA_ELC_205_Wiring-Devices-Extension-Cords-_-1002704132-_-0-_-0-_-0&ds_rl=1286981&ds_a_cid=112741100&gclid=Cj0KCQjw-4SLBhCVARIsACrhWLWakUD3i9WUGGmWNmxpbl-bkn1QALInDAY6gIt71SzFsebHFEd-T58aAoBIEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)). I found it weird that this switch doesn't require a neutral. I wired the black, red & ground with the third wire capped off as this isn't a 3-way light. With everything installed and the light on, I get a constant buzzing regardless of what the dimmer setting is at. I tried adjusting the toggle switch behind the switch panel for +/- the maximum dim setting, but nothing changes. The buzzing is constant regardless of the brightness. Looking more into this I BELIEVE it's required that I install a reverse-phase dimmer switch to compensate for the lower voltage - but I'm not entirely sure. It also may be that the neutral IS required? I'm pretty much stumped at this point. Before I bite the bullet and spend $70 on a switch to test out, I wanted to post here and see if anyone has come across this issue. Any help is appreciated.",

I can't easily find that spec on the HD website.\n\nBecause LEDs use such little power, we also run into the situation that they don't use enough power to be dimmed, because the semi-conductor components inside solid state dimmers require enough power flowing through them to function properly, a single LED light can be as low 7w or less, which isn't enough to dim with many dimmers.\n\nBuying a higher quality dimmer, like a Diva ELV, or Lutron Sunata, might fix the issue. But you might simply be out of luck. I often have to tell people that they cannot dim 1 or 2 recessed lights, because 14 watts isn't enough to dim.",

      "selftext": "Hello, I'm having an issue where I noticed a popping sound that would trigger every 5 seconds or so from my pc's speakers when my TV's hdmi cable is plugged into the pc, even though my pc and speakers was turned off on the outlet. I spoke with someone and what we could gather is that I'm having a static buildup on the hdmi cable coming from the TV and that's whats causing an occasional pop sound from my speakers. I've tested with different TV's and different hdmi cables, and the issue persists. As discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/audio/comments/nql6bp/popping_from_speakers_when_tv_is_connected_to_pc/h0d7pgi/) the static buildup was identified by placing an LED between the pc back plate and the hdmi cable and seeing that the LED would dimly blink and then have to wait a few seconds before it would blink again. The solution may require grounding, but the house I am in (I live in Denmark) is old and does not have grounded outlets, so I'm unable to do so. I was told I might be able to attach something to the pc case to prevent the static buildup.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThrough my testing I've found these scenarios:\n\n1. Touching the pc case with the hdmi cable will cause a tiny spark and can cause the pc monitor to blink black for a split second occasionally.\n2. Speakers pop when hdmi cable is plugged into pc and speakers are plugged into pc.\n3. Speakers stop popping when removing the hdmi cable, but plugging the speakers into the tv instead will make the popping return (I think that isolates the issue is coming from the TV, since whenever the TV is connected to the system in any way it causes the popping sound).\n\nI've been using the system for over 2 years now and I've always just unplugged the hdmi cable to stop the popping since I didn't know better, but now that I've been informed, I'm worried it might cause a problem in the future.\n\nI hope that's enough information to go on. I don't have much knowledge of electricity.\nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT: So I just had a thought that I should try removing the antenna cable from the back of the TV. When I did that, the sparks no longer happen when the hdmi touches the pc case! Everything seems fine now. Could I then assume that the issue is coming from the TV antenna cable? Probably a faulty installation from the wall box or something.",

      "selftext": "I kinda at a loss as what went wrong today. \n\nI was upstairs in a bedroom in the back corner of our house using a table saw. The table saw got stuck on a piece of wood and shut off. The power strip didn't trip nor did the circuit breaker. I never got the saw to come back on (different issue for another time) so I had to use another saw to finish working. I did notice that using that saw caused the light to dim. This was my first indication that something was wrong.\n\nI went downstairs once it got dark and went to grab something from our garage (same side of house as upstairs bedroom) and the light didn't work. Luckily the outlet that has our freezer was fine but no lights. I figured it was a bad bulb until I tried to open the garage and the outlet for it is dead. I found that the garage, the bathroom (light and fan but not outlet) next to it, the closet next to bathroom and the garage entry light and oddly the outside light on the other side of house are all dead.\n\nI looked in the fuse box and everything looks alright. That system is on a 15 amp circuit breaker and it seems to be working fine. I pulled all the working outlets in the bedroom which consist of  5 4 wire outlets and 1 2 wire outlet, all look fine on visual inspection. I checked in the attic but I was unable to see any of the wiring.\n\nMy next step tomorrow is to kill the main power and swap the wires with the 15 amp circuit breaker right above it that controls the other bedroom to see if the circuit breaker is bad. I doubt that is the issue, but I need to verify all the simple things before chasing wires in the walls. \n\nI'm just trying to see if this has happened to anyone else and what the problem might be.\n\n**TLDR:** table saw pulled to much current and killed half the lights on a 15 amp circuit without tripping the breaker and now I am lost on the best way to troubleshoot this.\n\n**Update:** Checked all the light switches downstairs after verifying the breaker was fine. The very last switch (the outside light) seemed to be the culprit as once I pulled it away the bathroom light flickered. I pulled the wires and connected them to the screws instead of the hole. I am not sure if it was caused by the saw or just a weird coincidence, but all is well now. The saw is still not working so that's another issue all together.",

What kind of electrician are you?\n\nOn to your problem: Look for a GFI outlet outside your garage that's tripped. Barring that, your receptacles are probably being used as junction blocks, with power coming through each receptacle  instead of the junctions being pigtailed in each box. What often happens is a heavy load melts the little spring tab that holds the wire in place in the receptacle \"back stab\" holes, and you either lose the connection or melt the receptacle.\n\nWhat you're going to have to do in that case is follow the circuit back from each dead receptacle to the panel, opening each one up and figuring out which one is damaged. While you have each one open, pigtail each box and install a new receptacle to prevent this from happening again.",

You might have a shared neutral on 2 circuits feeding the entire downstairs area that's without power, and a broken neutral somewhere. The easiest way to determine if the neutral is bad is to test one of the bad receptacles: measure for power across the hot and ground terminals. If you have 120 volts, you have a bad neutral somewhere. You can also run an extension cord from a known good receptacle to a bad outlet, and test for voltage across the cord's hot and dead outlet's neutral, and vice-versa. That will tell you which conductor is bad, and you can work backwards at each receptacle and switch on the circuit, dragging the cord along with you to test each one.

The lights came on, then after a second they all turned off. Each time I tried turning them on they would do the exact same thing.\n\nI removed one of the 4 incandescent bulbs and replaced it with the previous LED bulb and then it worked.\n\nI’m so confused what could be causing this. It is a Hunter fan, not sure which model. It has a remote that supports dimming the lights, so I’m assuming it has that capability (although even when the LED bulbs are used attempting to dim them only makes them strobe). \n\nAny ideas what’s going on here?",

I can’t set the lights to high/med/low, I can only hold the power button to dim/brighten. Since the bulbs don’t actually dim, it only changes from fast strobe to slow strobe so I’m flying blind trying to get them on a setting that eliminates the strobe. The only setting which seems to stop the strobing is apparently the dimmest setting, which doesn’t really help because the room is so dark.\n\nI can swap out the LEDs for 40w incandescents, but I’d prefer to use LED if at all possible.

      "selftext": "I am hoping this is an appropriate forum to ask this question, as I posed it in r/HomeImprovement and received some thoughts.  Obviously, this may be a better place to help me figure out this issue.\n\nI purchased a new home (new construction) about seven months ago.  The house has LED lights everywhere.  Well, when my washing machine agitates (It does not have an agitator so the drum spins and stops repetitively to get the same action) my lights flicker.  So in a normal cycle, the lights will flicker for about 20 minutes.  They do not go out, just dim.  I have only noticed this issue in my kitchen/Dinning room, which are on the same circuit.  I cannot replicate the problem when I turn on the air conditioner, but can with a vacuum cleaner (but I think vacuums do this regardless?)\n\nFirst, I checked for a loose neutral on the washing machine circuit, this did not fix the issue.  Then, I had the electric company come out and test my incoming line to ensure I was getting the correct/consistent input.  They used some load device that they said showed no issues on their side.\n\nPrior to doing any of this, I asked the electrician who wired my house.  The house is under warranty, so if there is an issue, it will get fixed; however, he told me that new electric panels had a \"smart\" ground fault system that caused the panel to start a shut down process when the washer spooled up due to the sudden load.  He told me the issue was the combination of the box and LED lights (As traditional lights would not respond in the same manner).  This explanation seems like a cop out based on research I have done and conversations I have had.  To note, I have little faith in the electrician.  \n\nThe Builder likes them, but I can read code and there are some obvious, albeit minor, issues with their work.  Not to mention the fact that they did rough wiring in an unfinished basement and ran the entire basement (2500+ sqft) off of one 15-amp circuit.  Wires are unsecured in several places and they took obvious short-cuts in the way they wired some receptacles.\n\nSo, the question is what are your thoughts?  Is this likely a loose neutral problem in my kitchen circuit, somewhere else, or something is completely different at hand?",

          "body": "The electrical contractor is giving you a little bit of truth and a bunch of bologna.\n\nLED lights are more sensitive to voltage fluctuation, that's a fact.\n\nThe nonsense about the panel and some smart grounding something or other was just them trying to pull the wool over your eyes.\nWhat your panel does have is some combination of AFCI, GFCI and dual function circuit breakers, but thus far you have mentioned nothing about breakers tripping or anything that is cause for delving into that subject. \n\nGenerally speaking washing machines do cause this issue even with incandescent and fluorescent lights in some homes, I've dealt with it for 20 years and just accept that it's normal.\n\nTo be more technical about it, what you are witnessing is the lights reacting to a voltage fluctuation. The washing machine is causing a voltage fluctuation during the agitation cycle, as the load on a motor is cyclical and the amount of mechanical load on the motor changes throughout one interval of agitation movement, therefore when it's at the peak amount of mechanical load it draws the highest amount of current and when it's at the least amount of mechanical load it draws the lowest amount of current.\n\nNot all washing machines exhibit this behavior as much as others, it really depends on how it was engineered to operate. I know for sure that most of the whirlpool direct drive machines from the 90s up to the 2010s definitely exhibit the behavior, but also a number of the newer top load agitatorless models that exhibit a pulsing movement (Whirlpool/Kenmore and GE) cause the same thing to happen.",

The new fixtures have been purchased by the owner so im not sure what his reasoning was but im acting as a property manager on this one so ill be subbing it out.\n5. No deadline for completion (within reason)\n\n\nI appreciate yall bearing with me. Lol",

Do we have to move stuff underneath the lights? Are we going to need a lift? Would it make more sense to do it off ladders? \n\nThis could easily make a $1-2000 per day day difference if they need to rent a scissor lift. \n\n2. What's the nature of the business? Is it going to be open or closed? Working around the public, or in the back of the warehouse? \n\n3. Do any boxes need any modifications to hang the new fixtures? If any rework is involved this could be easily $100-300 or more per fixture depending on what they need to do \n\n4. Can one man hang a light or will it take two or three? This can easily double your labor costs. \n\n5. Usually when a customer buys materials to save money, they probably would have saved more by asking us to pick the best lights. Why? Because well pick lights that are easy to work with and fit the application. Maybe you bought lights that every single one needs to be altered to fit where it's going. \n\n\nI can keep going but these are several big ticket items that you can't even get into the ballpark of before you figure it out. \n\nPut it this way though, each laborer should be $180-$1,000 per day. Plus materials and overhead. $180 being on the low end where guys don't speak English and don't wear safety shoes and have tools from Walmart. $1,000 is probably for an outfit that owns their own lifts, super clean and professional, they probably offer a wicked warranty, they probably have some smart and good electricians working there. \n\nMaybe the workers aren't making that much but that's what boss man should be charging for each guy. \n\nSo if you have 3 guys who take 2 days to do it, you could easily be looking at $1,500 - $10,000 in labor and equipment rentals.",

I would also add some additional retention of some sort to ensure that they never fall into the water.  The control box and the plug in itself would be connected inside of a waterproof outdoor enclosure I am using to connect the pump/filtration system to power.  Finally, the circuit that all of this is on is fed from a GFCI.  On/Off functionality would be controlled via Bluetooth.\n\nI have put essentially the same type of LED lighting on the underside of my truck for courtesy lighting and they have been in service for over a year now with no issues whatsoever.\n\nI think that there is basically no risk with these lights, but you all know far more than I.  In your professional opinion is this a bad idea?\n\nI appreciate your time, so thank you all in advance!",

I’m trying to determine if replacing the light will solve the problem. \n\nThe light does have a dimmer built into it, so it’s not a compatibility issue with the dimmer, and it flickers when the light is up 100% anyway. I’ve lived in this place for over a year and it’s just now becoming a visible issue. \n\nThe light is about 3 years old, I visually inspected it for an out-of-whack capacitor but everything looks fine. \n\nThe light flickers in all the outlets in our apartment (more on that later)\n\nThe light flickers SIGNIFICANTLY LESS when plugged in at a friend’s house. \n\nI’ve tried switching the polarity at my place and my friend’s place, it doesn’t make a difference. \n\nIn regards to our apartment (US), the multimeter reads ~112V all around the place, I assume that’s not an issue. \n\nMy power strips flicker and other LED bulbs like to hum, this could be an issue with these components though. \n\nI guess my question is, what troubleshooting can I do of the building electricity to know if the issue lies there or what it could be? I am interested by the fact that the light performs much better at a different residence. \n\nI’ve ordered a new bulb to see if that works, but I want to be sure I’m not slowly frying it by plugging it into the same thing. \n\nThanks!",

So essentially a GFCI breaker controlling a circuit with a GFCI receptacle. \n\nWhen I flip switch to run my disposer, my GFCI breaker trips which has the lights (again both are separate circuits). \n\nI replaced my disposer last week which was hardwired and converted it to a single receptacle outlet by code. I’ve always noticed the sconce lights above disposer dimmed when disposer was turned on, but I know they are both different circuits. This breaker tripping issue never occurred prior to installing the GFCI breaker. \n\nWhat could be causing this? Maybe they share a J box along the way and there is an arc?\n\nTIA\n\n(Not an electrician)",

      "selftext": "I work with a company that does a lot of heat pumps, they installed a new heat pump and air handler in a customers home. Now all the X10 smart switches close to the system work manually but not with WiFi like they should. If the system is off the customer can use there phone to control these lights, when on switches not near the system work as they should. This seems like a frequency issue. \n\nGrounding and bonding meet code. Each dimmer is grounded and uses a neutral wire.  \n\nWhen the heat pump is off and the air handler is using the heat strips only 1 switch is effected, the others then work fine.\n\nKeep in mind it’s not causing the lights to blink or dim weird, just not connect to their iPhone. \n\nIf anyone knows how to fix this without replacing every switch that would be great. This is a 15 year old Insteon(think that’s the correct spelling) system. \n\nThanks",

I don't know know but years ago they had a filter/bridge that hooked into the panel and bridged the poles and filtered the frequency noise.  The heat pumps and probably producing the same sine wave as the off or cancel signal for the x10. One thing to try is to switch the wires at the heat pump breaker. Maybe the heat pump is only transmitting on one leg. Good luck!!",

      "selftext": "I have a 3 way switch in upstairs loft/living room. 1 switch controls a wall outlet, 1 the fan, 1 the light on the fan. I installed a new ceiling fan with remote, fan works as it should. Decided to put in a dimmer on the light switch because the fan uses Edison bulbs, there is nothing more than a cage around the bulbs so at times the light is kind of harsh (60w)\n\nI used a non-led Lutron dimmer. Seemed to work fine but at lower than 50% there was some flicker (which I understand is because of the reduced current or something). The bulbs are LED and dimmable.\n\nThen I decided to try the led version of the Lutron dimmer and had all kind of weird problem. Using the remote sometimes turning the fan on and  turned off the lights and vice versa. Removed that, put the original non-led dimmer in. Decided I'd live with the flicker if I really wanted the lights under 50%. But after putting the  non-led dimmer back in the next day I noticed the fan seemed to be significantly louder than I remembered initially. I Googled that and find that dimmers can cause the motors to run harder, louder, and burn out quicker. So out that came and back to the regular switch.\n\nIs there anything out there I can use, to get the lights in the fan to dim without causing issues with the fan motor or flickering?",

      "selftext": "Back story....\n\nPicked up a home near TX coast about a yr or so ago built in 84. Seemed pretty typical for what you'd expect electrically for it's age/location, including an item or 2 of poor previous work. As such, everything is pretty much standard for the time such as no AFCI/GFCI, 2 wire (plus ground) on the 240's vs 3, no tamper resistant outlets, etc. Except for pointing out the above type stuff that doesn't meet current code, the home inspector gave the electrical system a clean bill of health except pointing out an odd way the panel was wired. The grounds on a good number of the circuits are twisted together where they enter the panel to the lugs (2 'bundles'/lugs of 5 or 6 grounds each). Each is a nice tight consistent looking twist and appear to be original if not at least been that way for a very long time, so he saw no issue with that functionally (nor did I), but did point out it being unusual (and I never had seen one done like that). Everything else was fine, each N and G in their own holes on the bus bar etc. I still question if that's even legit (I think probably not), but it's an outdoor 150a panel showing it's age so replacing it and upgrading to 200 is something I want to do eventually anyways. After closing on the house, checked the electrical more thoroughly during fixture changes and every other connection just because. I'm not a residential electrician, but am an aircraft mechanic so I do know full well the importance of proper connections, resistance and such, and all that fun stuff. In fact that led to new fixtures and all in nearly the entire house. Switches and outlets were all back stabbed with many connections having not been landed right to begin with or else worked themselves out a bit over the years, metal boxes not properly grounded, stuff like that...so between changing the fans and lights I wanted and replacing all the switches and outlets with better ones, all that stuff is new...so everything inside is properly wired and grounded and good with multimeter. \n\nCurrent situation....\n\nGround rod got bumped into by mower wheel which happens now and then. It's up a few inches from the ground 4 or 5 inches from slab as is typical around here. Immediately following that, lights and such would randomly have minor dim/flickers...much like a heavy load starting up like hvac would do, but with no heavy load starting up even at neighboring houses much less mine. Remembering I bumped the ground rod mowing, that's the first thing I went and looked at. I noticed the acorn nut was not very tight. Not fall apart loose, but you could move it without a whole lot of effort. OK, simple enough, retorque it. Got out the torque wrench and quickly realized as soon as I started turning it that the acorn was cracked, which is prob why it wasnt tight to begin with! Anyhow replaced that and all went back well again, so I'm pretty sure that was the cause...but that makes me question SHOULD that be the cause?!? Seems to me something isnt right. For plumbing, PVC comes from the street to a stub out on exterior wall, then copper or whatever from there in this area, so electric isnt typically grounded to plumbing. It's pretty much just the return to the transformer and ground electrode(s). In this case, would a poor ground rod connection cause that much of a difference? Seems to me the return to the transformer should be doing the heavy lifting with the ground rod being secondary having little to no effect during normal conditions (like no lightning/surges/other significant instabilities). From the transformer, the triplex comes down to smaller pole and splits off to my weather head on one side and neighbors on the other. Neighbor has no issues, but neither did I till I apparently knocked the ground connection to the rod a bit loose with the mower and none since fixing  it. Does this sound normal or is there likely still a problem somewhere?",

Def not game for messing with it further. Guess I'll get the power co to check their end, and if nothing found there, call the sparkys and prob just get the entire panel changed like I was intending to eventually do as well as the wire between the meter and it (which likely would be done anyways with the upgrade) if it's not a quick fix.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks guys!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh and last thing....have you ever seen or heard about grounds being twisted/bundled together and placed in larger lugs as described above vs 1 or 2 per hole in the bus bar as usual?

Look, if an electrician has installed a part that doesn't operate as intended, its their responsibility to rectify or give your money back. Imagine you bought a car, it misfires and car yard said they can't find anything wrong with it. I didn't mean so much YOU would have to pay for it, but ultimately someone does.. If a cost was quoted, then it's the companies problem to make it work as quoted. That's why you get quotes, the hidden costs HAVE to be outlined prior to acceptance of work.

All of the lights on both circuits are sconces with a single 150w worklight-style Halogens.  Client has already replaced all but one bulb on each circuit with 9w LEDs.  Four fixtures on the Caseta circuit, two fixtures on the Lumea one.  Install goes smoothly, both dimmers work properly and all bulbs dim like they should.\n\nClient asks me to install the last two LED bulbs before I leave.  The Caseta circuit is turned off at the switch, but as soon as I remove the Halogen bulb all the remaining lights immediately start flickering.  This continues when I put the new LED bulb in.  The switch itself is unresponsive.  The circuit goes back to normal when I replace the LED with a Halogen.  The Lumea circuit's malfunction is different; when the Halogen is removed both LEDs stay at half-brightness no matter what the dimmer is set to.\n\nThere were non-LED dimmers in place before and I didn't bother to play with them before removal but apparently they did the same thing; Client had been told the issue was dimmer compatibility, hence why I was installing new ones.",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nSo to start, I don't know much about electricity, and I apologize if my questions are a little too elementary. I bought a house last year and basically bought it as-is, and assumed that a bunch of the lights that were out were just dead bulbs. Fast forward a year later, and I ask a handyman to change out the bulbs, and he says there's a problem with the electric. Here's what they look like:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gk652qmdjc451.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4da14769acdff5e35dc03bd82dde399d5e399834\n\nI called my home warranty company to try and do something, and they needed to cut a hole open next to the light, because for some reason they couldn't pull out the light. Well it turns out, each of these are 12V lights with a transformer attached. The transformers are actually larger than the hole that the light comes out of. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ai5hkneijc451.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de721d703c62f8a86e32a0a9fc5b08e252f65aa6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oq9ewfeijc451.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f1e60b0cd92a8d9c30348fb0fd3aa73af30619ea\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yq8oaneijc451.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b1237d04afc6744846ad5c42d87383ec11008ca\n\nThe home warranty company won't cover it, because since there is a transformer, it's not an electrical issue, but a transformer issue. The best guess for at least 70% of the lights being out is because the transformers are all dead (they were installed probably between 2004-2006). I could have each of the transformers replaced, but the electrician let me know that they would probably die again in about ten years. Oops, I forgot to mention, I own a two unit house, and there are 12 more of the lights upstairs, half of which are out. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uv08rn2okc451.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2a34b188eaee256de804ccd3b2ba35a2168b0076\n\nSo my questions for this subreddit:\n\n1. Would you replace the transformers, or just have new recessed lighting that uses 120V (and this is n00b me... doesn't most indoor lighting just use 120V?)? Is one more cost effective than the other?\n2. What would be the best way to handle all of these (if possible) with minimal damage to the ceilings? I know that I'm going to have to pay to get things re-drywalled/painted, but do I really need 18 holes?\n3. For the last photo, I thought it would potentially be cool to get rid of all those lights, since I have chandeliers there anyway, and maybe do an LED strip hidden in the recessed portion. Do you have any thoughts on that?\n4. Open to any other options that would be \"trendy\" or cost effective. I bought a two-unit to airbnb one, but also haven't started airbnb because of Covid-19. My home looks mostly historic with modern touches, so it's sort of anything goes!\n\nThank you all so much for any help, and if there is anything that I need to do to the post to make it fit (didn't see any rules) it'd be much appreciated!",

      "selftext": "Good eve,\n\nMy bathroom light randomly started flickering one day. Not a straight on/off, but dimming and brightening nonstop. Figured it was the bulb and found out it’s an LED fixture (just bought the house short of 2 years ago). \n\nI disconnected it and hooked my multimeter up to the wiring and that’s varying as well, so it’s not the light. We have several things on the same breaker, none of which are having issues at all. \n\nFor shits and giggles, I bought a new switch and replaced the old one, same problem. Oddly, if you turn on another light on the same breaker, it goes to full power and takes a few seconds to start flickering again, same thing when you turn the light itself on/off. \n\nCould it be a short? \n\nI’m a property engineer and work on AC’s/basic property repairs all day long and I can’t figure this out, it’s driving me nuts!\n\nThank you ahead of time for any input/suggestions!",

      "selftext": "The problem started at the start of the year, when the washing machine in my toilet is on, the monitor would shut down and back up, however it would only happen when i just plugged the washer in a wall socket, it's at high rpm or if i took the cable out of the wall but sometimes.\n\nAt September I bought some LED strip lights, whenever I'd plug them in, same thing happens, screen shuts down, and unfortunately the shop i bought it from did not firmly place the 2 pin connector inside the strip so when it loses connection to the light strip it shuts down my monitor.\n\n\nToday it was the worst, started by my monitor going off randomly but occasionally then the last time I started smelling a wire burn, i immediately checked all the wires and both my PC and monitor cables(my wires are connected to an extension plug) , they weren't hot, there was no molten plastic and no charring, the smell was there but it was weak neither was the extension plug, i checked the wire of the extension plug it wasn't hot, and then I checked the extension plug's plug that's plugged into the wall socket, same thing, it wasn't hot, nothing molten or burnt but the smell was strong in the wall socket itself and nothing extra in the room or the toilet was active either. \n\nMy extension plug handles 13 Amps, 240volts, bought it with my equipment in mind so it handles both my PC and monitor, so I can only assume the problem is in the wall socket. \n\nHowever, the wall socket was changed mid last year by an expert and we did General maintenance to the apartment's electricity from breaker fuses, sockets to the wires in the main breaker in the basement. \n\nOne thing is that the breaker fuse connected to my room didn't shut down as it's safety feature applies, that fuse was changed before 2 years ago the fuse is rated to handle 30 amps as far as I remember \n\nThe only thing thats old is the wiring all throughout the apartment but we never had trouble with the actual wires though, usually only the fuses or sockets and also it's weird that my PC never shut down when it happens, it's only my monitor losing power. \n\nI need a general idea of what the actual issue can be so I can act accordingly, if it's pretty much a fuse change or so I can do it myself if it's (hopefully not) the wires in the room I'll have a professional look at it.\n\nIf any extra information is needed to diagnose this, please ask away however keep in mind that it's really late for me now I might be asleep but I'll respond tomorrow.\n\nThanks in advance.",

      "selftext": "I recently moved and am replacing outlets/switches/lights. I decided to replace a Broan 668-f ceiling fan with a Broan 668. The new one fit the same but I did not replace the housing which includes the wiring. The new fan plugs into the old housing. \n\nLast week I replaced the vanity light with an LED fixture. \n\nToday I replaced the switch to a Leviton 5634-W double rocker switch and a new GFCI outlet. \n\nIf I have the vanity light on and I quickly shut off the exhaust fan, the light flickers off and back on. The lights in the hallway (on the same circuit) also flicker for a slight second. The hallway lights are not LED. If I slowly switch the exhaust fan off, it stays on. If I quickly switch the exhaust fan off, it usually causes the lights to flicker. I already re terminated the wires on each end and have the same issue. \n\nI don't remember this happening before I changed the switch and fan motor. I reconnected the old exhaust motor which has the same issue present. \n\nNot sure how else to troubleshoot this or what the issue may be? Could it be bad wiring between the exhaust fan box and the outlet box? Unsure what could cause this. \n\nIt does not seem to be an issue when I turn the exhaust fan on, only turning it off.\n\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/1Fe9jF9f1xkL5d8j9\n\nPhotos include old switch and GFCI. Video of issue. \n\n\nEDIT: I went and reterminated and capped the exhaust fan wires. I also did the same to the neutral wires in the box. \n\nThe wires going to my GFCI are windowed (middle stripped) not sure if this could at all be a culprit. Not sure if I should piggytail them. \n\nAfter doing this my hallway lights don't seem to flicker.",

      "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’ve recently bought a fan (Home Decorators Collection Kensgrove 54 in. Integrated LED Indoor Espresso Bronze Ceiling Fan with Light Kit and Remote Control) from Home Depot. I followed the instruction, connecting white to white, black to black, and ground to ground. The  Fan LED light doesn’t work and neither does the fan, the only way to use the fan is with the remote which doesn’t do anything. I’ve tried connecting and reconnecting the cables and nothing. I have a dimmable switch with 4 recessed lights connected to it, along with the new interior fan. The lights work fine, they turn on, dim up and down, and they turn off just fine but nothing with the fan. Any suggestions would be appreciated. If you have encounter a similar issue, please share!\n\nI first thought it was a problem with the fan itself so I exchanged it with another one, still nothing.",

You cant put a ceiling fan on a dimmer switch that is connected to other can lights.\n\nYou are DIMMING the receiver up in the canopy, so of course the remote isnt going to work. This is like attaching a dimmer switch to an outlet, and then plugging in your TV, and dimming the TV. You ruin the TV by doing that. Dimmer switches alter the sine wave that is being sent up to lights, EVEN when they are set to max, so dont ask if it should work even if you set it to max and leave it there, it wont.\n\nYou need to have the ceiling fan on a separate, NON-dimmer switch from the can lights.",

      "selftext": "Edit: this has been solved and thanks to u/wytheguy. CL Maestros do in fact work with a mechanical switch on the other end of the 3\\-way, and it doesn't even have to be a 3\\-way switch. Nor does it matter, apparently, whether you have power to the dimmer first or not. Common on the mechanical switch side gets spliced with the traveler that's *not* on the dimmer's blue 'communication wire' screw. So only two screws needed, hence being able to use a single\\-pole single\\-throw switch, which is neat. Once you have this wired you need to program the dimmer to accept the mechanical switch with a sequence of button presses \\(press and hold the tap button and up on the rocker until the middle LED blinks, then press and hold the down button on the rocker until the bottom LED blinks, then press the tap button once to save the setting\\).\n\nFor the first time I've run into a 3\\-way switching issue that I thought I'd share to get feedback or at least warn people before they waste as much time as I did on this, or find out why I'm an idiot.\n\nSo these fancy dimmers that have an indicator light when they're off \\(specifically Lutron Maestro\\) say on the packaging and in the literature that they're compatible with either a standard 3\\-way switch or a companion dimmer of the same type. Obviously they work like anything else, one side gets the line and one side gets the load with a 3\\-wire between them. I've installed them before, and on this particular job I installed the master/companion as a 3\\-way no problem, single pole no problem....sort of, more on that later.\n\nBut when I installed one with a regular analog 3\\-way switch on the other end it just doesn't work once you turn off the lights from the non\\-dimmer side, no power at all. So I tried everything, just to see if I was losing my mind. I tried jumping the load wire to the standard 3\\-way switch thinking maybe the digital circuitry in the dimmer only works if it's not the line side. That could make sense, it needs some current to keep the indicator light on in the off position. No difference. I tried another identical Lutron Maestro dimmer in case the first one I  used was defective, no difference. The chance of getting two defective ones in a row must be astronomical, right? I tried it with a slide dimmer with an analog switch knowing it shouldn't work and it didn't. I tried it with the standard 3\\-way switch and a regular slide/switch combo dimmer and it worked normally, so there's definitely no issue with the wiring. I tried it with a non\\-companion dimmer of the same type and it didn't work, as expected.\n\nIs it possible that contrary to the manufacturer's instructions these just don't work with a standard 3\\-way switch, even with the dimmer always receiving power in every position?\n\nAnd getting back to the single\\-pole installation of the same dimmer, I tried to use them with LED puck\\-lights for under\\-cab lights. Of course making sure that both the dimmer and the lights advertise themselves as dimmable and compatible, I'm aware that CFLs and LEDs with digital circuitry usually won't dim as low. And the result was that the dimmer could not turn the puck\\-lights off. When the dimmer should have turned them off, they're still on at the lowest setting. No issue with the exact same dimmers as single\\-pole switches wired exactly the same for pots with LED bulbs. Maybe a minimum power draw issue?\n\nAnyway, I'm done rambling. Either I'm missing something obvious or this style of dimmer is to be avoided. Too many un\\-billable hours wasted.",

      "selftext": "Redirected from r/AskElectronics to here.\n\nHello r/Electricians,\n\nI recently moved into a new house that happens to be 4 years old (as far as I know) with both of my parents. My room is one of the 3 kids bedrooms that has a relatively small size, and recently has been the sole room to lose power completely. This has great effects on me considering I do much of my school prep work online and spend much of my free time with online entertainment.\n\nMy current setup of devices is as follows; 1 power strip with 2 devices connected being my 1080p monitor and 430W PC that I am currently writing this on, occasionally my Moto X included dual-usb phone charger, a very dim light connected underneath the charger for visibility at night and most recently a tv with cable box that remain unused connected to my wall. We have had 3 outages of power this month, everything going out in the room light included, and each being fixed by a simple reset on our fuse wall in the garage, particularly the one linked to this bedroom.\n\nI was told to include location, breaker type and it's rating/circuit voltage. Unfortunately, I am not allowed near our breaker presently and can only provide that I live in a suburban Texas, US home.\n\nMy step-dad tends to not believe I have any capability of fixing this issue at all and blames the 3 outages in this past month on my power hungry PC that I used daily. Thus I am adamant to do as much research as I can to get to the bottom of this issue, regardless of if he would let me apply proper solutions (I leave for college soon anyway so this isn't a huge priority.).\n\nMy question is this; Is the issue linked to the devices I have connected in this room with me being at fault, or is it rather more an issue with the infrastructure of the house wiring. I have been told by my very reliable friend that most houses have more than enough amperage to fuel my setup and much more. Also what potential solutions are available to solve this problem? Would editing need to be made to our house's wiring?\n\nThanks in advance and I would be grateful if you could post some sources that I can read through to further expand my knowledge of this topic, especially since I am going into computer engineering the following years.\n\nEdit 1: http://imgur.com/yWsvvEa\nhttp://imgur.com/LWmjML3\nhttp://imgur.com/I7nEyYR\nhttp://imgur.com/yUCwdcb\nLinks to the breaker switch photos.

      "selftext": "I recently installed a new ceiliing fan that has a built-in LED.  It's a Patriot Lighting brand from Menard's and specifies on the box that the light is dimmable with a compatible LED dimmer.  The unit came with a remote contol and receiver that allows you control the fan speed and the light color/dimness, and the whole unit is wired to a single pole switch.\n\nLast week, I purchased 2 dimmer switches, one for the light and one for the fan (links below):\n\nDimmer for LED: [https://www.menards.com/main/electrical/light-switches-dimmers-outlets/dimmer-controls/legrand-radiant-reg-450w-led-cfl-single-pole-three-way-dimmer/rhcl453ptcccv6/p-1452209500502-c-6321.htm](https://www.menards.com/main/electrical/light-switches-dimmers-outlets/dimmer-controls/legrand-radiant-reg-450w-led-cfl-single-pole-three-way-dimmer/rhcl453ptcccv6/p-1452209500502-c-6321.htm) \n\nSpeed control for fan:   [https://www.menards.com/main/electrical/light-switches-dimmers-outlets/dimmer-controls/legrand-radiant-reg-1-6-amp-de-hummer-single-pole-three-way-fan-speed-control/rhdh163ptcccv6/p-1458095303882-c-6321.htm](https://www.menards.com/main/electrical/light-switches-dimmers-outlets/dimmer-controls/legrand-radiant-reg-1-6-amp-de-hummer-single-pole-three-way-fan-speed-control/rhdh163ptcccv6/p-1458095303882-c-6321.htm) \n\nThe room is already wired with a single pole for a fan and two 3-poles on either side of the room for a light.  So my plan is to replace the single pole with the fan control, and replace one of the 3-poles with the LED dimmer.  \n\nThe fan unit has a memory, so with the remote control wired up, I set the fan to the fastest setting and the light to the brightest setting.  Then I rewired everything to the set up with the switches.\n\nThe result was that the fan with single pole speed controller works perfectly.  The LED dimmer on the other hand does not.  The best way I can descibe it's function is that it is touchy.  When I switch the power to the LED off and then on (from either swtich), the LED does not turn on.  But if I move the slider for the dimmer a bit, the LED comes on, and the dimmer function works (mostly) as it should.  I say mostly because there is a bit of flickering, but maybe it just needs to be calibrated.  Since this function is unacceptable, I took the LED dimmer out and put back in the original 3-pole switch (no dimmer function) and everything functions perfectly.  This is the current configuration for the past few days, and I've had no issues with it.\n\nSeemingly the issue is with the compatibility between the LED and the dimmer switch, but I cannot find any information on what switch would be compatible other than that the switch needs to be compatible with LEDs.  For good measure, I wired in a different dimmer switch that I had purchased for a different room in the house and saw the exact same behavior.  Does anyone have experience with an issue like this, or have any ideas how to solve it?",

As long as the wiring is done in parallel, usually line voltage wires are done that way. Also with the line voltage wires being a larger gauge then most low voltage applications you will have less voltage drop over a longer length, especially with DC voltage. It’s done all the time with low voltage DC voltage to run emergency exit signs. A lot of the time the bulbs are 6v DC usually running on #12 gauge wires to offset voltage drop.",

      "selftext": "My townhome is 18 years old and I bought about 5 months ago. 3 months ago, I posted here about my house sporadically losing partial power whenever my AC/furnace unit/blower would kick on or off. It was suggested that my house had lost one of the 120V lines coming in. I called the utility company, they came out and said the same and they fixed it.\n\nEverything was good until about a month ago. I started noticing lights dimming in various rooms. Along with that, equipment would spin up/down with the surges. Sometimes in the same room, sometimes in various lights and equipment in different rooms. \n\nAs examples, the hair dryer in master bathroom starts to spin down as kitchen lights dim. Also, lights/floorfan/treadmill spin up and down together in the same room. And last night, my bedroom table light and floor fan would spin/light up and down together...only major appliance running was dishwasher (which was displaying weird numbers on its display this morning instead of the normal 0:00 for time left).\n\nOther things I can think of were my kitchen lights and microwave spinning down and up at the same time. It seemed like I could restore them by switching on the AC unit...really weird stuff.\n\nAlso, I installed a new light fixture/chandelier last weekend. I put in smart LED bulbs and they buzzed and flickered. I replaced with regular LED bulbs and no flickering but still had buzzing. Ensured connections were tight. Could be fixture but I noticed my kitchen lights would sometimes flicker along with the new fixture and the flickering stopped when this fixture's bulbs were swapped.\n\nBasic research has suggested it could be an issue with the ground line on utility side. The utility company has come back, tested and not seen any issue and then installed a test device...but no word yet. I'm also looking up electricians to come out and investigate. Just wanted to post here first so I can have a little info going into my meet up with them.\n\nThanks in advance.",

      "selftext": "I hope it's okay to ask this here - I cross-posted to the r/lighting because I was't sure where the answer would lie.\n\nSo, I've had LED BR40 bulbs installed in my living room for years now. I finally decided to swap them out for smart LEDs because I love the convenience of being able to turn things on and off by voice, and most of the rest of my house is controlled this way now. \n\nI bought a set of 4 BR30 Teckin bulbs from Amazon (yes, they're smaller bulbs than my BR40s, but I don't mind the can being a bit less filled out) ([https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZFSW1YJ/ref=ppx\\_od\\_dt\\_b\\_asin\\_title\\_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZFSW1YJ/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)) and installation was going great until I put the 4th bulb in. For some reason, that last bulb made my dimmer switch start buzzing/humming. The switch was fine with 3 bulbs in it, so I'm wondering if it may be a bulb issue or if it's a switch issue. I don't think I'm overloading the switch (I mean, I'm not sure if that's really a thing - I know less than nothing about electrical wiring), since the bulbs are only 13w, which is way, way less than the 65w incandescents that I first replaced with LEDs, but I'm worried that it could be dangerous because electrical things shouldn't hum, right?\n\nAnyone had a similar experience or know what the issue might be? This is an old house built in the 50's, so the electrical wiring isn't the best to begin with (and there are no neutral wires, which is why I went with smart bulbs instead of a smart switch), so I don't know if that factors in as well, but again, the hum/buzz only began with the installation of that 4th bulb. \n\nThanks in advance!",

Have been through two different brands of LED bulbs and used two different brands for the dimmer, even though both dimmers said they were capable of dimming LEDs. Aside from that, but not as bad, all the other lights in the house flash also. Not as frequently as the dimmer fixture but still noticable. It seems to be distinctly affected by a major appliance running such as the washer or the heater. I hope somebody out there knows the solution to my problem that escapes my brain. I'm fed up.

      "selftext": "So this is going to be a long post but if anyone would have any ideas of how I can help fix this issue or troubleshoot the problem or lead me to the right subreddit to post this to get better help, that would be amazing.\n\nSo I've had my computer since August 2016 when I was in Japan. In the military so I lived in the dorms. I've never had any problem with power issues or tripping even when BitCoin mining was going on. \n\nMy system is a I7 5930k @ 4.3GHz 2x 1080ti FE 32Gb Ram 2x 1Tb SSD Raid 0 CPU, GPUs and MB is watercooled. CORSAIR AX1600i (Used to be a EVGA 1000Watt before as I was thinking might be something going on with the PSU or Powerdraw was getting higher when I was running overclock.)\n\nSo In Feb 2018 I moved to Maryland to my next base. I moved into a apartments and once in a while I get power trips. What I had going on was my computer, 4k monitor, Led lights around the room, Corsair Speakers, and my Samsung 65in curved Tv, and a small tornado fan to help sleep. Not everything will always be on at the same time but still occurs with the power trips.\n\nLater on my LEDs strip lights power brick would burn out so I wouldn't be able to power them. Then I had electrical technicians come by and check what is going on, so with the LED Strips not plugged in, they would give me the report the LED Strip lights are the issue. So its been a back and forth trying to get a proper evaluation whats going on, which never happened.\n\nI then moved in the following year, in March, 2 and half months ago. To a home I'm leasing in. The only thing different I have now is a 3d Printer. Along with having my laptop hooked up to it to control the 3d printer but the laptop is put into complete power saving mode and only remoted into to send print builds.\n\nSo nothing goes on for a month and a half and on the weekend and day before. I starting having the power trip. Firs time being that I was having everything off, they are plugged in but not turned on, But my computer and monitor I was playing Rocket League before going to bed. Then it happens. Then on the weekend playing CSGO, I was at the time having a 3d print going, and it happens. I flipped the switch on the breaker and stop the 3d print and go back into the game then power trips again. Now I went to unplug everything leaving my computer and monitor, and then flip and I was good but it ruined my mood for rest of the games we played cause it just baffled me what's going on.\n\nI do know a breaker for long use is only effected for 80% of its rating, so 15amps. That's 12amps for long use.\n\nHow can we just say my monitor and computer would consume over 12 amps.\n\nWith the current PSU I am able to monitor power going in (watts) and volts in as well. Last night while looking at stats for rocket league. Max power in pull was 550watts at 120V so that leads to 4.583 amps. The monitor I have is a 28in Samsung 4k monitor. That can't use much power either.\n\nI have also ordered two outlet watt meters, has V and Amps to read. So I can a basics of all power draw from different things being used.\n\nAnother weird thing is that at times I go home bringing my system with me to a friends and hook it up next to theirs and what ever they have running and never had a power issue.\n\nAnd if someone would be able to explain what kind of power draw would add up for something being plugged in but not On. I understand minimal power for say a standby but not full operative status.",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI have a nice modern vanity unit which I would like to fix up.  I've been having issues with this for years.  In the past 3 years, I've already replaced the ballast twice and it's now done again.  The unit works, but it takes a couple mins to warm up.  Basically, it's extremely dim and fully illuminates after being on for a couple of mins. I assume, the ballast unit is gone again.\n\nI was wondering if this can be converted to LED? Is it simple? Or is there a good ballast/light combo which would work well with my unit? The old ballasts which I've replaced were replaced with used ones bc I could never find any new, locally or online.  Even today, I still can't seem to find a replacement ballast for this unit.  Maybe the units were duds all along and on their way out...\n\nAnyone have any recommendations, either for good ballast units or an LED conversion idea?\n\nUnit: [https://i.imgur.com/zyVytw4.png](https://i.imgur.com/zyVytw4.png)\n\nBallasts:\n\nOld: [https://imgur.com/d498e255-84a8-467f-9df1-50f09c1273d3](https://imgur.com/d498e255-84a8-467f-9df1-50f09c1273d3)\n\nCurrent: [https://i.imgur.com/UFD6DuR.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/UFD6DuR.jpg)",

So if you know what bulbs you need and how many it should be fine to pick a ballast that matches your needs.\n\nI've never actually had to perform a Ballast bypass before, but if you know what you're doing you can also cut out the ballast altogether and convert to fixture to a standard 120v.  They make LED tubes that will function off 120, you just need to make sure the packaging says so.\n\nAll that said, if you're not confident in what you're doing it's best to just consider biting the bullet for something convoluted like this and paying an electrician to fix it up for you to prevent any unfortunate accidents.",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I‘m looking for some help with the wiring of a smart switch to control my porch lights inside a gang box that appears to have been mutilated by a previous owner, or in all likelyhood during construction of my 1976 bungalow.\n\nI recently removed a simple two-pole switch from the gangbox at my front door and replaced it with a FEIT wifi switch. Since replacing the switch I’ve noticed that the two LED bulbs that this switch controls,  which otherwise function perfectly, are always lit dimly, even if the switch is off. THIS IS THE PROBLEM THAT ID LIKE TO RESOLVE.\n\nWhen I removed the original two pole switch, I noted that every one of the ground wires in the gang box were tied together, as were all of the neutral wires. It seemed a bit odd to me, and I’ve come to find that it’s probably not the only location in my home with shoddy electrical work. \n\nSince the wifi switch required a neutral wire, I essentially added what I would call a jumper wire from the marret of bundled neutral wires and used this as the neutral match to the hot wire. (I think this might be related to my issue).\n\nI’ve also read that the problem could simply be that some LED bulbs don’t agree with this type of switch. I’ve included a half-assed, pretty pathetic ‘schematic’ of the gang box for reference, but if my description of the issue and wiring isn’t entirely clear, I’d be happy to try and clarify in the comments.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.",

      "selftext": "Hello all, I am looking for some insight on some issues I have recently run into at my home. I am waiting on the builder to send their electricians over to take a look at the issue and in the meantime I am trying to do some less intrusive trouble shooting my self. I recently moved into a new construction about a month ago with zero problems whatsoever. Fast forward to yesterday where I am sitting at my computer in my office room and I am suddenly hit with what I initially thought was a power power outage. \n\nThe lights in my office went off and my desktop shutdown, but I noticed that my desktop continued to try powering on along with the lights fluctuating from off to very dim. I shutoff the power strip and unplugged everything from the outlets and the light settled at ~50% of it's normal brightness. When I started surveying my house I noticed that my kitchen, dining room and office lights and receptacles were all affected (aside from any dedicated circuit appliances like fridge, microwave and dishwasher). I also noticed that my digital thermostats went off and the AC unit was unresponsive outside. \n\nI then went to check the circuit breaker panel and was surprised to see that none of the breakers had tripped. I began to try to isolate the fault at this point by seeing if any of the dedicated circuits on the breaker panel was causing these issues but I could not locate a specific fault and though at first I could get the thermostats to power on, it no longer turns on at all. \n\nAreas affected: Kitchen, Dining room, office room, and entrance hall connecting those rooms. HVAC as well. \n\nIndications I have observed: \n\n-When plugging a load that draws a larger amount of power (vacuum) into ant outlet on those affected rooms, the lights in the rooms flicker non stop and dim significantly.\n\n- Turning on the kitchen light will cause the brightness of any of the rooms to drop significantly but the other rooms have no affect on each other. \n\n- When the thermostat was initially turning on, I noticed that it immediately went black again after the dishwasher did its power up cycle. I am no longer able to get the thermostat to turn on. The AC unit also attempted to power on one of the times I got the thermostat back on but the ac unit was making a loud noise that I couldn't distinguish between if it was electrical or mechanical. \n\n- Any other room in the house is completely fine and has no apparent issues. No flickering or dimming lights, no problems powering bigger loads, nothing.",

The garage has power now, but just a single outlet and a few lights.\n\n[Here is an Imgur album with photos and descriptions of the the electrical boxes on the side of the main house, and one box on the deck that I believe powers the hot tub](https://imgur.com/a/mDUkG)\n\nThere is no panel at the garage.\n\nI was hoping it was going to be as easy as running out some new lines to the garage. Doesn't look like that. He informed that we only have a 100 amp panel at the house, and there simply isn't enough power to run out to the garage and power everything.\n\nI've done some internet reading about the difference between 100 amp and 200 amp panels, but I know so little about this, I'm kind of lost. Hoping someone can give me an ELI5.\n\nMy power consumption in the new studio will be fairly low.\n\n* Computer and a few monitors\n* Powered speakers, not very large though\n* Rack gear for effects\n* Lighting, mainly LED\n* Mitsubishi heat pump running on 220v (There's an in image in the photo album with the power specs)\n\nFor reference, all of that gear (minus the mini split) is running off a single power strip in my current studio (to avoid ground loop noise). Never had an issue with it in 2 years.\n\nThe power consumption at the house, I have no idea about. There are two medium sized A/C units, standard appliances. Heater, oven/stove and dryer are all gas.\n\nThe bid was as follows:\n\n* Upgrade service and panel to 200 amp - $1800\n* Wire studio room (280sqft) - $1500\n* Install 2 A/C disconnects at main house (code) - $400\n* Run underground lines to studio 70ft - $700\n* City permit and inspection - $450\n* ------------\n* Total $4850\n\n(Included in the wiring of the studio he will hang/install all the lighting fixtures.)\n\n\nEDIT: I received this reply from a non-electrian over on a studio building forum. Is there any merit to this?\n\n\"If you already have power in there im confused. Why cant he just swap the breaker for the lights, proabably a 20, with a higher breaker, say a 75 or 100, and where the feed enters the garage, put a breaker box with seperate feeds for all the receptacles and lights. Just use the original light spot as the supply. If the home panel has a under amped main breaker on the panel, swap it out. If not, then your meter is the 200amp fuse unless theres a disconnect somewhere else in the chain. Definitely get more bids. Contractors love ignorant home owners.\"\n\n",

You can't just swap the breaker out for a larger one unless the wire is sized for it properly, which it very likely isn't.  Putting a larger breaker in  could very easily result in a fire. Don't listen to any of their advice unless you're interested in having a house fire. As for the work you need done, I'd probably recommend a service upgrade to 200 amps as well. While you have several gas appliances, a hot tub+ 2 AC units and a mini split plus the other loads around your home is really starting to push the limits on a 100 amp service.  I can't comment on if the price is good as prices vary from area to area but I would advise you to get at least 2 more quotes from other electricians as well to know if it's fair or not.\n\n",

          "body": "When calculating adding on circuits you must calculate the total wattage of the appliances and devices in your house, anything over 1500 watts must be counted. There is of course exceptions and rules to how to calculate this all, but with a 100 amp service you don't realistically have a crazy amount of room. Hot tubs add a massive load to your house, so much that when we get calls to look at adding bigger furnaces and such, if we find hot tubs it is almost always a tell tale sign of being close. \n\nOften times people may add circuits despite your load calculations being over what it should be, which is most likely why you still need to upgrade regardless of adding new devices. You were probably already over the allowed amount and thus you will require meeting basic code rules before the licensed contractor would do the work.\n\nAs for the price, many things might need to be factored in (local laws and such can make this change greatly from province to province) such as feeding conductor size, meter base size, panel size, etc.. Typically in our installations we have had to contact the power supply authority and request larger service feeder wires leading to the meter base, the 100amp meter base would get swapped out for a 200, along with changing the pvc or conduit sizes to account for this change. Where I live the supply authority will cover costs everything on the supply side of your meter base(it belongs to them) but after that it's up to you to pay. \n\nSorry for the long ramble and I apologize if none of this is applicable to you and where you live, but I hope I might have helped you understand what might have been considered in the quote to have it be high. \n\nPs. 4500 for a service upgrade isn't really that bad in my opinion, I've been on smaller jobs of the same nature that cost more ",

Unfortunately he doesn't have a distributor for Mitsubishi, and I need a particular model because of it's noise rating. When he realized he couldn't get it for me, he suggested I buy it online and he'd install for a flat fee, $750. The unit is $1750, free shipping. I called Mitsubishi and they will honor their warranty as long it's installed by a licensed tech. The best HVAC bid I had for the same unit was $4500. \n\nEssentially he's saving me $2000 bucks on the HVAC. I don't think he'd honor the deal if I had someone else do the electric and asked him to install the mini split. So someone would have to underbid him by $2000, which I kinda don't see happening.\n\nAlso, I need an ERV for fresh air in my space, and he's going to install that included in the bid. I feel like overall the bid was fine, just wasn't sure I needed the whole panel upgrade and what that meant exactly. But you've set my mind at ease. Thanks!",

      "selftext": "We have a 120-year-old house with wiring redone maybe 15 years ago before we bought it. When we use LED bulbs, regardless of manufacturer, we have issues with them after a few months. Some will flicker, some just stop working. I assume the electronics are getting fried somehow.  It happens most often on lights that are turned on and off regularly, like the kitchen/laundry room.  Some rooms have not had any issues.\nThoughts: \n- the worst offender (kitchen) has two switches on opposite walls and appliances on the same circuit\n- second worst (laundry) has w/d and laser printer on the same circuit\n- we have an old 100-amp breaker box we are going to replace soon with 200 amp. The box is old and the cover doesn’t stay latched (we don’t get much rain here though).  Most of the breakers look fairly old\n- we have track lights with incandescent and one of the fixtures sometimes flickers but I assume that’s the fixture\n- We have some old-style knob dimmers in the house which tend to flicker and hum a lot with incandescent bulbs when turned down (we don’t use even “dimmable” LEDs on those lamps or they make horrible noises and light shows)\n- The microwave can make the incandescent lights flicker when they are dimmed\n\nThanks much for your expertise! Will bring your thoughts to my electrician.",

Before, me and my wife were sharing a room with our computers and we really didn't have many issues.\n\nBut since I moved my desk, I am now on a different circuit. When I plugged my power strip into the wall (holds captop docking station, two wide led monitors, headset, phone chargers) the AFCI tripped shortly after. The LED indicator said Arc Fault (not overcurrent). The tricky thing is, I hadn't turned anything on. In fact, it didn't trip during the day one time yesterday but when I came down stairs this morning the breaker was tripped again but nothing was on...my computer wasn't even docked so it wasn't charging.\n\nI am suspecting maybe my power strips are going bad or something. I have three total plugged in. I do have a large fish tank plugged into the circuit too. But it shouldn't use too much power.  Lights were off so it was using maybe 350-400W. Anyone have any ideas? I can probably get an electrician to come look for free from the builders, but I wanted to check here first. ",

You never know, it could be just coincidence that you moved your power strip recently).\n\nAs someone else suggested, start troubleshooting by disconnecting things and seeing what, if anything, makes the arc-faults go away.\n\nNote that I had a problem with a GFCI outlet where it would trip about 20-30 minutes **after** something had been plugged into the circuit and used. Turned out there was a loose connection, so as the wires/outlet cooled after use it caused the GFCI to flip. Maybe consider factors like that in your evaluation.\n\nAlso note that your docking station, and possibly the powerbar, are consuming power and contributing to the circuit even if your laptop isn't present. If you are going to rule things in/out then you should disconnect them completely, not just turn them \"off\"",

      "selftext": "Hi! Quick question & request for advice for you experts. Note: In Canada!\n\nTl;dr: how do I stop the dimmers in my apartment from making every kind of bulb produce a hum?\n\n\nMy computer power supply has been making an electrical hum. Thinking it was defective (coil whine) I exchanged it - long story short I went through 4 units all with the same issue.\n\nI then tested it at work, and found it operated quietly. So I knew the issue was with the electricity in my old apartment building - which was, nonetheless, redone ~ 5 years ago.\n\nI tested the outlet I plug the computer into and everything seems fine - the issue is also present on every outlet of the apartment, so it isn’t specific to that room. \n\nAfter doing some research, i found that dimmers are often a culprit of noise! I realized that the dimmers installed around my apartment may be related - especially since all the bulbs emit a similar “hum”!\n\nWhen I got home from work today I did a test - I shut off all the lights in my apartment and turned the computer on - no noise. Neato!\n\nI then turned on and dimmed the lights in each room and of course - each time the lights hum so does the computer.\n\nThe apartment mostly has LED bulbs (incl many led recessed ceiling light) and Maybe one or two incandescent bulbs...but all of them hum. So I’m not sure a solution would be to only use one type of bulb.\n\nAnd the alternative I imagined - replace all the dimmers...seems really expensive and I don’t think my landlord will pay for this if its only causing a barely audible hum.\n\nWhat do y’all think is the cause? And potential solution :)",

      "selftext": "Hey, completely uneducated homeowner here. I've been in my home for around a year, and recently upgraded my computer which led me to start paying attention to the fact that I've been getting 2 or 3 brownouts a day in my home. When they happen I lose power to my PC (if my PC is under load, if it's idle it stays on,) all my lights dim to 50% for a few seconds, then go bright after. So far, I've only observed it happening on one circuit, but it's possible that it's happening on other ones and I just haven't noticed.\n\nI'm going to call an electrician, but I want to at least have the slightest clue what I'm getting myself into. I used to do drywall for a (sadly now passed away, or I'd just ask him) electrician and enough of his work was undoing other people's shoddy work that I don't want to wind up being the homeowner in that boat.\n\nA lot of what I'm reading online seems to indicate that my issue likely has to do something with the grounding in my home being wrong. It was built in the last 5yrs, so I'm pretty confident my home's wired for proper ground behind the walls. I'm going to check if the outlets are wired right once the tester I ordered gets here, I know how to do that much, but if they are done correct.. What am I probably looking at?\n\nIt seems to be triggered by the PC being at high load while the sound system is at high load at the same time. The lights always dim, and then always come on strong afterward. With everything unplugged, the lights still do it on their own a couple times a day.\n\nIs a 15a breaker enough to power a gaming pc, a normal pc, a home theater audio system, two flat panel TV's, and two reptile heat lamps? I know it's hard to say, but am I on the right ballpark/planet? I have another circuit that's unused and only separated by a ceiling from the outlets I'm using, if it's possible I'm over-drawing. But I had future plans for it if not.",

It's moderately hard to merely lower the voltage on an active conductor, it would always be loow, and more often all or nothing. The neutral can sit dormant and provide a shonkey return path quit easily, it doesn't have the electron pressure that creates a potential difference. Could also be a backfeed on a neutral from another or same phase. \nIf you have 240 (or 120 in America) on an active, that is nothing but 240 compared to zero, if it can get to zero. If the neutral has 50V then the 240 to zero is actually 240 to 50 which in effect is 190 to zero. Similar if the neutral only allows 50v to flow, then your 240 is limited down to 50.\n\nFor it to be a brownout on an active conductor, it really needs to be extremely undersized, which can be a poor joint that in effect has an undersized window instead of full contact, but brownouts are not often on the active side of a load.",

      "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI am trying my best to replace an old shower light fixture with an LED fixture that goes flush with the ceiling. However, I am not an experienced electrician and have come into an issue where I don't see any ground wire. Included are three photos:\n\nPicture 1 [https://imgur.com/a/LicnsNx](https://imgur.com/a/LicnsNx)\n\nPicture 2 [https://imgur.com/a/T8vcbly](https://imgur.com/a/T8vcbly)\n\nPicture 3 [https://imgur.com/a/oEkcxGA](https://imgur.com/a/oEkcxGA)\n\nSo, I have those two wires. My first question. Should I assume the black is hot and the whiter one is neutral?\n\nIf so, I was told by an electrician that some old houses don't have ground wiring in their fixtures. So, instead, there's a metal box that you connect the light fixture's ground wire to. Is the metal box he's referring to the one in picture one that's up inside the wall and to the left? If so, do I just unscrew that screw that's visible, twist the new light fixture's ground wire into there, and then attach the other two wires as normal?\n\nIf so, that's not too bad, I just don't have access to the wire tips because I don't know how to remove that bulb thingy, so I wanted to use a wire cutter and cut them off before that other metal case and the bulb thing and then strip the wires down a half inch to tie into the new light fixture wires. Should that work?\n\nEdit: I am taking the advice /u/joedimwit and hiring out...despite the fact that he's a self-proclaimed dimwit. However, if anyone has a moment, I am still trying to learn as much as I can about electrical work. If you could explain to me whether or not my thought processes were correct, or if I am totally wrong, it would be helpful. \n\nI also took out the huge cylindrical canister because I assumed it was only meant to be there for the other fixture. Would I have had to install that along with the new fixture, or was that canister a part of the old fixture?",

      "selftext": " Looking for anyone who may have experience here with any lessons-learned.\n\nI've found too many of my light switches are not wired for neutral, even when I have 3 wires plus ground. I thought I could out-smart the smart-switch and figure out a mode where it could fake a neutral (needed for continual power to the wifi in the switch). I also understand how using a neutral from another circuit (but conveniently in the same gang) is a big no-no. So rather than wiring a neutral from the breaker to the (3-pole) light switch, another potential solution occurred to me and I was curious if anyone had done this.\n\nSince these switches are wifi, where they are located does not actually matter so long as they get a signal. It seems you could simply mount them a few feet away from the breaker and loop them into the circuit controlling the light switch in question, while adding a dedicated neutral for the smart switch. If you have more than one you could mount them in a row like the breakers, even.\n\n(Note: I do realize there are now smart breakers too - but I already have the light switches and these cost significantly less.)  \n(Note 2: I also realize there are wifi switches that do not need a neutral - they use a dimming feature to keep enough power for themselves when \"off\" - but these are also more expensive, and I have had issues in the past with LEDs that buzz with lowered voltage.)",

The main thing here is rather than running a neutral all the way to the circuit in question, you can limit it to between the breaker box and the wifi switch on the wall close by.\n\nWhat I was not sure about still is whether neutral is simply a line to the bank on the side of the breaker for the back flow to the transformer, etc.  I have always been OK doing wiring so long as I did not have to deal with the breaker box itself. \n\nThanks!",

I purchased this power supply... https://www.1000bulbs.com/product/99279/LED-M60L24DCAR.html?utm_source=SmartFeedGoogleBase&utm_medium=Shopping&utm_term=LED-M60L24DCAR&utm_content=LED+Drivers+for+24+Volt+LED+Tape+Light&utm_campaign=SmartFeedGoogleBaseShopping&gclid=CI_VtfHy3cYCFYpcfgodDjwMRQ\nThe switch I purchased was this dimmable lutron switch... http://www.amazon.com/Lutron-DVLV-600P-WH-600-Watt-Low-Voltage-Single-Pole/dp/B0006UUI06\nI created a cardboard mock-up of what I plan to do and set the whole system up. I have the dimmable switch wired into the power, then the power supply and finally the led strip set up in the room. The setup looks like this... (http://i.imgur.com/Kk76qmK.jpg)\nI noticed flicker when dimmed, and when fully on, I noticed slight flicker and when I move my arm it had this strobe effect. I thought maybe it was the dimmable switch, so I removed the dimmable switch from the system and just set it up to plug right into the wall. Still a flicker.\nNext I set up two 12 volt batteries together to make 24 volts and hooked straight up to the light strip. PERFECT! No flicker at all that I could notice.\nI don't know if there is ac current leaking through the power supply that is supposed to be converting to dc. If so, is it a bad power supply? Will any power supply I have give me this problem? Is it not true dc power unless from batteries?\nIf you can see an error I made calculating the parts to go together, please point out where I went wrong, and if so, please provide a better solution to help my flicker problem.\nIf you have any questions or if I forgot to include info, I'll provide what I can to help.\nAny help is greatly appreciated. Thank you\n\nEDIT: While shopping for a different led power supply I came across this unit.\nhttp://www.trcelectronics.com/View/Mean-Well/PWM-90-24.shtml\n\nIn the description, it says \"constant voltage\".  I'm not finding a power supply stating \"Full-wave rectifier\" within the description.  Might this power supply include a full wave rectifier?",

      "selftext": "Hey Folks, thanks ahead of time for your help. I'm a third year apprentice in BC, Canada, helping my folks with kitchen renos, and I suggested they get some under-cabinet lighting. I personally feel like the plug in strip lighting is kinda hokey so I am looking at hardwiring some stuff.   \n\n\nReally impressed with WAC Lighting, particularly their all in one dimmer/power supply that fits in a single gang box, but those are super expensive, so I am thinking we'll just go with this transformer ([http://www.waclighting.com/product/2789](http://www.waclighting.com/product/2789)) that I can pick up at a local supplier. Line voltage in, low voltage out, pretty straightforward. The one real question I have is whether I am correct in thinking that, as long as the LED strips are dimmable, that I can tie in a basic dimmer on the line side of the transformer and that it will dim the low voltage side proportionally? Obviously that's how transfomers work but I was unsure if it applied in this situation exactly, or if there is something I am missing. It says dimmable on the low voltage side but I'm planning on switching it on the line side, as one of the two branches of LED strips has three separate strips tied to one transformer and one switch.  \n\n\n&#x200B;",

I've tested it and the record player is dead, the radio still works and both speakers work. But the radio is only outputting sound to the right speaker. I am trying to isolate where the issue is, I think it is in the headphone jack, which is pretty loose. So I might remove it from the circuit entirely and see if that helps.     \n    \nSo my friend wants to put some led strip lights around the lid of this thing and add a Bluetooth receiver so they can stream music from their phone to the speakers. I have found some strip lighting and a few receivers that run on usb power. So my question is, is there someway or some component that I can splice onto the main power cable that has some usb ports on it that can run the new add ons and I can hide the usb ports inside the whole thing so it preserves the original look?",

      "selftext": "Hi r/electricians,\n\nHopefully you can help me with an issue I'm running into and I'm unable to find any information about it on the internet (I most likely don't know how to properly do the search).\n\nThe thing is I installed a two-way dimmer switch at home. The switch controls an outlet where I plugged a couple of floor lamps using an extension cord, so that I can lit the entire living room.\n\nI've checked the dimmer switch works fine by directly plugging another lamp with incandescent bulbs to the mentioned outlet. It even works fine with the LED bulbs from another lamp, if I directly plug them to the outlet.\n\nHowever, none of the bulbs will dim when I plug them using the extension cord. They will just lit up like normal. No matter what percentage I set the dimmer to, they don't change a bit.\n\nThere's nothing fancy about the extension cord. It's just a regular one I bought at Home Depot.\n\nI'm not an electrician, but I remember the basics from school.\n\nMy understanding is that every wire creates a resistance, so if anything the voltage should drop a little, and the bulbs should emit even less light when the dimmer is set to the minimum.\n\nI'm a bit confused about why this is happening, and I don't know if I should perhaps replace the extension cord for something more sophisticated, or maybe buy new bulbs that are specifically labeled as dimmable.\n\nHope you can help. Thanks.",

The cans are this brand Ecostar which my local hardware store started stocking and they're much cheaper than Halo so I picked up 6 and put them in the ceiling. They work fine unless I dim them down to say 1/3 of the max brightness which makes them flicker. They all flicker in unison and they've only started doing this within the last few weeks. Full brightness they are completely fine. Yes, they are meant to be dimmable according to the packaging. There's only 6 of them on the dimmer, hardly anything to fuss over I figure and I ran 12/2 to all the fixtures. I'm wondering if:\n\nA) The dimmer is going bad and needs replacing\nB) I cheaped out on lighting and these Ecostar lights suck\nC) something else entirely\n\nMy gut tells me something is wrong with the dimmer but I'm posting here in case someone replies with \"I've had those cans and they're garbage\" or similar. Thanks!\n\nEdit: so after a little research it seems as though the issue is in fact the cans. Ecostar isn't listed on the major lighting brand websites anywhere.

      "selftext": "I had typed this all up last night on my mobile.....and then the app crashed and I lost it before I could post.  It's long winded, I know.  But please bear with me.  I find that people often ask for help without providing all of the necessary information, so I'm trying to be as thorough as possible here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBasic premise:\n\nI have an outbuilding at the back of my property with 200 amp service from its own meter.  The building was built some time in the 1970s (from what I was told), long before the house or the rest of the neighborhood was built.  It would appear that the electrical service was updated when the house was built in 1999, as there is evidence that the old supply was fed overhead, whereas the new supply is underground.  Meter box looks modern, and the panel inside the building is modern as well.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe outbuilding consists of a 30x50 workshop with a two-story 22x28 \"apartment\" attached.  The shop is concrete with steel beams and roof structure, and all wiring inside appears to be THHN running through steel conduit.  A 100 amp breaker runs power to a sub panel in the apartment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile renovating the apartment, I discovered an old (unused and completely disconnected) black iron gas line above the drop ceiling in the lower level of the apartment.  The gas line runs along the floor joists of the apartment, though the concrete wall into the shop, up into the steel rafters, and over to an exterior wall where it is capped off.  I assume there was once a propane tank outside that supplied fuel to an old furnace that has been gone for many years.  It caught my attention when it arced against a metal support strap between two of the wood floor joist when I bumped it (up and off of the strap where it had been resting) with one of the ceiling panels.  When that happened, the lights in the apartment also dimmed.  Sharing that support strap in the same joist space was a 1/2\" copper water line that is also not currently in use.  That water line is actually fed  underground \\~170 feet by a by a 3/4\" pipe from the basement of my house.  The shop has its own septic system and used to have its own well, while the house is on city water and sewer.  The well was apparently decommissioned at some point, and the previous owner just ran a water line down to the shop when he was building the house.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince my house mains are grounded to the water pipes in my basement, this led me to think that my shop mains were chasing ground all the way back to my house via the steel structure of the shop (where all of the conduit is also making contact), down the gas line, and eventually to the strap that is touching the water line from the house.....not good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe PoCo installed new smart meters everywhere a couple of years ago, so I wondered if the installer they contracted messed up the ground wire coming up from the rod or something.  I went outside, and found the ground rod, and a piece of wire clamped to it, but it is cut about 6\" from that clamp, and I don't see anything it was connected to previously.  It's possible that the ground runs inside the conduit from the meter box then connects to the rod somewhere under the surface, but I doubt it.  It was also 15 degrees F, and I didn't feel like digging to find out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI found no other physical connection from the rod to any ground point inside the building either.  Only 3 wires enter the panel through the wall from the meter box.  Both hot legs and the neutral leg, but no separate ground.  This seems to be common with any other panel I've ever worked in.  As I understand it....the ground rod needs to be connected either at the meter box, or at the panel, but not necessarily both....right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway...thinking I was missing my earth ground connection, I killed the main breaker, put on my insulated gloves, and ran #4 solid copper directly from my ground bar inside the panel, to the rod outside under the meter.  I placed a leather glove between the water and gas lines and the metal strap they were sitting on to isolate the house ground path from the shop, then turned the main breaker back on.  Before turning any other breakers on, I checked the incoming lines and measured 123v on both legs to ground/neutral.  I then turned on the 100 amp breaker feeding the apartment sub panel, and checked the mains voltage again.  \\~160 on one leg, \\~80 on the other......not good.  I thought for a minute that the breaker was bad, but then went up to the sub panel, and killed the main shutoff there.  Remeasured at the main panel legs....back at 123v.  I shut off all breakers in the sub panel, turned the sub main back on, then remeasured at the main panel again.  No issues.  123v on each leg.  Same at the feed to the sub panel main switch.  But if I turned on any breaker in the sub panel that had a load, I'd get the same weird voltage split as I had at the main panel.  So.....I killed the 100 amp breaker feeding the sub, and started looking at the shop breakers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere isn't much currently hooked up inside the shop.  An old refrigerator, a battery tender, a Makita battery charger, garage door opener, a big exhaust fan, and the fluorescent overhead lights.  Nothing else was plugged into any of the wall outlets.  I figured it was best to start with the lights.  There are four 8' fixtures on each of 2 switches.  Each switch is fed from its own 15 amp breaker.  The two breakers are on opposite legs inside the panel.  I turned both light switches on, and then flipped one of the breakers on.  Lights come on, but VERY dim and flickering....like a 20 year old fluorescent with a flaky ballast tends to do when it's far below freezing temps.  This isn't normal for these lights.  So, I shut off that breaker, and try the other......same result.  Now I flip on the first breaker while the 2nd one is still on.....Instantly all 8 fixtures are on and at full brightness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt appears that ground isn't my issue.  And I suppose I shouldn't have assumed it was, considering the neutral is the normal return path, right?  So.....I'm now assuming I have a bad Neutral either from the meter box to the panel (less than 24\" of wires), or more likely underground from the transformer to the meter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've since turned everything off, and was getting ready to call the PoCo today while I'm at work and wait to deal with their shenanigans....but thought I'd bounce this off of you guys first.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny suggestions or advice is appreciated.  Also, feel free to ask for any additional information that I may have somehow left out........",

He popped the meter out, and installed some shunts and had me flip on the lighting breakers. Indeed.... Same voltage split I had noticed inside. He said the neutral is definitely broken somewhere before the meter. He put in a call to expedite the locators and underground crew. Hopefully I'll have some information tomorrow on when this can be fixed. ",

          "body": "Update #2: Underground crew came by Friday afternoon (unannounced, while I was at work) and didn't see any issues. Luckily, they rang the doorbell before leaving a door tag, and I was able to talk to them through the Ring app. I told them that the other guy said it was a broken neutral, and that the panel was switched off inside the shop, so there wasn't a load on the feed. \n\nThey thanked me for the info, and went back down to load test it, and do whatever else it is they do. The guy rang again sometime later to let me know that they found the break; but unfortunately, it was under the concrete. They informed me that a planner would be out sometime the next week to figure out what needed to be done as far as getting a boring crew or something in to do the fix.  They said they would run a temporary service line above ground for the time being. \n\nWhen I got home, I find that they had completely dug out and replaced the old ped, and ran 300ish feet of cable from the new ped to the meter on the shop.  They must not have had any big spools, as it's spliced twice on the way down the hill. Seems perfectly safe, right?  What really sucks, is they didn't do any sort of locating, and didn't even mark where the break is.... Nor did they provide me with any of that info. \n\nAnyway....planner calls today to inform me that the wire is direct buried, and that everything has to be inside conduit now.  He then informs me that the service to the shop is set up as commercial rate (must be from the previous owners, as I don't run any sort of business out of there), and that would make me responsible for all of the wiring past the ped at the street. \n\nHe said I can try calling the power company, and get it switched to residential (although he wasn't sure they'd do it), in which case they'd be responsible for the wire.... But getting the 3\" conduit trenched in from the ped to the meter would still be on me. \n\nSo..... Everything sucks. ",

Panel issue, or neutral issue.\n\nFind the circuit breaker that room is on and turn it off at the panel, then check what else is off all around the house...with the intent to map out which outlets and switches are on that circuit. Sometimes you'll find multiple bedrooms on the same circuit, and it's not uncommon to have them on 15 amp circuits. Mislabeled circuits in the panel are also not uncommon.\n\nOnce you know for sure what is on that circuit and what isn't. Try the humidifier on a different circuit. If you keep getting the flickering on more than just the led light across multiple circuits I'd call a reputable electrician to explore the issue and inspect the homes electrical system and panel box. It could be absolutely nothing to worry about, but it could also be a sign of an issue that needs to be addressed and corrected. With electricity it's best to be safe, and proactive rather than reactive.\n\nAnother thing you can try is running a vacuum cleaner on different circuits around the house to check for more flickering. Flickering itself can sometimes be completely normal and harmless. I.e. If they have the lights and outlets on the same circuit, flickering can be unavoidable. Flickering is only really concerning if its because of a neutral or panel issue.",

      "selftext": "Hello everyone. I just wanted to share my recent weekend project for the wife. I see most of the postings here are from pro-electricians, I’m just a handy guy that can strip wires and connect them together, so please go easy.\n\nWe turned a spare bedroom into an office so she could work from home. The room had no lights, not even power for a ceiling fan/light kit. We put a couple floor lamps in the room, but my wife told me the room did not have enough light compared to the office building she was working at and that her eyes were getting tired of looking at the monitors in the dimly lit room.\n\nI began planning what I would need and made a trip to my local Home Depot.\n\nThe job took me about 10 hours because I took plenty of breaks and because I was also trying to record everything. \n\n[Check out the video and tell me what you think](https://youtu.be/h6P8yYRIFmQ). I hope someone can find it useful.\n\n****Helpful tips I missed in the video:****\n1. Always flip the breaker off to the room you are working in. Wear proper safety equipment. \n2. If you are going to notch out studs like I did, remember to protect the wiring by putting a metal plate over them before covering them with drywall again. This will help to prevent someone from putting a nail through those cables.\n3. Double check your local codes and be sure to wire everything to spec and if the junction box has multiple taps for routing cable, be sure to use them, or wire up a bulk of cables in a separate junction box to avoid having so many cables tie into one.\n4. Use common sense. Electrical work is like math, there is one correct answer or in this case, one way things “should” be done and deviating away from normal practice could lead to you getting hurt or your property being damaged. \n\nDetails on the lights use: 4 pack of “Commercial Electric” brand. They are 6 inch LED lights with the option to change between 3000k, 4000k, and 5000k, which is the setting I’m using. They are 800 lumens each, drawing 12 watts per light. CRI rating is 90.",

All electrical new and to code.\n\nMajority of our first floor lighting (pots, island pendants, dining chandelier, etc) is on a single circuit. \n\nOur range hood fan has two LED lights built in. Clearly, the hood is on a separate circuit from the rest of the first floor lights.\n\nThe kicker is that when the first floor pots are dimmed and the range hood lights are dimmed, the range hood flickers (more like a consistent flashing). The hood flicker does not seem to occur when any other lights (pendants, chandelier, etc) on the first floor circuit are dimmed.  Just the pots.\n\nI should say that I have personally, after moving in, switched out a dimmer on our first floor circuit to an ELV dimmer to quiet some buzzing LEDs. I am no electrician. The dimmer I swapped was not for the pots though. \n\nThe flickering is really not much of an inconvenience because both sets of lights being dimmed to the  relatively narrow range in their dimming capacity that is causing issues is not something that is going to happen with any frequency. Lights from what should be two completely separate circuits messing with each other does have me a bit worried though.\n\nAny insights?",

I have a hunch on where the problem is, but not how to solve it.\n\nProblem: Flickering lights.\n\nThe main ceiling light (not original to the home, added sometime in the 90s I believe) flickers and dims sporadically. It has done this for some time now, but recently the issue has grown worse. Occasionally, the TV in the same room will turn itself off randomly. Like the whole room loses power momentarily. TV shuts off, cable box reboots, charging phones tone that they are being charged again, etc.\n\nSome context or things I've tested:\n\n - A friend who is in the Apprenticeship program was concerned about a wall switch possibly not being grounded properly.\n\n - The outlet the TV is plugged into is plugged in via a power bar strip. If the TV plugs directly into the socket, the TV buzzes.\n\n - The TV is a plasma TV (I know these draw more power).\n\n - Both lights on wall switches have dimmers. (main bedroom switch and ensuite bathroom).\n\n - All of the lights in the room flicker at the same time.\n\n - Lights will flicker even when the TV is off, but gets worse initially when the TV is first turned on. \n\n - I tried one of those Socket Detector things: https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61DBR47KyaL._SY355_.jpg and it didn't give any abnormal readings on all the outlets.\n\nShould I just kill the power and see about replacing the sockets and switches?

      "selftext": "Hello /r/electricians,\n\nI am in the process of doing a home remodel, and could use some advice from individuals who know what they are doing. \n\nRecently, I hired an electrician to install the wiring for an new kitchen install, and he setup the under cabinet lights as an hardwired instead of adding a gangbox inside the cabinet that would allow any string of lights to plug in and be routed underneath. \n\n[This is now what I am working with](http://imgur.com/a/zt7rl).\n\nThe problem is, there is no physical wall switch for this hardwire line. Not an issue originally as I was planning to have the same switch that triggered the kitchen lights trigger the under cabinet lights using Z-Wave. If there was a light switch for the had wired line I would just toss in one of [these](https://www.amazon.com/GE-Wireless-Lighting-Control-12722/dp/B0035YRCR2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1493489051&sr=8-1&keywords=zwave+light+switch) and be done, but alas, nope.\n\nNow that I am stuck with hard wire, I am looking for a solution that would allow for... well, any solution that would allow a zwave strand to be hard wired. Or, allow a normal strand to wired with zwave using a device like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Aeotec-Z-Wave-Micro-Dimmer-2nd/dp/B00IRI1CEK/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1493488784&sr=8-2&keywords=zwave+aeotec) or [this](https://www.amazon.com/Fibaro-Micro-Controller-Z-wave-Strips/dp/B00P1N68FW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1493489627&sr=8-1&keywords=zwave+led+light+strip).\n\nPossible to maybe splice the cord from a retail unit like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Aeotec-Aeon-Labs-Brightening-Atmosphere/dp/B01MRROSHG/ref=sr_1_31?ie=UTF8&qid=1493488804&sr=8-31&keywords=zwave+aeotec) to the hardwired line visa a junction box?\n\n[Use something like this in the line somehow?](https://www.amazon.com/Aeotec-Z-Wave-Micro-Dimmer-2nd/dp/B00IRI1CEK/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1493488784&sr=8-2&keywords=zwave+aeotec)\n\nI am open to ideas. Originally I was expecting to have a normal wall outlet, maybe hidden in the cabinets, and plug something [like this](https://www.amazon.com/Aeotec-Aeon-Labs-Brightening-Atmosphere/dp/B01MRROSHG/ref=sr_1_31?ie=UTF8&qid=1493488804&sr=8-31&keywords=zwave+aeotec) into it.

      "selftext": "Hello electricians,\n\nI've got a bit of a mystery on my hands that I'm hoping you can solve.\n\nI recently completed a complete studs-out remodel on my house which included a full replacement of the electrical system (all the 1924 KnT was removed and all wiring/panels/outlets/lighting is brand new).\n\nI installed LED lighting throughout the house; all of the bulbs claim to be dimmable (for A19, I've got https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CAL1LKO, for BR30 I've got https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014392H0O).  I've installed a the HomeSeer HS-WD100+ dimmers on nearly every light.  The bulbs claim to be dimmable; the dimmers claim to be LED compatible.\n\nMaybe it'd help if I describe the fickering that I was seeing; it looks almost like what you'd see from one of those cheap battery-powered candles.  In other words, it's not a steady flicker; it's not near 60Hz, much slower than that as I can clearly see it.  The light will get flash brighter then dimmer with a seemingly random pattern.  It's super annoying.  Now, I know that some flickering is common with LEDs and certain dimmers, but this issue is a bit more interesting than that.\n\nI've had cases where I'll have one light (for example, the single can light in my shower) set to a medium dim with no flickering, and then turn on another light on the same circuit (the adjacent closet, for example) also to a medium dim and they'll both start flickering.  If I turn one off, the other one will often stop flickering.\n\nI'm fairly certain I've seen this happening for lights on different circuits... that one seems stranger to me.\n\nThis morning, I was planning to do some investigation/note-taking to see if I could find any interesting patterns/combinations so I could reproduce it and talk to my electrician.  I COULD NOT get this to reproduce anywhere in the house despite being plagued by it for the past few weeks.\n\nMy line of thinking has now shifted to \"what's changed between the last few weeks and today?\" and I've got a few theories that I'm hoping to run by this crowd.\n\n  - The last few weeks were bitterly cold and very dry here (Seattle); this week has been warmer and wet.\n      - Perhaps there's an issue with my house ground where it's grounded better now that the soil is wet... they did have to dig up my sewer line right next to that grounding rod before I moved in, maybe it didn't get reinstalled properly.\n      - Perhaps because it's been warmer the heat system is running less often; maybe there's some noise being introduced by the circulator pump (I've got a hydronic heat system downstairs) or my minisplit (upstairs).\n  - Maybe when I ran my tests this morning the fridge's compressor wasn't running and it was on other days/times when I saw the flickering.  I can't think of any other electrical systems in the house that would have been running and introducing noise; the only other things plugged in are cell phone chargers and a Tivo.\n\nDo any of those theories hold merit?  Any other ideas?",

      "selftext": "Hi /r/electricians, hope you guys can help me...\n\nBeen having an electricity issue in my apt last few weeks, the  GFCI breaker (with test button) would randomly trip, despite not having changed anything in my electricity setup.\n\nHad maintenance look at it, and they took one look at my computer setup and said it was overload. I'm a nerd, so two computers, speakers, amplifier, 3 monitors, and router/lamps/modem/computer peripherals all plugged into a quite large tripp-lite power strip.\n\nHowever, I have a Kill-A-Watt meter, and recently tested the output of the computer setup and it peaked at 6.19 amps with both computers at full load. Hardly close to 15 amps which is what the breaker says. Now the apartment is very small, and I discovered that 6 outlets (2 plugs each) are all running on the 15 amp circuit, in addition to the overhead track lighting also on the 15 amp circuit.\n\nSo I also Kill-A-Watt'd the other things on the circuit and the new total comes out to be 8.05 amps, still though not close to the 15 amp limit listed on the breaker. Additional items on the circuit include, one box fan, one window fan, a couple lamps, some chargers, and a laser printer which I keep off unless I'm using it.\n\nI tested out my electrical setup on the 20 amp kitchen breakers, and everything ran fine. This apartment has 2 20 amp kitchen breakers and a 15 amp breaker for kitchen/bath lights, yet only one 15 amp breaker for the entire living room and lighting :(\n\nHowever, I still don't think this is a load issue, since the total of what I'm using is 8.05 amps on 15 amp breaker. The lights also on the breaker aren't calculated into that, but they are new LED lights and I can't imagine them taking up 4+ amps on their own (4 led track lights). Also, this issue only started happening a few weeks ago, and I did not change anything in the electrical setup.\n\nI am able to trip the power myself reliably every time by putting a load on my computer with a graphical stress test. It can take 10 minutes to trip once, but once it's started tripping it will happen more quickly after that. I tested 3 outlets on the circuit and 2 of them would trip quickly, and the third one seemed better and did not trip at all actually.\n\nSorry for the very long post, just want to get all the info out there. The apartment people are convinced it is a load issue, despite them clearly not having much electrical knowledge. They've offered to send an electrician out but they said if it's a load issue then I will have to pay for the electrician (wtf? I already told them I measured the power used and it's not close to 15 amps).\n\nPersonally I suspect that the breaker itself just needs to be changed. So, if any kind electrician has read all this, please let me know what you think... if there's any more tests I can do, etc. etc. Thank you!\n\ntl;dr: apartment power tripping, 15 amp breaker with test button all powering 6 outlets (2 each) and living room lighting, have 8.05 amps in total running on it not counting the LED track lighting. Can reliably trip power with graphical stress test. Problem only started in past few weeks, nothing changed with electricity setup.",

      "selftext": "So a couple months ago I had to contact the electric company because in the house the lights in every room got very dim (all LED light bulbs) and were pulsating. Turning something like the vaccum on would cause my cable box to reboot. \n\nThe electric company came out within an hour or two and the technician said he didnt like how tight the service line from the pole to the house was so he was going to come tomorrow and replace it but mentioned the issue is generally an open neutral. But he cleaned the connections and re-tightend and at that point everything actually seemed fixed, lights were normal, no dimming of the lights if I turned on the microwave. Cable box didnt reboot if the vaccume was turned on  anymore etc. And he came the next day to replace the line.\n\nNow all the sudden I'm at home, the only thing on in the house is the fridge, my 50\" LCD TV and TiVo, and my computer. However I the light is starting to dim occasionally in my room and the battery backup keeps clicking on as if there is low/no power.\n\nI'm wondering wth is going on, its been really windy here the last few weeks I'm wondering if that has anything to do with it and maybe the line out side again is being a problem. But it is also pretty hot (mid-high 90's).\n\nAnyways any suggestions or thoughts?",

I am somewhat handy and am up for trying to fix it myself but if its not easy am also fine with hiring a contractor.\n\nBasically I am just looking for an understanding of what the problem could be at this point and then what possible solutions are for that problem.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n The problem is that when the wall switch is flipped from on to off the 4 ceiling lights in the bedroom (in the USA) don't turn all the way off. They each have the glow of a pretty dim night light.\n\nI have not opened the ceiling light housing so I am not sure what kind of lights they are but I believe they are typical incandescent lights (not LED or something).\n\nI called the contractor that worked on the house and asked if that was normal and he said no. He came over and tried replacing the wall switch but that did nothing. He didn't seem super knowledgable but I am not really qualified to assess that.\n\nI opened up the wall switch later (after reading stuff on the internet) and I hooked the ground up to the switch because it was not hooked up before that. That also did nothing.\n\nHere are some detail shots of the wall switch innards just in case that is still relevant:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/udlijHA\n\nhttp://imgur.com/7hvA1Ef\n\nhttp://imgur.com/YZbvXcT",

First thing to check is whether a simple incandescent bulb does the same thing, or just look at it again after 5 minuites if you dont have an incandescent handy.\n\nThe usual culprit is a lighted switch that only has one pair of wires going to it. What happens in those cases is the switch doesnt have a real neutral to direct the tiny amount of power it uses to light the switch itself so it sends the power through the lighting circuit, which causes lights to glow slightly, or in the case of cfl and led bulbs with capacitors in them, flicker as the cap [dis]charges.\n\nBut, it doesnt look like you have a lighted switch, and it also looks like both power and a wire going to the the lighting circuit come into that box so there should be a neutral even if you did have a lighted switch.\n\nThe switch has been replaced, ruling out a partially failed switch. \n\nIf its not the slow cooling bulb issue, id start opening the lighting fixtures looking for circuits that have nothing to do with the lightng circuit.",

My question has been what power supply should I use to hook up to both ends? The next and most important question I have is can I hook up two 5m LED strips together then use the amplifier and use another LED strip or another two? Also someone mentioned that I’d need two 12v 5A power supply’s to run the LEDs and Amplifier would going with 24v 5A power supply’s be better or no? I have little to no knowledge about electrical stuff so this is why I’m reaching out to you great people! I’ll provide links for what Amplifier I’m buying and the LEDs I purchased.

The old can was the first can in a two can daisy chain from the dimmable switch. In the junction box of the old can, there was one wire coming into the junction box from the switch, one wire going out to the second can. Three wires of each color were spliced together (in, out, housing).\n\nAfter getting the wires into the new housing, I did the same thing using the push-in connectors (they had four holes and I could easily splice the three wire together for each color).\n\nI then mounted the housing onto the ceiling and put in a LED trim kit in the new housing (Halo branded). When I turn on the dimmable switch, BOTH lights in the daisy chain turned on in full brightness. I am sure the second light was dimming before I started this install. \n\nThe same was true after I removed the bulb from the new Halo housing and just had the second light in the daisy chain (which I have not touched) come on. It only turns on in full brightness.\n\nNot sure what went wrong here. Does it sound like I wired something wrong? Or, is this more likely to be a compatiblity issue between the dimmer and the Halo housing?\n\nWould appreciate any feedback on this. It took a surprisingly long time to get to this point.",

      "selftext": "My mom and I are moving into my Grandma's house until we can find a new apartment. The house was built in 1889, and no one knows when it was wired, but my grandparents bought it in the 1960s and the wiring hasn't had any major changes since then. There have been patch jobs here and there by random handymen and dubiously licensed electricians, but the last major change and inspection was 25 years ago. \n\nThe house has no grounded outlets, only 2 prong outlets, and it was wired before the popularization of RJ11 jacks, because all of the telephone wires are just stapled to the walls. The fuse box was replaced with a more modern panel 25 years ago but that was the only significant change that I know of. There is one three prong outlet in the house, on one of the three second floor bedrooms, but it's not actually grounded, it was either never grounded or the ground has somehow gotten damaged since it was installed. \n\nThere are two prong outlets in the bathroom upstairs and half bath downstairs (!), all 3 prong appliances just use those 2 to 3 prong converters. Fridge, washer, microwave, window AC, lifting chair for the elderly, all run off of the converters. There are few outlets, so when more are needed (ex: christmas) they plug a converter in the socket and a power strip in the converter and then plug what's needed into the power strip. You can't use a hairdryer most of the time, otherwise the lights dim and eventually the circuit breaker trips. \n\nThe current situation is dangerous as it is, but it's just my grandma living on the first floor, she can't go upstairs anymore. But it's about to get a lot worse, with two of us moving in to the upstairs. I have a 620w PSU in my computer, my mom has a laptop, we're going to have a microwave upstairs, we both use hair dryers, and we're going to need two more window air conditioners. The wiring hasn't ever been stressed like it's going to be. \n\nIt scares me that the house has had god knows how many shoddy patch jobs. Some handyman installed a bathroom fan in the upstairs bathroom a few years ago, and he complained that the wiring was \"falling apart\" and that he had \"never seen wiring this old before\". Even still, he went ahead and did it. \n\nI'm trying to convince my mom to pay for a full, thorough inspection by an electrician who specializes in old houses or problem houses. I know that there must be some really fatal errors in the current wiring, but my mom just brushes me off saying 'you aren't an electrician', 'it's worked this far, it will keep working', 'i lived there until I was 22, it's fine', and, most aggravatingly, 'if they do find dangerous problems, who has they money to fix it?'. I countered it with saying that it's a lot cheaper to rewire the house than it is to rebuild it, but she didn't really seem to care. \n\nWhen they do find expensive to fix issues (I'm going to assume they will want to rewire the whole house), are there ways to mitigate the cost of rewiring? My grandmother is 86 and she qualified for spray in insulation a couple years back because she was an elderly homeowner. Failing some sort of government assistance, is it possible to keep it cheaper by running the wire in conduit along the walls instead of making holes in the plaster and running it back there? It wouldn't be pretty and would probably tank the resale value a bit, but we don't plan on selling once she dies, we plan to move in and fix it up. \n\nAnyway, my questions are:\n\n**Any advice for convincing my mom that this ancient wiring needs to be looked at by a professional?**\n\nand\n\n**Can the cost of rewiring a house be mitigated with subsidies or by compromising on aesthetics?**\n",

I partly agree with the other poster who said you do put yourself and your family in a situation with increased legal liability. \n\nBased on what you have told us, the most serious issue is using 2 to 3 prong converters and 3 prong receptacles where you have no ground. I would immediately rectify this problem using gfi's (this is something you can probably do yourself).\n\nThe other issues you described are problems but aren't inherently dangerous.   Overloaded circuits are a concern but as long as your panel hasn't been modified since your inspection you should have no issues. \n\nSo in short: ideally your wiring should be inspected and brought up to modern code. (I sort of agree with your mom here). 3 prong receptacles should only be used where you have a gfi or a ground wire.  Generally you can skimp on aesthetics for less cost, but I probably wouldn't suggest employing any contractor willing to make that compromise.  As for subsidies, usually only when it comes to making your home more \"green\". ",

There are also 2 additional light switches (non-dimmer) that can shut these lights off. \n\nPreviously, I had just regular old bulbs in my setup with no issues.  Dimmer worked fine, no issues. I tried to install the first new bulb and everything was fine, the new LED smart bulb worked perfectly.  As I removed the 2nd old bulb, the smart bulb went dark. No luck when the 2nd Smart was installed either. In short, 1reg/1smart = works, 1 smart = doesn't work, 2 smarts = doesn't work.   I tried putting plain  non-smart LED bulbs in (worked completely fine) and had the same situation when i tried to switch them out for the smart bulbs.  Not sure what is happening, any idea?\n\nI did try the two Smart bulbs in two different areas of my house one with a dimmer and one without and had no issues. Is it worth returning these and trying a different brand such as the Phillips Hue?\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/PeeIN",

It likely leaks a small amount of current through the bulbs to work properly and was fine when there was still an old bulb in there to leak through but now that it's LED bulbs there are issues. Replace with a standard switch and you will be fine. Also using them with a dimmer you run a high risk of wrecking them as they are not designed to be used like that.",

I tried plugging the battery backup into a few other outlets, and found some which indicated a wiring fault, and some which did not.\n\nWhen I used a circuit tester, all of the outlets *seemed* fine at first, although the suspicious ones were slightly different.  For example, the kitchen outlet revealed a Building Wiring Fault from the backup UPS.  The circuit tester lights up the two orange lights, revealing a correctly wired circuit, but then I noticed the third red light was ever so slightly dim (I first thought it was just light spilling over from the center LED).  When I pressed the GFCI Test button, the light on the right went out, and the red light lit up in full.\n\n* Bad Outlet [PIC01](http://imgur.com/9rwrjzP)\n* Bad Outlet (with GFCI Test button) [PIC02](http://imgur.com/x0DsfEN)\n\nI also tested one of the good outlets that didn't indicate a fault from the UPS.  Here the two lights lit up clearly to indicate correct wiring, and I noticed the red light was not lit at all (although it's kind of hard to see in the photo, it wasn't lit).  Also, when I press the GFCI Test button on the good outlet, nothing changed, the two lights remained on indicating correcting wiring, and the red light stayed off.\n\n* Good Outlet [PIC01](http://imgur.com/hM7umIm)\n* Good Outlet (with GFCI Test button) [PIC02](http://imgur.com/q68NDlZ)\n\nI live in an apartment, and will call my property manager to let him know, but wanted to arm myself with as much information about the situation to help explain the issue.  \n\nWhat does the GFCI Test button switching like that indicate on an outlet that does not have a GFCI?  Is there any way to determine what type of fault exists based upon what I have described?",

I've ordered the plastic screw terminals and will be replacing the wire nuts once they get here. Now for the follow up:\n\nI'm using 18 gauge wire for about 20 LED lights spread over 60'. Each light is a 3-5 watt LED, all daisy chained to a 200 watt power supply.\n\nIt looks like this:\n\nPower ===//===//===//\n\nThe = is an 18 gauge, and the // is the splice with a VERY thin wire that goes to the light. The problem is that the two pieces of 18 gauge are very fat, and when the thin wire from the light goes in, it can get lost. I've made the strips extra long to compensate.\n\nAnyway, since these are LED, should I go with a thinner wire from the power source? I know with the older patio light units, heat would be an issue. I don't think that's the case with the LEDs. \n\nEdit: Forgot to put in the original link!",

      "selftext": "Since we moved into our new 1960s-era home last winter I've been chasing odd electrical issues. Some were caused by overloaded or combined circuits, others caused by shitty junctions, but a few lingering issues seemed to be starting from the supply side. At night time I'd get a 8-10v spread between my two phases. My vacuum would even sound noticeably different depending on where it was plugged in. I ended up having Duke come out where they found my neutral wire frayed, but that still didn't seem to fix the voltage blips. Any moderate power draw device would cause LEDs in the house to flicker. 1000w smoker, microwave, AC condenser, etc would all make lights dim for a split second as they turned on. Decided to live with it up until I ran into an Ops Tech at work and bounced my residential question off of him. Way overkill for someone who deals with grid layout and substations, but worth a shot.\n\n\n\nDude ended up coming over to check out my house while I was at work, paced out the service drop and started looking at how the poles were configured in my neighborhood. He ended up finding out that the original neighborhood layout had me connected to a pole with a transformer >300 ft away from my house, which was loaded up with 5 other high-draw houses. \n\n\nhttp://imgur.com/zR6MUul (I'm the corner lot)\n\n\n\nHe also realized I have a pole directly across the street on the other side, with a transformer serving only 2 houses. After a meeting with a project coordinator my service drop is pivoting to the other street. For now its staying 100A, but this should take care of my off-balance 120V legs and odd voltage drops in evenings as other houses ramp up there loads. ",

      "selftext": "Hi Electricians!\n\nI'm creating a prop for a video and i need to hook up a series of LED lights. I have virtually no experience with LEDs. I'm good soldering, but i know there is a concern with LED's and resistors, which is the part that i don't quite grasp. I have 2 different LED's that i'd like to hook up to a wall plug. I could hook that easy enough, but i'm worried about blowing my lights out.\n\nI have one LED (A) that says \n\"low LED amp draw\" \n\"operating voltage of -12V.\" \n: http://www.ebay.com/itm/BRIGHT-3-4-RED-LED-CLEARANCE-MARKER-LIGHT-FOR-TRUCK-TRAILER-/121699840620?_trksid=p2141725.m3641.l6368\n\nThe other is an LED (B) strip that says it has an \n\"Output power: <12W / Meter.\" \n\"Working Input Voltage: 12VDC.\" \n\"Working Current: ,1A / Meter.\" \n: http://www.ebay.com/itm/5CM-1-2-3-4-5M-Non-Waterproof-Red-5050-Flexible-Strip-3-60-120-180-240-300LEDs-/161411290761?var=460435456118&hash=item2594dcd689:m:mLlWTPoj9HGzcRp4ZwweXAw\n\nI'm concerned about combining LED A with LED B and running them out a wall. I see that B needs a Direct Current and I believe a wall socket runs AC. What issues that creates? I'm not sure.. And how to fix it, i don't know.. What resistors and wiring configuration do i need to make this a safe and working circuit?\n\nTrips to my local stores have given little help as stores replace knowledgeable employees for lower wage workers. Online searches have made me feel completely overwhelmed probably because i hardly know where to begin so i'm asking for help on reddit because it's a vault of knowledge.\n\nAny help solving A + B -> Wall =? would be vastly appreciated. \n\nThanks!",

      "selftext": "For my biology project, my group decided to create a solar powered water fountain. This is the biggest school project I have ever done, so before we finalized everything, I wanted to make sure that we have the electronics of the fountain 100% correct. We have a total of $400 to create this fountain (the money is part of a grant) and our idea was to spend about $200 of it on all the electronics needed (pump, solar panel, lights, wiring, etc). Because we are receiving this money, I am nervous that something that I had planned won't work, and there is also some stuff that I am just not sure on. I have included a [Google Drive Link here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B5ymHIV9QWGzQzVrZ2dRR1BQSFk&usp=sharing) that includes renders of the fountain, wiring layouts, and a sketchup file.\n\n- For the solar panel we were planning on getting [this](http://www.amazon.com/ECO-WORTHY-50W-Polycrystalline-Solar-Panel/dp/B011I6T5VE/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1449241519&sr=8-4&keywords=50w+solar+panel+kit) solar panel+solar charge controller combo on Amazon. When I first decided this the panel was still in stock. We liked this solar panel kit because the wiring was pretty much already done for us, it included alligator cables, and it was priced competitively at $100. Because this solar panel combo kit is out of stock we thought about [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/50W-12V-Solar-Panel-PWM-10A-Charge-Controller-Regulator-RV-Marine-Kit-50-Watts-/121717760164?hash=item1c56f1a0a4:g:hSEAAOSwDNdVxRhd) solar panel+solar charger combo kit. The only downside to this kit is that the alligator cables are not included and already plugged in, so we ware planning on buying [these](http://www.ebay.com/itm/10pcs-Double-ended-Test-Leads-Alligator-Crocodile-Roach-Clip-Jumper-Wire-hg-/271687369178?hash=item3f41d441da:g:isoAAOSw~bFWQGuz) alligator cables. This leads me to my first question. Is it okay to strip off one of the ends of each of the cables so that we can fit them in our solar controller? And are these the right types of cables?\n\n- For the battery we were planning on getting [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/121188394888) 12v 18ah battery. My questions for this is, is it enough capacity? Is this okay to use with solar power?\n\n- For the pump we were planning on using [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/281514346847?_trksid=p2055119.m1438.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT) 1ah pump. We are planning on having the pump go 24/7. I have questions on wiring it but I will have a separate place where I ask all of my wiring questions.\n\n- Our group is planning to use [these](http://www.ebay.com/itm/301731310528) lights. (we selected the \"3w COB Light with rod option\" with \"ac/dc 12v\"). We just want the light to turn on at night, so I had planned to use a light sensor to turn the light on an off. After realizing that there are dim lights above where we want to place the fountain at night that would interfere with the sensor, I decided that it would be best to use a timer. We are planning on using [this timer](http://www.ebay.com/itm/DC-12V-16A-LCD-Digital-Display-Power-Programmable-Timer-Relay-Switch-for-Light-/111651878075?hash=item19fef874bb:g:hVYAAOSwxH1UCm81). I don't really have any questions with the light, I just wanted to post it here to see if someone else found something wrong with it that I didn't.\n\n- I want manual on/off switches for the pump and lights just incase something needs to be manually turned off. My first question is: do I need to get switches made specifically for dc applications? or will any switches work? For some reason I had the hardest time finding basic DC on/off switches, Pretty much all of the dc switches that I found were designed to be in cars and had leds on them. Also, all of the switches had 3 pins to connect wires to, which I have no clue why. I feel like I am definitely missing some important info on switches because of all of these questions. I think I found a basic switch [here](http://www.delcity.net/store/Wedge-&-Duckbill-Toggle-Switches/p_789150.h_789151.t_1.r_IF1003?mkwid=sn9z2rJCm&crid=38094426869&mp_kw=&mp_mt=&gclid=Cj0KEQiAv5-zBRCAzfWGu-2jo70BEiQAj_F8oDlOKqsphV6k6cdVCDSMf190T-jNYkgVYD5cJuxuMJ4aAq4P8P8HAQ). One question that I have about this switch though is that it only has 2 pins? I would think that a switch would need 4 pins, 2 for positive and negative input and 2 pins for positive and negative output. Again, I am just generally confused with switches.\n\n- Now for the most scary part of this whole thing, wiring. In the beginning of the post, I included a [google drive link](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B5ymHIV9QWGzQzVrZ2dRR1BQSFk&usp=sharing) that has an image called \"Wiring Plan.png\" please reference it to get an idea of what I am talking about (I am a noob to wiring so I hope you can kind of understand what I am talking about). I was planning on using [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/271217863185?_trksid=p2055119.m1438.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT) wiring. Is the wire thick enough? and will it be able to fit in the solar charge controller? My next question has to do with soldering. I would really like to avoid soldering because we don't have a soldering kit and we don't have *any* experience with soldering. I was hoping to use the \"Electrical Tape Method\" found in [this guide](http://www.instructables.com/id/4-Ways-to-Connect-a-Wire-Without-Soldering/). Is using electrical tape a good idea? Or will I end up *having* to solder wires together.  I also am not sure how to split the wires to connect the dc water pump and the timer that goes to the lights. (the first switch will be in between the splitting of the wires and the pump, the 2nd switch will be in between the split of the wires and the timer). Also, these wires will be outside, in the rain. I also plan to use [this tube](http://pages.ebay.com/link/?nav=item.view&id=161379245606&alt=web) to protect the wires for the pump and light to the solar charge controller and battery. (see renders for details)\n\n- The last thing that I want to say is thank you for reading this whole thing. Feel free to tell me anything about what is wrong, right, or just weird. I have spent sooo much time researching this type of stuff, and I am actually having fun. I hope to someday go into electrical engineering because I am really enjoying this project.\nExtra info: with all of the things listed, the total price of the electrical side of things is ~$190 out of the $200 budget for electronics for the project.",

Typically I’d use a standard led driver with a 24v led strip but I’m concerned about 1) voltage drop and 2) overloading the dimmer.  Lutron makes a 250W LED dimmer but I believe you need to de-rate if in a multi gang box.  Haven’t had to run this many watts of LED strip lighting on a single switch before.  \n\nAny recommendations for either 120v tape lights or a setup I can run off a 0-10V dimmer?  \n\nThanks in advance!",

The starters can go back to the same driver though. Their blaze series shows a max run of 55 feet on the 24v system. I didn’t look at the rest of their stuff. I sold them for years and like the product. They also have some cool dimmers with the driver built in so no need to hide a driver but I don’t think those are enough for your application. You should check them out though. Nice stuff and the website has layout assistance.",

I find this strange because the toe kicks on the wall cabinets and thr island oprate off of the same slider dimmer (14/2 switchleg from the dimmer up to an outlet in the attic, and another 14/2 from the attic outlet down the kitchen wall, under the slab and up into the island where it terminates to another plug). The wires in the attic are tied through and pigtailed to the outlet. I tried reolacing the transformer, and using a new LED strip, no dice. Am I missing something here? ",

I read somewhere that the aluminum channels would distribute the heat better. What do you think?

      "selftext": "I have an [\"open staircase\"](https://imgur.com/a/x6wxZXb) with 7 treads and I want to put led strips under each step's nose. I have routed a channel under each step and inserted an aluminum track that will house the strips. I also have wires running to each tread.  Based on my research so far the plan is to feed all the wires from the LED strips to a \"driver\" (power supply) and power the driver via standard 110. I want to make sure that I get the correct driver that will be able to handle all 7 of the stairs and to avoid any issues.  \n\n  These are [the light strips](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075L4M9BJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) I am looking at purchasing   \n\n  Per the info from their page each of the LED  \\~150mw each (0.165 watt). I calculated that each stair will have \\~63 LED \n\n  63 x 0.165 = 10.395 per stair\n\n  10.395 x 7 Stairs = \\~73WT for the whole set-up\n\n  I have [this driver](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06Y23JJZW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) laying around but its rated for 400wt. Is that overkill for my purposes? My concern is  with the fan noise on the driver. Its fairly loud and since I plan to keep it inside a wall in [an enclosure like this one](https://www.amazon.com/Q-EN1400-14Inch-Enclosure-ScrewOn/dp/B001BAYHX4/ref=sr_1_15_sspa?crid=1AHFZ54V0VVUZ&dchild=1&keywords=media+enclosure+box&qid=1595210262&s=hi&sprefix=media+en%2Ctools%2C228&sr=1-15-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzMEU0R1g2OE9aUTQ0JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUExMDQ0NTQ4M0haV1RJN1RKSDRSSiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNDc1MjQyMkg4MUoxWVNaU1ZSTSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX210ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=) I am also worried about possible overheating issues if there is no circulation. Is there any negatives to using a larger-than-necessary driver. Will it negatively impact the longevity of the strips or create other hazards? \n\n  If so, how big of a driver should I actually get for my set-up? Am I on the right track with this whole plan? Any other advice or possible concerns is greatly appreciated. Thank you all in advance.",

So far I was using 12V power supply with a cord, but now I'm looking for a solution to power it directly from wall wires (220V) like normal lights.\n\nThe problem is that I want to make electric stuff fit inside a lamp so when someone wants to install it, they would just need to connect the wires and be done. I'd be using from 50cm to 1m of strip depending on a lamp so 10W power supply is needed. I was looking for so long and the smallest 10W power supply would be 58x25mm [https://imgur.com/SdU0d45](https://imgur.com/SdU0d45)  which is like 2 times too big to fit in. Are there any smaller power supplies or is there any other way to make it work somehow the way I want it? \n\nI know there are 220V led strips that would do the work but unfortunately I couldn't find flexible ones which I need.\n\nIf there is no way to make it work with a 10W strip is there a way to make it happen with 4,8W strip, so 5W. I found a power supply 1-3W which is way smaller and would be great [https://imgur.com/QYP7RDu](https://imgur.com/QYP7RDu) but it's still 3W max which is to low.\n\nOr maybe using led strips isn't the right solution but I haven't found any other because I need a strip of light rather than a bulb.\n\nSorry if I'm messing up some terminology, I'm not a native speaker and I have little knowledge about electric stuff.",

      "selftext": "Hey guys, I need to convert a Christmas LED light strip to portable, with and apply a switch.\n\nThe LED lights work on 230 wall outlet and have a transformer attached originally.\n\nMy plan is to cut it out from the transformer, attach a switch and attach the end of it to some kind of battery. How do I find out what battery do I need for this?\nI bought a 3r12 Varta battery, and I cut the line and tried to see if it lights up with it. Unfortunately it doesn't, however the lights still work if I reattach it to the original line and plug it in.\n\nThe only text on the transformer says ACmax. 2A=480W DC. I was unable to find any other information about the transformer, even the website of the vendor just says \"you can plug it into the wall\".\n\nIt's 5m long (about 16 feet 5inches) and has 50 LED. The note in it says the following:\nRated voltage: 230V 50Hz\nRated power: 4.6W\n\nI'll try to provide any other information, feel free to ask in the comments.",

          "body": "Looked up 3r12, 4.5V DC. Usually the transformer states the dc output in volts. That’s your target. I’m hoping it uses far less current because you’ll run through batteries quick if it is 480W (more likely the rating of the transformer not the output).  I am guessing, a 12 Vdc would get the LEDs to light up. You’d need 3x 3r12 in series to get to the 12 volts. \n\nBe safe, but you might be able to put a volt meter on the outputs of the transformer and get a DC voltage. But I’d be surprised if it didn’t have that value listed on the transformer or the manual for the LED lights.",

The strips will be running in the bottom of each shelf with a valence hiding it.\n\nI've done under cabinet lighting with huge valences accommodating 1110's to marette the driver end to the switch leg.

I said B option because that is parallel wiring where as A was series wiring which is not code complaint for line voltage circuits. In the picture he wrote that the bulb responded perfectly in standard parallel wiring so I mentally ruled out a switch loop as to not confuse because it was ruled out already via the information given. I am aware that it is always something to consider, but respectfully have to say that a switch loop is not being used in this scenario. I continue to stand by my presented explanation, as well as I would like to state that while being an apprentice, I am perfectly capable of understanding basic line voltage circuity and other matters in the electrical field.

I bought a vinyl gutter, installed metallic foil tape on the inside and installed a LED strip in it. It is bright but not as bright as my original fish tank. My original fish tank came with a hood light that has 4 small LED panels with 3 integrated LED lights in each panel. They are small but they pack quite the punch and even work on my new fish tank but they only fit my old fish tank. I have tried about 3 different LED strips from Amazon but they do not brighten up the tank compared to the original LED hood. Is the the type of LED that I am buying? Because the LED strip hood I made has over 50 LEDs compared to the 12 LEDs on the main tank. Where can I get daylight bright LEDs from? \n\nHere is the original tank hood LED \n\nhttps://www.chewy.com/aqueon-led-15-column-replacement-hood/dp/206060?utm_source=google-product&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=12789772272&utm_content=Aqueon&utm_term=&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIgqbPjZjc9QIVygeICR1OaA0mEAQYBiABEgJHEvD_BwE\n\n\nOne of the few strips I got from Amazon\n https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FQDT1VV/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_i_NHVTAMVJ1QEHSDX7VNDG?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1",

This can easily double your labor costs. \n\n5. Usually when a customer buys materials to save money, they probably would have saved more by asking us to pick the best lights. Why? Because well pick lights that are easy to work with and fit the application. Maybe you bought lights that every single one needs to be altered to fit where it's going. \n\n\nI can keep going but these are several big ticket items that you can't even get into the ballpark of before you figure it out. \n\nPut it this way though, each laborer should be $180-$1,000 per day. Plus materials and overhead. $180 being on the low end where guys don't speak English and don't wear safety shoes and have tools from Walmart. $1,000 is probably for an outfit that owns their own lifts, super clean and professional, they probably offer a wicked warranty, they probably have some smart and good electricians working there. \n\nMaybe the workers aren't making that much but that's what boss man should be charging for each guy. \n\nSo if you have 3 guys who take 2 days to do it, you could easily be looking at $1,500 - $10,000 in labor and equipment rentals.",

Is a skyjack/scaffolding required?\n- What is the brand/model/serial number? So the installation method is known, and can be costed accordingly.\n- Is the location easily accessible? (Will the electrician need to move a bunch of stuff out of the way to get the lights in?)\n- Are they 100% the correct lights? Are they UL listed, approved for installation in the manner you're hoping?\n- Who is responsible for disposing the old fixtures?\n- Are you looking for a quote, or pay for an hourly rate?",

The wiring from the transformer to the light strips would likely be 18 gauge or similar.\n\nWhat throws me a little is that if this is all pre-planned, then would a proper installation try to have the 120v->12v (or 24v) transformation done _before_ the switch? I have heard that many dimmers aren't well suited to dimming LED strips and while there are many products out there that can work around the issue (Magnitude transformers keep popping up), the fact that it needs to be worked around suggests that maybe there is a better way if _everything_ is new?\n\nAnd yeah, the ceiling LED lights are going to be installed in an aluminum track with a diffusion cover over it, with the goal of have as even a light source as possible. The shelf lights will either have the same or maybe even a dedicated \"under cabinet light set\" if I can find one that does custom lengths.",

It’s powered by 12 volts. And has a Bluetooth receiver to control the lights on my phone. \n\nThe problem right now is that the led strip is not displaying any REDS. It displays a yellowish color or a white color whenever red, pink, or purple is selected. I have tested the strip with a different non Bluetooth receiver and the tapes do display all the colors without an issue. \n\nAll the colors were originally displaying correctly. Until I started cutting the strip along the dashed line. I’m pretty sure the issue is with the Bluetooth led controller but I’m not sure if it’s a soldering issue or a board issue entirely. And not sure where to go from there. \n\n\nIdeally I want to cut up the 32 feet into 8 different pieces. They’d be paired up and connected with those white connectors. And then the 4 main ones  would be connected to a 4 way splitter. \n\nAny help would be amazing!\n\nHere’s some pictures!\nhttps://postimg.cc/gallery/LjF0bWG",

I would also add some additional retention of some sort to ensure that they never fall into the water.  The control box and the plug in itself would be connected inside of a waterproof outdoor enclosure I am using to connect the pump/filtration system to power.  Finally, the circuit that all of this is on is fed from a GFCI.  On/Off functionality would be controlled via Bluetooth.\n\nI have put essentially the same type of LED lighting on the underside of my truck for courtesy lighting and they have been in service for over a year now with no issues whatsoever.\n\nI think that there is basically no risk with these lights, but you all know far more than I.  In your professional opinion is this a bad idea?\n\nI appreciate your time, so thank you all in advance!",

      "selftext": "I've been working on the house lighting at a strip mall (pole, canopy, wall packs). Most of it has been pretty straight forward but the canopy lighting has always been problematic at this property. They installed cheap 175W MH (non pulse) fixtures that exhibit serious problems with heat dissipation. So I've been busy cleaning up past attempts at fixes i.e. fiberglass insulation and SO cord between the MC and ballasts. It hasn't been much fun since the majority (\\~90%) of fixtures have SO cord and ballast wiring cooked onto the reflectors because they placed it too close to the bulbs.\n\nBecause there have been so many fixtures \\~50+ that weren't working or cycle I've been going after the low hanging fruit (caps, bulbs, cleaning up the cooked wiring). So now I'm down to the last three bigger problems; one string of lights with no power, one with a dropped leg, and one oddball that defies logic. To wit: house power is 208 and one fixture in a string 4th from the end has 120 to ground from each hot but they cancel each other out when measuring between them. Dropped leg right? Then why are the other three fixtures after it working just fine? I can't access the wiring except inside the fixtures in that string because there's no hatch. I'd appreciate any advice, suggestions, or insight the community has.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1spij1tzg9561.jpg?width=4096&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c7023427ef8880c81bdcf7ff0647436371e00349",

          "body": "First off, use some thermal wire when you are close to the heat source (fiberglass jacket over the insulation). That should resolve some of the issues with the burnt wires. The light that's pulling 120 sounds like it did loose a leg, likely in a spice going to the fixture. You will unfortunately need access to fix it, so good luck. That would explain why the lights further down the line are still working like they should. You'll probably find a burnt or broken connection to that particular light. I would recommend that you bring up a viable solution to convert the MH to something that generates less heat and will cause fewer problems in the long run, LED being the popular solution. There are a lot of retrofit options available.",

I would like to continue using the wall switch which is already wired to the light.\n\nA few questions that I would love some help with (I live in the US for reference):\n\n* Can I just get a Light Socket-to-Outlet adapter and plug in a standard LED strip?\n* If I was to wire it directly to where the ceiling light was, would I just connect a 120AC to 12DC LED transformer to the wiring, and the other end to the LED strip?\n* Is there any other solutions available? Or anything I should worry about?\n\nThanks in advance for any help!",

It is the worst kind of deceptive because most people don't understand that they could make an \"EMF Detector\" that triggers on almost anything they are trying to show is harmful.\n \nIt is trivial to make something that scares people by flashing at something, and once they have spent a few hundred dollars on the device they are even less likely to believe it is a scam. A good resource is Electroboom on YouTube, he has a few videos on things like this and it is presented in an easy to understand way.  Another thing that you could do is find things that are obviously innocuous and still trigger the emf reader. Some examples might be an old corded drill, a vacuum, an old tube radio, even the distributor in a car could set it off. Likely anything with a brushed electric motor will set it off and that could prove to him that it is not triggering only on fancy electronics.",

So, a 120W DC power supply delivering 12V would be capable of supplying 10A of current.  (Think of that as how wide the \"pipe\" is, and voltage as the amount of pressure pushing on the water flowing through the pipe.  The higher the pressure, or the wider the pipe, the more total power.)  Now, if you connect a 12V load that draws just a small amount of current, the power supply won't be affected.  It has more than enough available.  It doesn't FORCE surplus current anywhere.  Interior LED lights in a car (the dome light, for instance) are powered by the same huge 12V battery that is capable of delivering 500 Amps.  But, milliamps is all that goes through the LED.",

One thing im attempting to do during this time is place a strip of LED lights on the inside of a linen closet, however I know i cant just hardwire that to a wall switch as one is 120v AC, and the other 12V DC. I know decent amount in regards of electrical work. Ive worked with an electrician last summer, and have done a bit of work installing recessed lights throughout my house and rewired my garage.\n\nBut all of that is \"simple\" black to brass, white to bright, ground to ground. However I have limited to no experience wiring 120v AC to a transformer/reducer to 12V DC.\n\nWill these lights work with this power supply? if not, can you please a recommend one that will (either a light strip that will, or a power supply)\n\nLights:  [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HSF66JO/ref=psdc\\_15704861\\_t1\\_B075LB9HK2?th=1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HSF66JO/ref=psdc_15704861_t1_B075LB9HK2?th=1)\n\nPower Supply:  [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VYHNY2R/ref=ox\\_sc\\_act\\_image\\_1?smid=AYOMIWFVJV81A&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VYHNY2R/ref=ox_sc_act_image_1?smid=AYOMIWFVJV81A&psc=1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: something like this, without the dimmable feature.

I tried HittLights LED tape for a job once and it worked well...kinda but there were some issues with the dimming that kept me from using it again. Have you guys found any LED tape that is dimmable with a standard led dimmer and is less than $300 for a set up?",

I bought more of the exact same model fixture, thinking I could swap in a new \"bulb\" component because that's pretty easy. No such luck: some still flicker, some just don't turn on. Do I need to replace the J-box, and is that something I can/should do myself?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChallenge 2: All 4 of the ceiling fixtures in the master bedroom went out at once. Switched the wall switch on, they flickered and died immediately. I tried replacing the lightswitch. Still nothing. The four fixtures and dimmer switch are the only thing on the circuit. What's the best way to proceed?\n\nYes, I checked the breaker box. If this is relevant: Each room is wired so ceiling fixtures are on separate circuits from wall fixtures. The guest bedroom has both a Lutron dimmer switch and a a Leviton non-dimmer. The master has just a Lutron dimmer.\n\nPlease let me know if I can provide any more helpful details. Y'all are the best.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: added switch information.",

They fixed it for like $150 and it’s been fine in the 2 years since. \n\nSo call some local electricians and see if they can take a look. A lot of them will do a quick inspection for free. If you describe the problem to them like you did in this post, they’ll probably have a diagnosis ahead of time and can quickly check it at your house.",

Non-compatible switches more times than not would lead to wonky dimming or none at all. You can always verify good voltage coming to the switches, then bypass the switch and make direct connections, then power the circuit at the box. That will at least take those switches out of the equation completely.  Obviously you can’t check dimming function, but you get the idea.\n\nI actually turned an old extension cord into a portable power supply by separating and stripping back the wires and adding a basic power switch. When I have issues like this and can’t figure things out I’ll pull it out, disconnect whatever is acting up from the hose power, and connect it to my extension cord that I know is providing good power. Sometimes it helps me verify that I didn’t in fact burn something out and the issue is before it (my attic is hot a hell and full of loose insulation).",

I would say that one strip is like a bunch of bright nightlights strung together. I wouldn't read by it, but I can definitely see where I am going.\n\nBesides trial and error, you might want to look into streamers - lots of them seem to use colored led lighting to set the mood in the room they are streaming in. There again, they are probably adjustable but always seem to be softer as opposed to glaringly bright.\n\nIf I were going to light up a room I would probably start with putting a strip around the outside - like on the ponywall in the basement. If it wasn't bright enough I would add more.\n\nYou can probably compare a standard light bulb vs led strips by the number of lumens each is rated for. If your lightbulb is 3000 lumens and the led is 1000...it'd be 1/3 the brightness, right?",

I will also be putting them in the top of two shower niches. They're 24V.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I cut the end of the LED strips, I plan to solder the copper connections to black and red wires, which will somehow magically connect to a 110V plug that I can plug into the wall. Alternatively (preferably), I can do the same thing and it'll magically connect to an on/off switch in the bathroom wall.\r  \n\r  \nIt's really all of the electrical work from the copper connections to the on/off switch that I'm fuzzy on.\r  \n\r  \nSo a few questions:\r  \n\r  \nDo I want to use the black and red electrical wires? Some LED lights use two wires, some use up to 4. I just ordered mine, but they're RGB colored, so I'd assume they use 3 wires.\r  \n\r  \nPlease explain (Like you would to a 5-year-old) the part where I said I'm fuzzy.\r  \n\r  \nDo I need a transformer or an adapter? If so, where in the wires would I connect it?\r  \n\r  \nDo I need anything special to connect my whole system to an on/off switch?\r  \n\r  \nFriends, I don't know what's going on.

You could also hardwire fairly easily but I didn't want to mess around fishing wires through the wall. Control is all via RF transmitter so no need to wire controls, just place the switch wherever you want it and replace the batteries every few years. I used a really nifty dimmer that has a remote control that fits into a standard slot for a light switch, so you can have it look like it is hard wired and also pop it out to use as a remote. This is the one I used:\n\nhttps://www.1000bulbs.com/product/173383/LED-10053.html\n\nAll told, my system cost about $200 with two zones of control (upper and lower cabinets).

I've got a lot of experience with controllers, strips, power setup, etc, but mostly that's in hobbyist builds (things like back-of-monitor lighting, stuff like that).  \n\nWhat I started doing was getting quarter round PVC moulding and double-sided taping the led strips to the top.  The issue I have is I'm not sure how to exactly mount this to the wall (mostly drywall).  Part of me says long strips of VHB tape would work fine, but I've had mixed results with that (eventually falls off).\n\nI'd be happy to go with a more expensive commercial configuration, but there are ZILLIONS of versions and styles and ung.  \n\nI think my perfect setup would be plastic or aluminum extruded angled mounts, a GOOD way to secure those (wall anchors are always hit or miss), and suggestions on how to run the wiring down the wall (inside and up?).\n\nA setup with a diffuser on top would be best, since that will stop the harsh spottiness that can come from LED strips.\n\nThanks for any suggestions!",

If you are ok splurging there are some slick glass panel one gang controllers you can use with DMX that are powered by 24v. Tunable white only needs three conductors so I'm using 14-3 for all the runs from the DMX decoder to LED strips and 14-2 for all the DMX data and power to wall plate and decoder, this also gives me flexibility to change to a more \"standard\" lighting setup if the 24v DMX stuff totally flops. I haven't decided yet if I'll make my own valence for the ceiling wash (basically a \"T\" made out of wood and the bottom of the T on the wall) or an aluminum track that is meant to be plastered into the wall. I have no clue on the quality of the site but ledbe.com has tons of options for the aluminum track to see the possibilities of what you could buy for the track. \n\nGood luck!

Best get a bottle of wood glue (Elmer's, tite bond 1 or 2 etc. ) And some filler (drydex is a good one) and a little light sanding before painting with a brush. \n\nAnother option is a piece of flat stock or inverted baseboard then place a piece of casing or crown as your second layer built up.

      "selftext": "I have old under the cabinet lights from about 15 years ago that have some sort of electric tape thing and then little light modules that just poke into it, but it never worked well. I don't think all of the lights have ever been on at one time. Regardless, I wanted to switch to some simple led strip lighting, but my cabinets are not all connected, and as far as I understand, all the led strips have to be physically connected to operate, correct? Generally, there is some type of splitter or bridge that would connect to each light strip and then to either the remote or app, right? Aside from opening up the wall, or running a cord out in the open on the wall, is there an option other than getting multiple led strip light kits? Also, if I get multiple is there a way to link them so that I can use one remote, or will I have to have multiple? Lastly, is there an easy way to make led strips function with my current light switch, or is the remote/app/alexa going to be the way to go?\n\nThanks in advance for the answers!",

          "body": "If you search on Amazon for an “LED Driver” that is a little box that basically just connects to AC wiring on one side and the other side connects to the beginning of your LED strip. \n\nSo you can likely wire that LED driver to replace whatever is currently there.  \n\nThe LED tape strips are pretty easy, the one note is that they essentially only run in straight lines so you just need to plan ahead a bit for where you are going to run them and where you have corners. \n\nThey make universal connectors that come in L shapes as well as T’s and crosses, I usually just buy a few of the variety packs and make them as I go. \n\nYou also can use wires that also have the ends already installed to bridge spaces between cabinets where you may not want lights. \n\nSo I’d say this, wiring in the LED driver is super simple assuming the wires are there from your old fixture. Next is to visualize how you are going to run the LED strip in straight lines, where you would need turns or T’s and where you would need a wire bridge between spaces and make sure that you have a way to cross that gap. \n\nIf you can visualize all of that, the actual work itself is pretty easy. \n\nLast tip is that the LED strips are either 12v or 24v, the 24v can run longer distances, but it’s important to match the voltage to the driver you buy. The other is to buy high CRI LED’s. They will be advertised as such and make sure you like the tint/warmth of them. It’s a personal preference but it’s just annoying if you get everything in and they are too yellow or too blue for your taste. \n\nI’ve DIY’d a few of these, so happy to talk through but I’m not an expert by any means, just Simone that has tinkered with this space a decent amount!",

The good part here is that the LED strips aren’t terribly expensive and have adhesive tape on the back that works really well, so they just stick right on. The universal connectors are really easy, one thing that took me an embarrassingly long amount of time to figure out on the LED strips is that there is a positive and negative terminal that you need to pay attention to, if you aren’t paying attention they just won’t light up and you won’t be able to figure out why!  \n\nWhen you do buy the connectors, the plain white lights are just 2 terminals (positive and negative) the multi colored lights sometimes have 4 terminals, so you just want to be sure to buy the right connectors. \n\nYou can buy the lights that come with the LED driver, if you don’t have an outlet you can essentially just cut the wire on the AC end, but otherwise just buying the LED driver separately is easy. \n\nI will say just be able to visualize straight lines, and I do mean straight lines. It’s really easy to get to an edge and think, “oh, I’ll just bend this over here” that doesn’t work. So just plan that out in advance. It’s almost always solvable, but I spent time twisting and turning things that then didn’t stick very well and realized after the fact that a 2” wire would have been all that I needed if I just planned ahead. \n\nIf you wanted to talk through anything as you are shopping, happy to chime in.

I believe the lights you linked to need a 36 watt driver if you intend to power the entire strip with a single driver, but the strips are made to cut so if you only need 1/2 of the strip then you only need 1/2 the wattage as well.

During renovations, I had an outlet placed inside a cabinet (\"Cabinet 1\") so that I could plug in whatever power adaptor I decided on using for the LEDs.  Next to the cabinet, however, is a gap where the sink is before the next cabinet (\"Cabinet 2\").  I regrettably had a 2-conductor wire run through the wall from Cabinet 1 to Cabinet 2--as opposed to a 3+ conductor wire.  Finally ready to take on the project, I realized that the 2-conductor wire limited me to a single-color LED strip.  I would have just run a different wire through the wall, but the current wire does not budge. \n\nI was really hoping to use a tunable white light strip, like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/PAUTIX-Dimmable-2700K-6500K-UL-Listed-Lighting/dp/B08QMSVTY3/ref=sr_1_5?crid=1AR3WIOGDJSW8&keywords=white%2Bstrip%2Blight%2Badjustable&qid=1701468094&s=hi&sprefix=white%2Bstrip%2Blight%2Badjustable%2Ctools%2C133&sr=1-5&th=1) (I don't care much for RGB), but this obviously uses 3 pins.

The easiest and least expensive option would be for you to use the MVP 120v LED pucks from American lighting. These are a great little LED. They are forward phase dimmable so they are compatible with most of the older dimmers in homes. If you are open to something that might require a little more reworking and would be a little more expensive let me know and I can send over a few other suggestions.

The porch was lit up nicely with a consistent white glow and no visible lights and the truck lights were so bright I actually stopped by a police station to ask if they were street legal (barely but yes).\n\nFast forward to today...the strips on my truck are now a pale banana yellow. yellow lights on the sides of a yellow truck not all that bad but the brightness is certainly gone. As for the porch, they seem to still be generally white with a possible tinge of yellow but the brightness is so far gone that they are barely useful as a porch light at all. I am pretty sure the majority of the visibility on my porch right now is coming from the street light out front.\n\nI was under the impression when I installed these that LED lights were magical and should last 20-50 thousand hours or some crazy number. Apparently I was mistaken as after only 7-8k hours mine are all but useless. My question is, when purchasing, is there something in particular to look for? Is there some detail that gives the buyer some sense of quality or longevity beyond the user reviews? I would like to replace the porch strips with something I can trust to last longer than 2 years.",

      "selftext": "Hello all, sorry for such a basic question here, but I wanted to see what everyone does for a more \"professional\" installation of LED strip lights. I have a project where it makes sense to use LED strip lighting (under cabinets, around the top border of a room, etc.), but I have not used these much before.\n\nMy first sticking points are power supplies and wires. I know I can just grab wall warts, and those will probably work just fine, but I am looking for other options. I am not a fan of just grabbing whatever pops up on Amazon, I would prefer to work with better quality, known suppliers. I could be wrong, maybe the Govee, BTF-Lighting stuff is safer and higher quality than I am giving it credit for, correct me if I am wrong. And yes, I understand that much of the cheap stuff that pops up is \"the same, just with a different label\". But I would prefer to work with a product that is UL listed, has good customer service, has a good reputation etc.\n\nAs for wire, I know that I can pick up any wire that has the proper gauge for the current/power that my strips will use, and it will work, but I feel like there should be a good source of 2-4 conductor wire for this application. While it works just fine, it feels weird buying \"Thermostat wire\" for wiring up lights.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.",

There isn't enough depth to the \"tray\" ceiling to locate the power locally (the strip itself is going to sit atop a piece of 5/4 trim) and I was hoping I might be able to locate the driver some 15-20ft away (magenta) and connect at a pair or single location (green) at the start of the strip(s).  The overall length of lighting is about 65feet, so I might be able to feed it to a single location. I am hoping to not have to see a junction box, or at least keep it as discreet as possible.\n\nIf this works, presuming 24v lighting, does 14 or 12ga wire make sense to run to the connection point(s) from the power supply?\n\nI am more than happy to listen to better ways of handling this.

      "selftext": "My apartment doesn’t have an outdoor plug so I run a power strip from my office out a window. On this power strip I have my LED string lights and an inflatable hot tub. Amazingly I haven’t tripped the circuit breaker despite my gaming computer and all the rest of my office on the same circuit. \n\nI know this isn’t the most ideal setup but it’s pretty much my only option unless I run the cable across my whole office and put it out in the hallway. That would be really annoying though and I don’t really think it’s the rest of the office causing the issues. The only time the lights noticeably flickered was when I turned on the bubbles on the hot tub, and besides that they were fine. They only now just started flickering no matter if the bubbles were on or off. It happens pretty frequently, like once every 20-30 seconds.\n\nI’m pretty sure I’m going to have to replace them, but is there anyway I can improve the wiring situation given my limitations so this doesn’t happen again with another set of string lights? \n\nThe lights in question: https://a.co/d/0KOLyKc\n\nI thought that maybe I just got cheap string lights but they have plenty of good reviews and only 3 out of 2700+ reviews mention flickering. I think the variation in voltage with the hot tub damaged the string lights. And when they flicker they all flicker at the same time. I also left them running for quite a long time, sometimes days at a time (need to add a smart plug to my waterproof box but haven’t gotten around to it yet).\n\ntl;dr - been running a hot tub and string lights on the same power strip, hot tub caused lights to dim predictably whenever I turned the bubbles on, this was fine for a few weeks but now they are flickering consistently no matter if I have the bubbles on.

We're trying to find the best solution to move forward. [Picture here](https://imgur.com/a/MoZhK68).\n\nThe lighting guy showed me the strip they usually use, it's about an inch thick but has the power built in, and the light can be angled.\n\nEasiest solution is a strip of wood hiding the led strip, but it would be one inch high and hurts the look of the whole frameless vibe. We could make the strip of wood flush with drawer fronts, which would be kind of an in-set style, flush with the cabinets which would be like a framed style, or put the strip in the back and put the wood in the back covering it.\n\nMy contractor is also willing to modify the cabinet, where he would use a shelf from the cabinet to create a higher bottom surface, and then cut out a section underneath the cabinet to make room for the lighting.\n\nThe only other solution I found is this kind of thing, which is a 1/4\" thick metal channels that fit a frosted bit over the top, and you put the led strip inside. I have no idea how they'd be powered though, and we'd have to hide the power box.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThoughts?",

Something stylish and clean; no obvious wires or strips/channels sticking out.

The electrician that I'm getting to install some outlets, and power for the strips, is happy to do the electrical work, but also isn't a designer. And this job is too small for general contractors in my area to be interested.\n\nWhere do I look to find someone who will **design** a small lighting project like this?",

The converter linked is a 15W converter and I noticed the OEM recommends using it at 80% for longevity, so 12W.  A lot of strips will exceed that depending on how long your cabinets are and you then won't get full brightness.\n\nOn a similar note, some strips are 24V instead of 12V which helps with voltage drop if you have longer runs, so make sure you get the right voltage converter for your strips.\n\nIn any case, a junction box would certainly be cleaner than my converter plugged into an outlet!",

My second thought is to mountain the leds to the wall behind the desk, but the wall is made of cinder block as my pc desk area is in the basement and also with testing it lights they are very bright and it might be too harsh to look at directly. Is there a better way to mount the led lights to the finder block wall? I would also like to mount one of Nanoleaf another products in the same area so I think it would also be very good practice to learn how to install things into cinder block. \n\nAny tips are greatly appreciated",

I'll be connecting multiple of these strips via connectors + the same type of wire you see coming out of the smart module to the first LED strip.\n\nI want to have the light strips starting from the left cabinet, skipping over the stove (via the 2-wires), then light strips again on the right side cabinets.

      "selftext": "I need to decide on undercabinet lighting for an 11 foot run of wall cabinets. This kitchen is above-average in terms of finishes so the cheapest option is not necessarily the best. I've wired a 3-way switch so the lights can be switched from either end of the counter with one side being a dimmer switch. The switches control a standard 15a receptacle in a base cabinet with LVT wire going to the uppers. \n\nAre LED strips a legitimate option? They've always seemed a bit dodgy to me, but maybe I'm being too harsh. I have no interest in hubs/remotes/apps but they're not deal killers. \n\nAnother option might be the Ikea \"Stromlinje\" lights recommended to me by a local electrician. I have to admit they are pretty slick looking but there's two problems: they won't dim with my Lutron wall dimmers and the driver maxes out at 30w and my draw would be 38w. So I would need to run another length of LVT from a second driver which means cutting into drywall; two, the cost is about CAD $500. This set up would be a total of 2420 lumens, or 220 lumens per linear foot.\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks.",

They cost more than strips, of course. For any system,  plan on having a small valance on the lower  edge of the upper cabinets.,\n\nIf you are renovating a larger kitchen I’d look hard at Lutron wireless controls .  To feed under cabinet lights, stub off any convenient duplex for 110v power in each cabinet/ lighting run.  Each run has a slave switch near the LED fixture . All LED fixtures are then easily paired with a PICO remote which controls and dims all slave switches.  No Apps, no wifi , its radio control ,  the PICO switch can be wall  mounted anywhere with zero wiring.  It looks very much like a Decora switch.  Very good system for this application .  It need a new CR 2032 battery every five years or so for the PICO switch .  $5 .",

      "selftext": " Hey r/HomeImprovement,\n\nI'm in the process of setting up an entertainment center and want to add some custom LED lighting using WS2812B LED strips. I'm aiming for a clean and tidy installation, so I'd love to find a device that combines a power supply and a programmable microcontroller (like an Arduino or ESP32) in a single enclosure.\n\nMy requirements are:\n\n1. Power about 10 meters of WS2812B LED strips (I'm fine with using multiple devices if needed).\n2. The microcontroller should be programmable and compatible with standard libraries like WLED or FastLED, as I'd like to create custom lighting effects.\n3. A single enclosure that houses both the power supply and the microcontroller, to minimize clutter and keep things tidy.\n4. Ideally, the device should plug into a standard 115V power outlet.\n\nI've done some research and found a few Wi-Fi-enabled LED strip controllers with integrated power supplies, but most of them don't seem to be programmable in the way I'm looking for. I've also considered building a custom solution by housing a microcontroller and power supply in a custom enclosure, but I'm wondering if there's a more straightforward option available.\n\nHas anyone come across a product that meets these requirements, or do you have any suggestions for a DIY approach that would achieve my goal? I'd appreciate any insights, experiences, or recommendations you may have.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

The problem is they only come in these relatively huge sizes static sizes of 16ft, and sometimes even 50ft.\n\nI've found I'm able to use less on a kit, and attach it to another kit so that I have one that is 5ft, and another that is 30ft... basically running much more or much less that the product shipped with. It seems to work okay. But is this safe? Is it wasteful, or harmful to the lights?\n\nThanks for any insight.",

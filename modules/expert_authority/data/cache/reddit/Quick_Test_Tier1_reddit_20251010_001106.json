So far I was using 12V power supply with a cord, but now I'm looking for a solution to power it directly from wall wires (220V) like normal lights.\n\nThe problem is that I want to make electric stuff fit inside a lamp so when someone wants to install it, they would just need to connect the wires and be done. I'd be using from 50cm to 1m of strip depending on a lamp so 10W power supply is needed. I was looking for so long and the smallest 10W power supply would be 58x25mm [https://imgur.com/SdU0d45](https://imgur.com/SdU0d45)  which is like 2 times too big to fit in. Are there any smaller power supplies or is there any other way to make it work somehow the way I want it? \n\nI know there are 220V led strips that would do the work but unfortunately I couldn't find flexible ones which I need.\n\nIf there is no way to make it work with a 10W strip is there a way to make it happen with 4,8W strip, so 5W. I found a power supply 1-3W which is way smaller and would be great [https://imgur.com/QYP7RDu](https://imgur.com/QYP7RDu) but it's still 3W max which is to low.\n\nOr maybe using led strips isn't the right solution but I haven't found any other because I need a strip of light rather than a bulb.\n\nSorry if I'm messing up some terminology, I'm not a native speaker and I have little knowledge about electric stuff.",

I bought a vinyl gutter, installed metallic foil tape on the inside and installed a LED strip in it. It is bright but not as bright as my original fish tank. My original fish tank came with a hood light that has 4 small LED panels with 3 integrated LED lights in each panel. They are small but they pack quite the punch and even work on my new fish tank but they only fit my old fish tank. I have tried about 3 different LED strips from Amazon but they do not brighten up the tank compared to the original LED hood. Is the the type of LED that I am buying? Because the LED strip hood I made has over 50 LEDs compared to the 12 LEDs on the main tank. Where can I get daylight bright LEDs from? \n\nHere is the original tank hood LED \n\nhttps://www.chewy.com/aqueon-led-15-column-replacement-hood/dp/206060?utm_source=google-product&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=12789772272&utm_content=Aqueon&utm_term=&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIgqbPjZjc9QIVygeICR1OaA0mEAQYBiABEgJHEvD_BwE\n\n\nOne of the few strips I got from Amazon\n https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FQDT1VV/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_i_NHVTAMVJ1QEHSDX7VNDG?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1",

All four sets of LED strips shall be controlled via nearby dimmer switches.\n\nI am currently mostly done with the rough-in electrical (will be reviewed as part of the Framing inspection) but am stuck at how to wire for the four LED use cases.\n\nThere is a plethora of accurate and detailed instructions online and in book form on how to properly rough-in traditional mains voltage, but a dearth of information on how to properly wire for low voltage LED lighting in advance and not as some retrofit into an existing house.\n\nIf you know of existing articles, videos, or even books on this topic, please let me know.\n\nRegardless of that, if you have personal experience at a new construction job site with an LED lighting pre-plan, how did you handle it? Please be as specific and detailed as you are willing to be.\n\n(To clarify, I'm asking here because I want to know the right way to do this. There are _many_ examples online showing how to do this that would never get past my local inspectors and I want to stay on their good side, plus, I would never want to even try).",

The wiring from the transformer to the light strips would likely be 18 gauge or similar.\n\nWhat throws me a little is that if this is all pre-planned, then would a proper installation try to have the 120v->12v (or 24v) transformation done _before_ the switch? I have heard that many dimmers aren't well suited to dimming LED strips and while there are many products out there that can work around the issue (Magnitude transformers keep popping up), the fact that it needs to be worked around suggests that maybe there is a better way if _everything_ is new?\n\nAnd yeah, the ceiling LED lights are going to be installed in an aluminum track with a diffusion cover over it, with the goal of have as even a light source as possible. The shelf lights will either have the same or maybe even a dedicated \"under cabinet light set\" if I can find one that does custom lengths.",

      "selftext": "So with being stuck in the house with this virus going around, Ive decided to add some lighting in the house and do some updates. One thing im attempting to do during this time is place a strip of LED lights on the inside of a linen closet, however I know i cant just hardwire that to a wall switch as one is 120v AC, and the other 12V DC. I know decent amount in regards of electrical work. Ive worked with an electrician last summer, and have done a bit of work installing recessed lights throughout my house and rewired my garage.\n\nBut all of that is \"simple\" black to brass, white to bright, ground to ground. However I have limited to no experience wiring 120v AC to a transformer/reducer to 12V DC.\n\nWill these lights work with this power supply? if not, can you please a recommend one that will (either a light strip that will, or a power supply)\n\nLights:  [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HSF66JO/ref=psdc\\_15704861\\_t1\\_B075LB9HK2?th=1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HSF66JO/ref=psdc_15704861_t1_B075LB9HK2?th=1)\n\nPower Supply:  [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VYHNY2R/ref=ox\\_sc\\_act\\_image\\_1?smid=AYOMIWFVJV81A&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VYHNY2R/ref=ox_sc_act_image_1?smid=AYOMIWFVJV81A&psc=1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: something like this, without the dimmable feature.

      "selftext": "My wife is a teacher and will be teaching from home. Her home office doesn’t have overhead lighting, and we’re blocking the windows for webcam purposes, but now we need to add more light. I’m planning to install crown moulding with led strip lights, but I’m stuck in planning. \n\nWhat I know: i need 52 feet of strip, which is 4ish 16 foot strips. So I need to get a power supply that matches the volts of the led strips and has wattage of 1 strip multiplied by four. Anything I’m missing?\n\nFor general install, I was planning on mounting the power supply on the wall behind a bookshelf so it will be hidden, then running power from there inside the wall up to the leds. What do I need to connect the power supply to the strips near the ceiling?\n\nWhere I’m stuck: I’d like the lights to be dimmable. I’ve seen dimmable power supplies and dimmable leds. Do both need to be dimmable? If I want to dim? And where does the dimming come from? Is it manual at the power supply, do power supplies have remotes? I haven’t been able to find anything. \n\nLast one (for now). I’ve read about connecting power to both end of the led strip to mitigate power loss and help with color accuracy. If I need to do that since it’s a longer run, do I need to get a power supply with 2 leads, or can I run both ends to a single lead?\n\nI appreciate your help and knowledge. Thanks!",

If this is the wrong forum please let me know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am renovating my daughters bedroom, and she wants some LED light strips for decoration. I have installed a 4-5 different LED light strip implementations (under cabinet white, behind TV RGB, under soffit RGB, etc.).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe room is 12' 6\" x 17'.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's what I'd like to install:\n\n\\- Install 5050 RGB light strips around the entire perimeter of the room\n\n\\- Install LED light channel for a cleaner look\n\n\\- Have all LED light strips be the same colour at the same time\n\n\\- Have all the LED light strips power on/off WITH a decora light switch (to the last color that was running on the strip)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are my assumptions:\n\n\\- I will need 4 separate 16' light strips (probably with \"home-run'd\" power, not connected serially)\n\n\\- I will need at least 2 separate power supplies (or maybe 1 uber supply?)\n\n\\- I will need at least 1 controller (1 controller with 4 channels would probably be best?)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow if we were strictly controlling the lights with a phone app or a remote I wouldn't be posting here, but I REALLY want this to work off a decora light switch. Obviously changing the colour or brightness of the strips would have be done with a remote or an app.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of the controllers I've seen (granted I haven't seen a lot of controllers) need to be turned on with a remote or app, which is a bit of a pain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy plan is to wire a duplex power receptacle to a light switch and plug the controller into that receptacle. When the light switch is turned on, the controller gets power and THEN it turns on the LED strips displaying the last used colour/brightness. That way if you can't find the remote or don't have your phone you can at least turn them on (or off)!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan someone recommend -\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Adequate power supply\n\n\\- Make and model of a controller (App controlled would be great!) that can support 4 light strips and when powered up displays the last strip settings\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd if anyone has done an install like this and has any tips or tricks I would greatly appreciate that. If it matters I live in British Columbia Canada.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope this all makes sense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMtM",

      "selftext": "I've got an 120v 66ft LED strip plugged into an outlet controlled by two switches in my small workshop. The sub-panel was installed professionally, then I installed the 12g line, 20a receptacle*, 15a 3-way switches (not lighted), and 15a breaker myself. When the switches are off, I can spot sections of the LEDs glowing very, very faintly. Turning off the breaker kills this faint glow. With the LEDs plugged in, the multi-meter shows 122v when powered, and 7.5v when the wall switch is off. [Edit: With the Receptacle Tester plugged in, it reads 2.5v when switched off.] When I plug the LED strip into another circuit (single switch, 20a), it operates as expected (~120v on, 0v off). \n\nThe 15a circuit shares an outlet with a 20a circuit. The ground wires are all pigtailed to the ground screw. All ground wires read continuity. That's kosher, right? \n(Thats 4 ground wires in the wirenut: 1 to the outlet's ground screw, 1 to a 20a light switch, and 1 to each 15a 3-way switch.)\n\nThe 3-way switches appear to toggle correctly. Being a pretty rudimentary circuit, I doubt there is a compatibility issue between the LEDs and the 3-ways.\n(Originally, I installed lighted 3-way switches, but those were LED-incompatible and left an obvious heavy glow in the LEDs when switched off. Today's glow is very, very faint and splotchy by comparison.)\n\nAll outlets read healthy with a basic Receptacle Tester. (I don't think there is a 7.5v draw when the switch is off if the LEDs are unplugged.)\n\nCan anybody recommend some basic diagnostic steps I can attempt?\n\n\n*Why the mix of 15/20a? Original plan was to have 20a everything in case there was any piggybacking, but ended up keeping the lights on a dedicated breaker to avoid sudden blackouts. Since it's dedicated, and 20a 3-ways have limited selection, I downgraded to 15a for later/replaced components.\n\n[Edit: All switches and receptacles are Hubbell brand]\n\n[Edit] Update: Replacing both switches with Eatons has not resolved the issue, however, it did reduce the measured leak from 7.5v to 5.5v.",

      "selftext": "I'm building a house and I'm wanting to run LED strip lights in a few areas, mainly in my kitchen as my under counter lights. I think they're more affordable and easier to hide. Only problem is the only time I've ever dealt with them was putting them in a liquor cabinet on a side job and there we just plugged into an outlet and ran the strip lights. Although the ower which supplied the lights bought 25ft lengths and we had to use 2 different strips plugged into 2 different locations and it had 2 different remotes for colors etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know there are alot of different options so my biggest question is for you residential folks that may have some experience with these strip lights.\n\nWhat are you installing? I know there are so many different types to run. \n\nAre you putting a switched outlet in the cabinet then just plugging in your stip lights when the cabinet guys are done? Are you hard wiring the strip lights to a transformer and getting the DC strip lights?\n\nI know everyone will have their preferred method of doing it, just wanting to get some ideas before it's time or me to start wiring the house.",

Painting the cable is an easy way to make it disappear, but removing caulk on the baseboards, tucking the wire behind it, and recaulking it, is the best solution I found. Transformer hides inside the box with the outlet, and the cable comes out through a hole in the wall just above the baseboard, where I do the previous to hide it.",

      "selftext": "Hi,\n\nSo I'm renting a house and the owner has told me I can make any minor repairs or improvements I feel like. Our electric bill is quite high so I'm trying to reduce power usage whenever possible.\n\nThe main overhead lights in the kitchen are the older inefficient fluorescent bulbs (the REALLY old kind, with the magnetic ballast, can't remember what they're called) in a recessed cavity with some diffusive panels. I figure I can just stick down some of these cheap adhesive 12V LED strips I have sitting around and then wire them in and disconnect the fluorescent tubes, leaving them in place in case the landlord wants to switch back to them when we move out.\n\nI'm going for efficiency and I don't want to spend more money than I need to. Here are the options I've considered: \n\n* Wiring the incoming switched power to an outlet box and just plugging in an off-the-shelf 12V supply. This would be easy to service and seems like it should be legal (is it?) but seems like the most expensive option.\n* Wire in a 12V switched-mode supply that's designed to be hard-wired. I'm having trouble finding one that fits my current draw needs though, they all seem like they're designed for much higher current.\n* Just use a doorbell transformer and alternate polarity on the LED strips. This worked okay when I did it for the light-up number sign on the outside of the house but the 60Hz strobing is definitely still noticible so I'd prefer not to do it this way.\n* Use a doorbell transformer but rectify and filter the output to feed the LEDs. I'm not sure what requirements would need to be satisfied on the low-voltage side to make this legal, but from what I understand the laws about low voltage wiring are understandably more lax.\n\nWhat should I do? I have an EE degree so I'm not entirely clueless here but I have no problem hiring an electrician to do the line voltage parts of the install.",

Please let me know if I should be posting this elsewhere.\n\nI'm planning to put led strips along the perimeter of my living room ceiling. After some research I realized one strip of leds in series would be way too long... and I was also hoping they would be dimmable.\n\nSo now, here's my new plan.\n\n* An electrician has already installed a [dimmer switch](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Lutron-Skylark-150-Watt-Single-Pole-3-Way-Preset-CFL-LED-Dimmer-White-SCL-153PH-WH/205341522?MERCH=REC-_-PIPHorizontal1_rr-_-100399014-_-205341522-_-N) (Lutron, compatible with LEDs, 150W)  wired to a wall outlet by the ceiling. I had this done before realized I couldn't just plug in one long string, so I'm hoping to not change this part.\n\n* I'm planning to get a magnetic LED driver/transformer like [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/NEW-MODALIGHT-MP82-277v-150W-12V-LED-DRIVER-DIMMABLE-MAGNETIC-TRANSFORMER-277V-/251902864311?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item3aa694abb7). There's no plug so I would need to attach one (does a lamp wire work here?) so it can plug into the outlet. Do I need anything else here, or is there a better choice?\n\n* Then, I would wire the [LED strips](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005GL5UG2?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00) to the power supply in parallel. The strips take 12V, 1.5W/ft, and are 16.4ft long each. They make plug and go type of connectors if you use the cheaper power adapter, but I'm guessing that won't work here. What kind of wire should I use for this?\n\n[Here's a diagram](http://imgur.com/OfalZG8) to help illustrate what's going on.",

Does it matter or is one method better than the other? Not concerned about how much wire I will use up since I've got a ton of it and in the end, everything will be hidden in the ceiling.

I feel like this is going to end up a \"Hire an Electrician\" anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a beam running across a room with a vaulted ceiling which had lights on top of it. The lights have slowly died since I bought the house and I decided to go up and replace it. (Possible trigger warning for scary electric setup).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe lights were essentially LED shop lights sitting inside the top portion of the wooden beam, connected to a power strip (with surge protector) from the 90s that was shoved down inside the beam which was connected to an aluminum outlet box. I tore out all of the shop lights that were there as well as their cords. I also took out the power strip, planning to replace it with a newer/better one. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the meantime though, I wanted to install the new lights that I purchased to see if they were \"good enough\" or if I needed to buy different ones when I went to replace the surge protector.  I plugged the new lights into the outlet that was up there, hit the switch, the light came on, then went off, along with another light that I had on in the kitchen.  I ended up losing an outlet near the kitchen, the kitchen lights, my bathroom light next to the kitchen, and this outlet on top of the beam.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe strange thing is that the bathroom light I \"know\" (i.e. am 80% certain, with my certainty waning because of this incident) is on a different circuit breaker and there are things on the breaker with the kitchen light/beam outlet/kitchen outlet that are working. Regardless, I went down and reset the 2 breakers that these lights were on \"just in case\" and nothing came back on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I said, I feel like hiring an electrician is really my only option here, but I figured I'd see if anyone could provide some additional direction (or even possibilities on what happened). So that I can gather additional information to make it easier on them.",

      "selftext": "So when I bought my house recently, it came with a large floating entertainment system mounted on the wall that had an old (not that old but definitely not new) surge protector plugged in behind it. It works fine for all of my electronics, but if I want to plug in one or two more things, like my old PS4, I simply don’t have enough space to do so due to large power bricks and awkwardly shaped plugs. It is very difficult to access the actual wall outlet, requiring me to completely unmount my TV which took quite some time to do. What would be the best course of action? Is it ok to plug a power strip into the surge protector? I know it isn’t the best solution but any other solution I can think of would be a huge hassle. My other option would be guesstimating where the outlet is and attempting to cut a hole out of the entertainment system with a jigsaw or multitool. Things I have plugged in right now: \n\n-77 inch LG CX OLED TV \n-Sonos Arc Soundbar\n-Nintendo Switch\n-Abode Iota Security Hub\n(I have no room left on the strip with these 4 things but there are 2 more slots available that I can’t access)\n\nThings I might want to plug in:\n-PS4/5\n-small LED lights installed on the entertainment center (this one I can do without) \n-Possibly some more sonos speakers in the future\n\nAlso sorry if this isn’t the right subreddit to be asking this 😢",

I bought these LED strips for my bathroom and an electrician is installing them so a switch outside the bathroom will control them, they won't be connected to a socket w a plug, instead through the wall to the mains? i think that's the term. \n\nThe pic shows the LED strip info. I was going to buy the IKEA driver (TRÅDFRI Driver for wireless control) but my ikea doesnt have it in stock and ikea said I'd need to get 2 because the max wattage is 10 and each light is 5.6W (i'm buying two led strips). Is there an alternative I could buy from like screwfix, toolstation, b&q or amazon? I don't have much space to hide 2 of these and saw they can be quite discrete too. \n\nI tried searching for LED drivers w max wattage of 12 to cover these 2 lights. I read online the voltage does not matter? If you could tell me what limits to search for that would be amazing bcs I can't find any that are DC as well as 12W max and at least 24V? I'm not sure what I should search for. I don't think it's worth ordering 2 of these ikea ones along w shipping for almost £30 when i could get just one to connect both of my LED lights.\n\nIdk if i explained this correctly. Can anyone pls tell me what i can search for that would suit this picture? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uj24naoc52x71.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2261dc32cdca22df7eaa5eccfae66888ee5def53",

If you go way below a limit you can run into reduced efficiency in the power conversion and because the unit is designed to give 30w if you have a fault in the light that causes a partial short potentially you could have a slight increase in fire risk.\n\nIn this case I wouldn't expect either of those to be an issue. If you're really concerned about the potential for a fire from a partial short that draws less than 30w you can put a fuse or fuses in line with the unit output.\n\nOne note, that unit is designed to work with their smart home stuff. I think it will work fine being switched off and on manually but you may want to test it a bit before install. Upside, you can use their smart home switches instead of a light switch if you'd prefer...\n\nThat being said check with your electrician.

      "selftext": "Hi all!\nI have a quick question that I’m hoping someone could answer. \n\nI was reading up on the codes and it says that an outlet shall not be controlled by a dimmer (because apparently some motors can blow with inconsistent voltages?). But there seems to be an exception for “lighting loads.” Would LED strips fall under that category of lighting loads? \n\nI recently bought a dimmable LED light strip (working voltage: 12V DC). One end of the strip has exposed wires for a hard wired connection while the other end connects to a dimmer which connects to a transformer that plugs into an outlet (you can forgo the dimmer connection if you don’t want to dim). My understanding is that if i plug the lights into an outlet, i need to use the included transformer and if i want to hardwire them then i need a new transformer (which seems to cost around $150-$200) that changes the voltage to 12V for the lights. I’d like to dim the lights from my kitchen switch (it used to control a light that was in there but i disconnected and removed the light to look at the wires, they’re standard B/W/copper). \n\nFor my question: \nIf i install a dimmer in the kitchen then can i install an outlet that’s connected to my kitchen dimmer and plug the lights into that outlet so that they’re dimmed from the switch? I want to do this for 1) a cleaner look and 2) the ability to dim without having to walk over to the outlet each time to use the included dimmer. \n\nAll help would be appreciated!!",

      "selftext": "Hello electron connoisseurs! \n\nI turn to you as a humble computer nerd seeking some theoretical help. I have a eMotorWerks JuiceBox Pro 40 - it is a 240v, 40 Amp Electric Vehicle charger that is powered via a NEMA 14-50 receptacle. I am on my third unit (twice replaced by warranty) and it too seems to suffer from a GFI trip phenomena with zero load. Warning - scroll below. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The TL;DR version is that I replaced everything in my circuit (save for the 6/3 conductor cable) and with all new stuff plus a new charger - I still have phantom GFI trips.** \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAllow me to paint the picture of my house infrastructure:\n\n* House built in 2002 - relatively new. \n* Main panel consists of two breakers -> 30 amp to the A/C compressor and 100 amp to the sub-panel. \n* The sub panel is a Siemens populated with SquareD breakers.\n* See picture of panel [here](https://imgur.com/nAu9D2L) before I wired anything. The breaker is now in the bottom right corner in that perfect spot you see :)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHow I wired my NEMA 14-50 receptacle (mains were turned off at the time - both the 30 and 100): \n\n* The receptacle is about 4 feet away from the sub-panel. \n* I added a SquareD double pole 50 amp breaker - [see here](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Square-D-Homeline-50-Amp-2-Pole-Circuit-Breaker-HOM250CP/202353323)\n* Added a Leviton NEMA 14-50 [receptacle](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Leviton-50-Amp-Flush-Mount-Shallow-Single-Outlet-Black-R10-00279-S00/300324414) in a metal mounting box.\n* Romex 6/3 cable and a metal conduit. \n* Red and black wires to the breaker, neutral (white) to the neutral busbar and ground to the ground busbar. \n* On the receptacle end - pretty self explanatory - 0.5\" strip size with X/Y being the hots, green for ground and the remaining one for neutral.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat kind of crap I have in my house?\n\n* Nothing! Aside from my A/C, I do not have any other high load appliances. My dryer is gas and my stove is gas. My lighting is all LEDs and the only thing that draws more than 150 consistent watts is my server rack which has low-power equipment running off a conditioned UPS. It is literally chugging along at 150-170 watts, total. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter installing all of this and ensuring everything is tight and secure, I plugged in my charger and everything was working flawlessly. Roughly a month later, the charger went into a single beep error mode. Research online indicated it was a \"general fault\" and I should just power cycle it. I did - everything was cool. About a month later - same thing. This time, I contacted the manufacturer who indicated the unit suffered from \"GFI auto test circuit failure\" - whatever that meant. It still worked after power cycling. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe manufacturer requested I send it in while they send me a replacement. I got the replacement unit, installed it and everything seemed OK. However a few hours after installation, it went into a three beep error mode which indicated GFI trip. From that point on, it would do it multiple times (requiring a power cycle) at random intervals - sometimes within a few hours and sometimes days apart. With the exception of a single instance, all the GFI trips occurred while the charger was idling and not plugged into my car. The one time it was plugged and charging - due to a demand-response feature the charger has, it was running at 6 amps.\n \n&nbsp;\n\nAt this point, I suspected something was up with my wiring. I powered off the mains again, cracked open the sub-panel and discovered that one of the hots into the breaker was loose. It was held in by cable flex/tension - but I could pull it out of the terminal with ease. There was, however, no evidence of arcing - no carbon, no melting, no charring. I retightened everything, went through everything again and once I was satisfied all endpoints were tight, powered everything on. The charger seemed to function but a couple days later, it trip'd 4 times (several hours between trips). \n\nThis time around, I got a new charger (under warranty), replaced the breaker, replaced the receptacle, checked everything multiple times and energized. The new charger worked swimmingly, event charging my car and idling with no load without any problems for a whole 5 days! On day 5, which is today, it tripped in the morning with zero load and again this evening with the car plugged in BUT not charging (as it was not time to charge). \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe manufacturer has no clue wtf is going on. They say their logs simply record a GFI trip event; no recording (at least as far as they are telling me) of any measurements or anything of that sort. Apparently it was escalated to their developer team so they are going to dig into this further. It is worth saying that I suspect the unit has a soft-GFI circuit - meaning software and not mechanical (if that makes sense). During the trip, the unit is actually still online and can be accessed via its web portal - just not charging until a power cycle commences. I should also mention that no other pice of equipment or GFI receptacle in my house trips (either coincidentally with the charger or by itself). \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo while the manufacturer is digging on their end - what could, possibly, causing this if not a software bug?\n\nSorry for the scroll... hopefully my write-up made sense to y'all!\n\nThanks!!",

I used the CFL casings as my JBoxes with driver and connections easily accessible inside the old CFL box. It was a quick workaround \n\nNow this is at home so I have time to redo this with 2 Dimmable drivers instead of 4 non-dimmable drivers and swap in a Caseta dimmer to add into my home automation setup. \n\nI have my backslash open (ripped out) and 4 circuit branches that fed 4 separate drivers hanging out of the wall under the cabinets. I’d like to terminate 2 of them and wire up the other two to my new dimmable drivers.\n\nI’m thinking of using two  of the old 24” CFL housings to house my driver and make my connections. \n\nFirst question: any better housing/box I can use to house my drivers and connections? My alternate scenario is pull one branch to the top of the cabinets, install the driver there and send down two 12V lines. This would add about 5-6’ of run to the 12V line\n\nSecond question: anyone know of any surface mount low profile box I can terminate my decommissioned branch lines in?\n\nThanks for your input !",

      "selftext": "Good Morning/Afternoon. \n\nI am in the process of a basement remodel and would like to get some input about some new wiring I want to do for lighting. As it is, I am trying to get an electrician to come out and take a look at my box, since it's full and I want to add a few more and split some of the circuits that I currently have. But that is not what this post is about. I do have some background in electrical wiring from my undergrad days, but most of my experience is tied to low-voltage and swapping out switches and outlets. \n\nOriginally, this room had a single hallway light, and three fluorescent light fixtures (each on a different switch around the room WTF?) with ballistics for two t8 bulbs a piece, plus two outlets all coming off the same circuit. \n\nI've already ripped out the fluorescent lights fixtures and just currently have a single socket fed by a single switch while we do the remodel. I am wanting to install 8 light canisters to put LED bulbs in one room, plus two more in the hallway. I will also like to install one outlet that is in the closet that is tied to a switch for an LED light strip. If I can't break the outlets off on to their own circuit, there will be anywhere from four to six outlets on this circuit as well. \n\nI have [drew up a diagram of the proposed wiring](https://imgur.com/7j9BtRd).

After digging out the other end, it’s got the other half of the disc with heat shrinking around it labeled “E209436”.\n\nI don’t know much about household electrical installation, but I’ve installed a fair number of ceiling lamps and they’ve basically just been fancy-looking ways to connect L and N  to the bulb. I’ve never seen any such small components built into the lamp itself.\n\nWhat is it? Do I need it? Can I just strip the wire and use it without that bit? AFAIK it’s just a straight connection to the E27 bulb that’s in there (I live in Europe). \n\nI’ll only be using LED bulbs in there in case it’s some kind of resistor or something.\n\nHere’s a picture: https://share.icloud.com/photos/06V1-ZzoBFXqMkiUp-9Z9SX9A",

Is it going to be open or closed? Working around the public, or in the back of the warehouse? \n\n3. Do any boxes need any modifications to hang the new fixtures? If any rework is involved this could be easily $100-300 or more per fixture depending on what they need to do \n\n4. Can one man hang a light or will it take two or three? This can easily double your labor costs. \n\n5. Usually when a customer buys materials to save money, they probably would have saved more by asking us to pick the best lights. Why? Because well pick lights that are easy to work with and fit the application. Maybe you bought lights that every single one needs to be altered to fit where it's going. \n\n\nI can keep going but these are several big ticket items that you can't even get into the ballpark of before you figure it out. \n\nPut it this way though, each laborer should be $180-$1,000 per day. Plus materials and overhead. $180 being on the low end where guys don't speak English and don't wear safety shoes and have tools from Walmart. $1,000 is probably for an outfit that owns their own lifts, super clean and professional, they probably offer a wicked warranty, they probably have some smart and good electricians working there. \n\nMaybe the workers aren't making that much but that's what boss man should be charging for each guy. \n\nSo if you have 3 guys who take 2 days to do it, you could easily be looking at $1,500 - $10,000 in labor and equipment rentals.",

      "selftext": "I'm looking for a recommendation for under cabinet kitchen lights.\n\nI am currently re-modeling my kitchen. We are doing a full tear out down to the studs, re-doing all of the electrical and have custom cabinets that will be installed. The cabinets are built with a 1/2-3/4\" lip on the bottom side to install under-cabinet lights and hide the fixture.\n\nWhat I would like to have from the lights:\n\n* Smart controllable via HomeKit (Apples EcoSystem)\n* Physical control outside of phone app (switch or button)\n* Dimmable LED\n* Color temperature control (like to have but not requirement)\n\nSo far, the two options I'm looking at are:\n\n1. Hardwired with a Lutron Caseta switch and LED light strip. Pros of this is that it has a hard-wired switch and will match the rest of the switches in the house. The downside is that I'm not sure I'll be able to control the color temperature of the LED lights and I'm unsure of which LED light strip would be the best for this application. Also, I think I need a \"dimmable power supply\" and am not familiar with these solutions but can do my research it this would be a better route to go.\n2. Other option would be a LED \"light strip\" that plugs into a standard outlet. I could hide the outlet inside a cabinet and drill a small hole through the bottom side of the cabinets to keep the wire hidden. I could then add a HomeKit based button somewhere under the cabinets to turn them on and off. This option works it seems like I SHOULD do a hard-wired solution since it's a new kitchen. Product I'm looking at for this is the Phillips Hue Light strip: \\[https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-and-color-ambiance-gradient-lightstrip-80-inch/046677570552#faq\\](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-and-color-ambiance-gradient-lightstrip-80-inch/046677570552#faq)\n\nAny recommendations would be highly appreciated!",

      "selftext": "After doing a lot of research... yeah, I know, this is chasing gremlins. Located in Pittsburgh, PA, USA.\n\nFor background, I am a DIYer who is slowly trying to make my 100-ish year old house safer. A new panel was put in about 17 years ago by professionals hired by the previous owner with a lot of updated wiring and the work there seems to be good (romex, major appliances on home runs, no obvious silly stuff), but there are still several circuits in the box using old cloth-covered wire in armored cable. In an effort to make things safer without ripping open walls, I decided to install tamper-proof outlets (<2 year old running around the house) and AFCI breakers for at least the bedrooms running off the old wiring. One circuit in particular is giving me fits.\n\nSo here's, as best as I can determine, how this circuit runs. The bedroom involved is directly above the kitchen:\nBreaker panel -> light switch for ceiling fan/light in kitchen -> light switch for ceiling fan/light in bedroom -> bedroom outlet -> bedroom outlet -> kitchen outlet (not near sink/wet area) -> dimmer switch for PROBLEM light fixture -> light switch for outside back porch light -> breaker panel. The PROBLEM light fixture stopped working a couple months ago so we just haven't been using it, slipped my mind to address it until now.\n\nAfter I installed the AFCI breaker, flipping the switch for the back porch light would trip the breaker. It's a Murray breaker that had LED indicators and it is indicating \"Arc Fault to Ground\". \n\nI thought maybe the PROBLEM fixture was the culprit so I took it down today and sure enough the wires were loose in the wire nuts and the old cloth-covered wiring was in shoddy shape. I fixed it up as best I could, stripped new connections, new electrical tape around new wire nuts, made sure there was no strain on the wires, etc. However, the PROBLEM light fixture still does not work. I have not yet replaced the dimmer switch that controls it.\n\nNow the following things trip the breaker and indicate Arc Fault to Ground: flipping the back porch light fixture switch on, turning on the ceiling fan in the kitchen (the light is fine, just the fan trips it), turning on the TV on one of the bedroom outlets. The ceiling fan in the bedroom doesn't trip it. The lights in the kitchen ceiling fan are LED so lower load. The light in the back porch fixture is incandescent.\n\nSo, it seems like a moderate load causes a ground fault, but with at least three different things on the line tripping it (the TV and ceiling fan did NOT trip it before I re-wired the PROBLEM light fixture), it is very hard to isolate.\n\nAny suggestions as to where I could start? I do not own a multimeter but am more than happy to pick one up if it will help narrow down problems. Using an outlet tester, all 3 outlets on the circuit are wired properly. However, being old wiring, there is no ground wire on the outlets. I am assuming this is a neutral problem somewhere but I'm having a hard time tracking it down.",

In the case of arc fault breakers (and dimming systems/lighting in general), each circuit can have roughly 10 convenience outlets (local codes will adjust this number, but 10 is a good average). Aside from the dedicated kitchen and appliance circuits, the average home doesn't need more than 5 or 6 breakers for convenience outlets. Those convenience outlets would normally be wired with 12/2. Before the introduction of arc faults, it was common to see 12/3 pulled for convenience outlets, with one leg taking care of two bedrooms and the other feeding the master bed room as an example. ",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nSo to start, I don't know much about electricity, and I apologize if my questions are a little too elementary. I bought a house last year and basically bought it as-is, and assumed that a bunch of the lights that were out were just dead bulbs. Fast forward a year later, and I ask a handyman to change out the bulbs, and he says there's a problem with the electric. Here's what they look like:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gk652qmdjc451.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4da14769acdff5e35dc03bd82dde399d5e399834\n\nI called my home warranty company to try and do something, and they needed to cut a hole open next to the light, because for some reason they couldn't pull out the light. Well it turns out, each of these are 12V lights with a transformer attached. The transformers are actually larger than the hole that the light comes out of. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ai5hkneijc451.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de721d703c62f8a86e32a0a9fc5b08e252f65aa6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oq9ewfeijc451.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f1e60b0cd92a8d9c30348fb0fd3aa73af30619ea\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yq8oaneijc451.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b1237d04afc6744846ad5c42d87383ec11008ca\n\nThe home warranty company won't cover it, because since there is a transformer, it's not an electrical issue, but a transformer issue. The best guess for at least 70% of the lights being out is because the transformers are all dead (they were installed probably between 2004-2006). I could have each of the transformers replaced, but the electrician let me know that they would probably die again in about ten years. Oops, I forgot to mention, I own a two unit house, and there are 12 more of the lights upstairs, half of which are out. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uv08rn2okc451.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2a34b188eaee256de804ccd3b2ba35a2168b0076\n\nSo my questions for this subreddit:\n\n1. Would you replace the transformers, or just have new recessed lighting that uses 120V (and this is n00b me... doesn't most indoor lighting just use 120V?)? Is one more cost effective than the other?\n2. What would be the best way to handle all of these (if possible) with minimal damage to the ceilings? I know that I'm going to have to pay to get things re-drywalled/painted, but do I really need 18 holes?\n3. For the last photo, I thought it would potentially be cool to get rid of all those lights, since I have chandeliers there anyway, and maybe do an LED strip hidden in the recessed portion. Do you have any thoughts on that?\n4. Open to any other options that would be \"trendy\" or cost effective. I bought a two-unit to airbnb one, but also haven't started airbnb because of Covid-19. My home looks mostly historic with modern touches, so it's sort of anything goes!\n\nThank you all so much for any help, and if there is anything that I need to do to the post to make it fit (didn't see any rules) it'd be much appreciated!",

      "selftext": "Hi there. I am building a bar and came up with this plan to install these led bulb lights in my bar. It's an outdoor/indoor led light string that I put the sockets through holes I drilled in the plywood, screwed the bulb through the wood into the flush socket, ran the cord in the gaps of the bar build, and plugged into an outlet that I wired to be switchable. Looks amazing, quite proud of the plan.\n\n[Pic 1](https://imgur.com/kPTct65)\n\n[Pic 2](https://imgur.com/yFhfBM6)\n\n[Pic 3](https://imgur.com/idrIn3p)\n\nOf course, at the time I wasn't thinking in an \"electrical code\" way. Now, that I have had an electrician come in to QC all my basement work, I've realized that there is no way I could get this set-up past inspection. And if it can't pass inspection, I don't want it.\n\nSo my question is: can anyone provide any code-allowed advice/ideas for how to get that old-timey bulb look? I can't really think of any way to do it, considering I wouldn't want wires sitting on the front of the bar in any way, i.e., just like stapling this light string to the face of the plywood, and running the cord on the outside of the bar to a receptacle, so that it's always removable and such.\n\nAnother note, I was planning on building a led platform/box that booze bottles sit on. I guess I could run led strip lights on the top of the bottom half. Considering that, would led bulb lights be kind of overkill or unecessary? I just really liked the look and was excited about them.",

In my years in commercial electrical doing lutron, eaton, cooper/green gate, ketra and other systems I've never seen an LED straight up operate directly on 120v AC voltage. Even the shitty strip lights HD sells come with a plug in driver for the lights.\n\nBecause that's the problem when applying AC to LEDs and diodes. Your lights are going to flicker and not work properly even if you managed to find a line AC to low AC transformer. LED strips are not the same as your typical christmas light stringer (I know how series wiring works). Yes you can run LEDs on AC, but that requires proper calculations and alterations that would make zero sense to OP.\n\nHence why I am asking if there is a driver involved. It seems as if OP wouldnt know that off hand and if he is worried about a lack of room for a receptacle how would he fit the driver for the lights in the same space?\n\nYou're trying to flex your epeen when it isnt called for.",

The LED vanity bar is literally a piece of LED tape behind a lense, the surface mount fixture is a piece of LED tape stuck on in a spiral.\n\nIt's very simple to make LEDs work off of AC, you can find MR16 LED replacement bulbs that work straight off of the 120>12v AC transformer in a low voltage pot can. And basically every single LED Christmas light string on the planet is just LEDs in series, with no driver. How do those work on AC instead of DC without problems?\n\nThis is nothing about \"flexing my epeen\".

I believe it is not to code to route wiring through more than 2 studs that are together. I am going to try and figure out a plan B. \n\nEdit: So my plan B might be one of two ways. I should point out this entire area is hidden completely behind a fridge that slides into this slot in the cabinets. The first possible method is to use an exterior conduit or raceway to pop the cable directly out at the switch box and go into a hole on the left hand side of the 2x6 stud. Option 2 would be to check the outlet for the fridge and see if two different feeds are connected and if so to disconnect one of them and use it for the LED driver and new switch instead.

      "selftext": "Hey Everyone!\n\nI'm converting my detached two car garage in to a studio so I can work from home, in Oklahoma. The garage has power now, but just a single outlet and a few lights.\n\n[Here is an Imgur album with photos and descriptions of the the electrical boxes on the side of the main house, and one box on the deck that I believe powers the hot tub](https://imgur.com/a/mDUkG)\n\nThere is no panel at the garage.\n\nI was hoping it was going to be as easy as running out some new lines to the garage. Doesn't look like that. He informed that we only have a 100 amp panel at the house, and there simply isn't enough power to run out to the garage and power everything.\n\nI've done some internet reading about the difference between 100 amp and 200 amp panels, but I know so little about this, I'm kind of lost. Hoping someone can give me an ELI5.\n\nMy power consumption in the new studio will be fairly low.\n\n* Computer and a few monitors\n* Powered speakers, not very large though\n* Rack gear for effects\n* Lighting, mainly LED\n* Mitsubishi heat pump running on 220v (There's an in image in the photo album with the power specs)\n\nFor reference, all of that gear (minus the mini split) is running off a single power strip in my current studio (to avoid ground loop noise). Never had an issue with it in 2 years.\n\nThe power consumption at the house, I have no idea about. There are two medium sized A/C units, standard appliances. Heater, oven/stove and dryer are all gas.\n\nThe bid was as follows:\n\n* Upgrade service and panel to 200 amp - $1800\n* Wire studio room (280sqft) - $1500\n* Install 2 A/C disconnects at main house (code) - $400\n* Run underground lines to studio 70ft - $700\n* City permit and inspection - $450\n* ------------\n* Total $4850\n\n(Included in the wiring of the studio he will hang/install all the lighting fixtures.)\n\n\nEDIT: I received this reply from a non-electrian over on a studio building forum. Is there any merit to this?\n\n\"If you already have power in there im confused. Why cant he just swap the breaker for the lights, proabably a 20, with a higher breaker, say a 75 or 100, and where the feed enters the garage, put a breaker box with seperate feeds for all the receptacles and lights. Just use the original light spot as the supply. If the home panel has a under amped main breaker on the panel, swap it out. If not, then your meter is the 200amp fuse unless theres a disconnect somewhere else in the chain. Definitely get more bids. Contractors love ignorant home owners.\"\n\n",

You can't just swap the breaker out for a larger one unless the wire is sized for it properly, which it very likely isn't.  Putting a larger breaker in  could very easily result in a fire. Don't listen to any of their advice unless you're interested in having a house fire. As for the work you need done, I'd probably recommend a service upgrade to 200 amps as well. While you have several gas appliances, a hot tub+ 2 AC units and a mini split plus the other loads around your home is really starting to push the limits on a 100 amp service.  I can't comment on if the price is good as prices vary from area to area but I would advise you to get at least 2 more quotes from other electricians as well to know if it's fair or not.\n\n",

          "body": "When calculating adding on circuits you must calculate the total wattage of the appliances and devices in your house, anything over 1500 watts must be counted. There is of course exceptions and rules to how to calculate this all, but with a 100 amp service you don't realistically have a crazy amount of room. Hot tubs add a massive load to your house, so much that when we get calls to look at adding bigger furnaces and such, if we find hot tubs it is almost always a tell tale sign of being close. \n\nOften times people may add circuits despite your load calculations being over what it should be, which is most likely why you still need to upgrade regardless of adding new devices. You were probably already over the allowed amount and thus you will require meeting basic code rules before the licensed contractor would do the work.\n\nAs for the price, many things might need to be factored in (local laws and such can make this change greatly from province to province) such as feeding conductor size, meter base size, panel size, etc.. Typically in our installations we have had to contact the power supply authority and request larger service feeder wires leading to the meter base, the 100amp meter base would get swapped out for a 200, along with changing the pvc or conduit sizes to account for this change. Where I live the supply authority will cover costs everything on the supply side of your meter base(it belongs to them) but after that it's up to you to pay. \n\nSorry for the long ramble and I apologize if none of this is applicable to you and where you live, but I hope I might have helped you understand what might have been considered in the quote to have it be high. \n\nPs. 4500 for a service upgrade isn't really that bad in my opinion, I've been on smaller jobs of the same nature that cost more ",

Unfortunately he doesn't have a distributor for Mitsubishi, and I need a particular model because of it's noise rating. When he realized he couldn't get it for me, he suggested I buy it online and he'd install for a flat fee, $750. The unit is $1750, free shipping. I called Mitsubishi and they will honor their warranty as long it's installed by a licensed tech. The best HVAC bid I had for the same unit was $4500. \n\nEssentially he's saving me $2000 bucks on the HVAC. I don't think he'd honor the deal if I had someone else do the electric and asked him to install the mini split. So someone would have to underbid him by $2000, which I kinda don't see happening.\n\nAlso, I need an ERV for fresh air in my space, and he's going to install that included in the bid. I feel like overall the bid was fine, just wasn't sure I needed the whole panel upgrade and what that meant exactly. But you've set my mind at ease. Thanks!",

A simple 40 amp resi ac disconnect is like 15 bucks so labor is all that you're paying for there. But, he has a family to feed and if he'll save you 2k elsewhere, I wouldn't beat him up too much.

      "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI am trying my best to replace an old shower light fixture with an LED fixture that goes flush with the ceiling. However, I am not an experienced electrician and have come into an issue where I don't see any ground wire. Included are three photos:\n\nPicture 1 [https://imgur.com/a/LicnsNx](https://imgur.com/a/LicnsNx)\n\nPicture 2 [https://imgur.com/a/T8vcbly](https://imgur.com/a/T8vcbly)\n\nPicture 3 [https://imgur.com/a/oEkcxGA](https://imgur.com/a/oEkcxGA)\n\nSo, I have those two wires. My first question. Should I assume the black is hot and the whiter one is neutral?\n\nIf so, I was told by an electrician that some old houses don't have ground wiring in their fixtures. So, instead, there's a metal box that you connect the light fixture's ground wire to. Is the metal box he's referring to the one in picture one that's up inside the wall and to the left? If so, do I just unscrew that screw that's visible, twist the new light fixture's ground wire into there, and then attach the other two wires as normal?\n\nIf so, that's not too bad, I just don't have access to the wire tips because I don't know how to remove that bulb thingy, so I wanted to use a wire cutter and cut them off before that other metal case and the bulb thing and then strip the wires down a half inch to tie into the new light fixture wires. Should that work?\n\nEdit: I am taking the advice /u/joedimwit and hiring out...despite the fact that he's a self-proclaimed dimwit. However, if anyone has a moment, I am still trying to learn as much as I can about electrical work. If you could explain to me whether or not my thought processes were correct, or if I am totally wrong, it would be helpful. \n\nI also took out the huge cylindrical canister because I assumed it was only meant to be there for the other fixture. Would I have had to install that along with the new fixture, or was that canister a part of the old fixture?",

To drive the strips, it requires a stronger driver, one that needs to be wired up. His parents won't approve of an unlicensed electrician running cables in a wall due to a fire hazard (despite me having installed 1,000,000 GPOs in my own house) and wants the cable to be visible, similar to an extension cable. Is it legal for flex cable to be within arms reach as long as:\n\n\\- no building wire or copper is shown  \n\\- it is connected into a wall outlet, then into a driver with a cover protecting the terminals which requires a screwdriver to open up  \n\\- from the driver, flex cable comes out and runs up the wall to the exit light  \n\n\nI'm still learning about electrical standards and rules, hence why I'm asking. Please let me know if this complies with ASNZS3000. Thanks",

The top outlet at the same receptacle is controlled by a light switch in the room and is thus only suitable for a LED lamp.  \n\nToday I had builtins bookshelves with a desk area installed over this outlet.   I realized, however, that I need to put some of these devices (like the printer) in different locations now such that they can't effectively share the same surger protector, although they need to be on the same outlet.   I'm wondering if it's possible to daisy chain two small power strips together, one on one side of the outlet, the other on the other side, while ensuring that no additional items can ever be plugged into them.  I've read all the warnings about  daisy chains and overloading a circuit with too many devices, but given I have all these devices on a single strip now, I want to understand if having the same load but in two power strips was really any different.  Thanks for answering what is probably a dumb question!",

      "selftext": "First, information dump. I'm living in a dorm room like apartment in Beijing, China. I'm trying to set up a small kitchen. This ideally would involve an [induction plate](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?spm=a230r.1.14.3.n6O4Gg&id=533972828584&ns=1&abbucket=4)@2100W or two, a range hood@160W, a [pressure cooker](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?spm=a230r.1.14.21.Eo1ndE&id=526062780845&ns=1&abbucket=4)@1000W, a [pizza oven](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?spm=a230r.1.14.48.Rygftr&id=44295152912&ns=1&abbucket=4)@1600W, and an immersion blender@400W. Also lights, but that's 10W LED strips. \n\nThere's 3 breakers (CHNT DZ47-60 C20, [link](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/chint-DZ47-60-2P-C20_1923740616.html)) , and I think the outlets are rated at 10A. There's 2 outlets the ACs are plugged into (split room), which seem to be rated for 16A. There's two 10Aish outlets near the cooking area. I'm not comfortable wiring things, due to an unfortunate accident with a Wimshurst Generator in my childhood. I do possess the manual dexterity to plug things into power strips though.  I could get power strips rated for [16A](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?spm=a230r.1.14.13.wKZrRo&id=14042297025&cm_id=140105335569ed55e27b&abbucket=4).  I can't change the wall wiring/run more circuits. I'm not sure anything is up to code, or whether there is a code. There might be, but I don't think whoever installs things here read it. \n\nThe question is, will running a 2100 W induction cooker from a wall outlet kill me in a tragic fire? Will running everything at once from one outlet kill me in a tragic fire? How would I lay things out to enjoy delicious  ragu  bolognese and not perish/trip breakers? Do I need to hijack one of the AC outlets? I feel like I need an expert opinion, preferably one which can tell me whether this plan is terribly misguided, or  still within sensible bounds. I'd ask a Chinese electrician, but I don't actually trust Chinese electricians. ",

All 3 on separate breakers.\n\nWas going to replace the ballast, but upon removing the cover and then the light itself, the wiring coming into the light from the ceiling was strange, at least to me … 2 wire bundles coming in, one white from each connected to the white lead on the ballast and a RED connected to the black lead on the ballast … ground was capped off up in the box.  \n\nThis light is on a 3 way switch.\n\nI decided rather than replacing the ballast, I would convert the light to a power outlet that I would have on the switches and it would give me more flexibility as to what to put up on the ceiling for light, link some new T8 LED strip lights to spread the light out a bit, etc.  \n\nGiven the pictures included here, is this possible? would i just connect the whites and red to the outlet and in what configuration?  could i uncap one of those grounds and connect it to the receptacle?  Why wasn't a ground attached anywhere with the light installation?  And what position are all these items in place in the grand scheme of this 3 way switch setup?  i'm sure I've forgotten a question I had, but I've already asked too many!\n\npicture explanations\n\n\\- Round box is ceiling light wiring \\- 2 whites hanging down capped off temporarily, they were connected to white lead to ballast and red wire capped off temporarily, was connected to black lead on ballast, other wires capped off up in box are 2 blacks from the 2 mains coming in and the grounds are also capped off up there\n\n\\- Red wall is switch in the kitchen \\- this one's a mess … switches on either side are to other lights, switch in the middle goes to garage.  two reds connected to the right side there, the black connected appears white, but all due to contractor painting during house build.  ground on the bottom there, also appears white, but just from the paint\n\n\\- other pic is switch in the garage \\- top black wire is actually a white wire that appears to be sharpie'd black (which I've seen diagrams of placing black tape to identify a wire running to another box)",

Something like [this](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61XcHWXUheL._SY355_.jpg) or [this](http://i.imgur.com/dKyZBwx.jpg) (I've used both).\n\nDoes Lutron, Leviton, or another quality mfr. make a 12v dimmer switch? Doesn't have to be wireless, though that would be nice.\n\nI found [this one](https://www.superbrightleds.com/moreinfo/single-color-dimmer-switches/slvdx-60w-led-switch-and-dimmer-for-standard-wall-switch-box/1181/#/tab/Reviews) but reviews suggest it's pretty cheap-feeling, and may not hold up. It does illustrate what I'm looking for, though.",

      "selftext": "Hello /r/electricians,\n\nI am in the process of doing a home remodel, and could use some advice from individuals who know what they are doing. \n\nRecently, I hired an electrician to install the wiring for an new kitchen install, and he setup the under cabinet lights as an hardwired instead of adding a gangbox inside the cabinet that would allow any string of lights to plug in and be routed underneath. \n\n[This is now what I am working with](http://imgur.com/a/zt7rl).\n\nThe problem is, there is no physical wall switch for this hardwire line. Not an issue originally as I was planning to have the same switch that triggered the kitchen lights trigger the under cabinet lights using Z-Wave. If there was a light switch for the had wired line I would just toss in one of [these](https://www.amazon.com/GE-Wireless-Lighting-Control-12722/dp/B0035YRCR2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1493489051&sr=8-1&keywords=zwave+light+switch) and be done, but alas, nope.\n\nNow that I am stuck with hard wire, I am looking for a solution that would allow for... well, any solution that would allow a zwave strand to be hard wired. Or, allow a normal strand to wired with zwave using a device like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Aeotec-Z-Wave-Micro-Dimmer-2nd/dp/B00IRI1CEK/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1493488784&sr=8-2&keywords=zwave+aeotec) or [this](https://www.amazon.com/Fibaro-Micro-Controller-Z-wave-Strips/dp/B00P1N68FW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1493489627&sr=8-1&keywords=zwave+led+light+strip).\n\nPossible to maybe splice the cord from a retail unit like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Aeotec-Aeon-Labs-Brightening-Atmosphere/dp/B01MRROSHG/ref=sr_1_31?ie=UTF8&qid=1493488804&sr=8-31&keywords=zwave+aeotec) to the hardwired line visa a junction box?\n\n[Use something like this in the line somehow?](https://www.amazon.com/Aeotec-Z-Wave-Micro-Dimmer-2nd/dp/B00IRI1CEK/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1493488784&sr=8-2&keywords=zwave+aeotec)\n\nI am open to ideas. Originally I was expecting to have a normal wall outlet, maybe hidden in the cabinets, and plug something [like this](https://www.amazon.com/Aeotec-Aeon-Labs-Brightening-Atmosphere/dp/B01MRROSHG/ref=sr_1_31?ie=UTF8&qid=1493488804&sr=8-31&keywords=zwave+aeotec) into it.

      "selftext": "So I want to use some LED strip lighting in my bathroom, around my mirror/cabinet. I'd like to tie them into the light switch circuit. I can access that circuit in the attic, and I could easily install an outlet above the cabinet to plug the power adapter into. But I've read in a few places that all bathroom outlets should be GFCI. And I've also read that any GFCI outlets should not share the circuit with non-GFCI outlets/switches. I can't tie into the GFCI outlet already there, as that line comes up from the floor (from the 1st floor bathroom, actually) and it's going to be impossible to snake a wire from the attic down to that outlet.\n\nWhat are my options?\n\n(In US)",

(Look for the chart around the end of the page)\n\n\nThe chart says it's Working Power is 60 Watts per 5 Meters of LED stripe. I'd like to cut it to 2 x 35-40cm long pieces. Please keep this in mind if you decide to do help me out! Thanks!\n\n\nI have a 12V 70Ah car battery and the connection currently houses a regular 12V lightbulb, but I couldn't find the operating Amperes or the Wattage on the bulb. (The LEDS would replace the lamp) It has no switch, but I'd like to install one. The bulb lights up when the door is opened and I want to keep that feature to I'm planning to add a switch right before the LED stripes.\n\n\nI could not find an Ampere value of the battery, only the 70Ah. If I understood it correctly it only states that it can supply 70A for 1 hour, 35A for 2 hours and so on...\n\n\nShould the LEDs be in parallel or series?\n\n\nWhat kind of resistors do I use and where do I put them?\n\n\nIf I failed to describe the situation properly I could try to draw, but I would probably fail miserably... \n\n\nAll ideas are very appreciated and welcome!\n\n\nBig thanks in advance!\n\n\n(I'm from the EU, so sorry for the metric values!)",

      "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI have somewhat recently moved into a three bedroom house in the Los Angeles area, built in 1966. Every single outlet is of the three prong variety. I plugged in a power strip that has an LED that illuminates when ground is present, which it did. In the other port of the wall outlet, an AC was plugged in. The AC is the window variety, but it is permanently mounted. I unplugged the AC in order to plug in a vacuum tube amplifier. When I played music through the amp, I got a lot of 60Hz related noise. It was then I noticed the ground LED on the power strip was out. I unplugged the amp and haven't used it since as I don't think playing using that type of equipment without proper grounding is safe. \n\nNow that summer has rolled around, I plugged the AC back in and noticed the power strip saying it had a ground back. Confirmed it was the AC causing the outlet to be grounded. So, I got one of those little outlet testers and went around the house checking the outlets. \n\nThere are three window AC's that are permanently installed and all three exhibit the same behavior. No outlet plugged in, open ground on both plugs in the outlet. AC plugged in, the other plug is correctly grounded. \n\nAll of the other outlets I tested have open ground EXCEPT the outlets that the stove, fridge and washer/dryer are plugged in to as well as all the outlets in a small side addition to the house that houses the washer and dryer. This small addition happens to be right next to the kitchen where the stove and fridge outlets are grounded (but none of the other outlets in the kitchen are grounded). \n\nSo, besides an unsafe wiring scheme for the house, what is going on with the AC's and grounding? I went outside and didn't notice any ground wires coming off of their enclosures or anything. It's also worth noting that no other outlets are affected by the AC's being plugged in, only that specific outlet. \n\nThank you for any insight as to why this is happening. ",

What /u/ProudNortherner said sounds like a good estimate. Sorry for the wall of text but here's a good method of pulling those tiles and replacing them after. Ignore the fact it's about comm cable, it's the same principle.\n\nProblem\n\nInstalling communications cabling above lock-tile ceilings can lead to \nthe problem of gaining access to the area above the ceiling and then \nreplacing the ceiling tile.  In some cases, the ceiling has been \npainted, making it difficult to remove the original access panels. \nAlso, the position of the spline rail can limit access to the wall \nbacking the termination field or the end-user device.\n \nSolution\n\nTo remove the tiles neatly and replace them securely, first determine \nthat there is a cable pathway above the ceiling and that the tiles are \nnot glued in place.  Gain access by carefully removing the ceiling \ntiles, using these common handtools: utility knife, slotted screwdriver,\ndiagonal cutters, and three jumbo, non-skid paper clips.\n\nProcedure\n \nRemoving the tile\n\n  1) Locate the tiles you intend to remove using these criteria: \n  convenient pulling points, location of termination fields, and \n  positions of end-user devices.  Score the edges of the tiles on \n  all four sides with a utility knife.\n\n  2) Determine the side that locks into the rail and leave it in \n  place.\n\n  3) Insert a long, slotted screwdriver into the score lines along \n  the three other sides.\n\n  4) Carefully break the seal of the access tile and pry it down, \n  using the screwdriver as a lever every two to four inches on all \n  three unlocked sides.  The tile should now drop out.\n\nReplacing the tile\n\n  5) Straighten and cut in half three jumbo, non-skid paper clips.\n\n  6) Insert the access tile with the intact slot fitting into the \n  spline rail, pushing it up into place.\n\n  7) Insert the pieces of paper clip at a 5-degree to 10-degree angle \n  from the ceiling's horizontal plane and into the three adjoining \n  tiles at two- to four-inch intervals.  The paper clips will hold \n  better if inserted at an angle.  This is accomplished by taking one \n  end of the paper clip with needle-nosed pliers and pushing it \n  through the edge of the cut access tile and into the surrounding \n  tiles at the specified increment.  The paper clip will now function \n  as a peg, supporting the static load of the tile.\n \nMark these specially prepared access panels for future entry by \nsurrounding the access tile with colored thumbtacks or another form of \nidentification.  Be careful not to damage the tiles and rails \nsurrounding the access tile.  Also, make sure to inform the building \nowner of this procedure and the locations of all access tiles.\n\nWhen establishing the penetration points for the paper clips, be sure \nthat the side of the access tile that locks into the spline rail \nremains in place.  When inserting the paper clips, hold them with \nneedle-nosed pliers while pushing them through the edges of the access \ntile and into the adjoining tiles.  Inserted at a 5-degree to 10-degree\nangle, the paper clips serve as pegs, which secure and support the \naccess tile in place.\n\n",

      "selftext": "I'm setting up a small work room in my rental house. Because the wiring is old 2-prong, I installed a GFCI outlet to provide some measure of safety and allow me to plug three-prong devices in.\n\nOwing to the restricted amperage I have in the single outlet in this room, I chose a Lights of America LED shop light for the main light source. I have this attached to a power strip I can turn on and off with a hard switch to make it easier to turn off, and also for general bench use.\n\nOn the same outlet is a drill press with a basic single phase induction motor of the start capacitor type, with no run capacitor. The capacitor is basically dead, as I have to hand start it. (It came with the drill, I haven't gotten around to replacing it yet). It is controlled with a stand-mounted \"light switch\" style switch.\n\nHere's the issue: I notice that even when the light is switched off internally with the pull chain and externally at the power strip, the LEDs will continue to glow very faintly.  So long as it is physically plugged in at all, it'll be on, dim but operating.\n\nIn fact, the light never fully shuts off except in two cases:\n\n1. The induction motor is physically disconnected from the circuit by pulling its plug\n\n2. The drill press motor is running at full speed.\n\nThe GFCI outlet is supposed to not reset properly if there's a wiring fault before it, but it resets fine, and there's only the single pair that feeds it in the box, no additional pairs for other outlets. So the whole problem seems limited to what's in the room.\n\nThe power strip is just a Walmart special, so I'd bet it's just disconnecting the hot leg with the switch, not both.\n\nI know it's wasting power to leave it like this but mostly I'm concerned about it being a safety hazard.  \n\nWhere could the power be leaking through? And is this a sign of a dangerous situation with the induction motor?  How can I test and verify no other current paths exist?\n\nI can provide pics when I get home if there's something you'd need to see.\n\nThanks!",

          "body": "There's a possibility that there isn't really a problem. The motor is a highly inductive load, it'd be pushing/pulling current into the neutral slightly out-of-phase with mains voltage. \n\n\nSince the neutral wire has *some* resistance, the fact that current is flowing through it means that at any point between the motor (or anything else) and where the neutral is connected to earth/ground there will be some voltage. (Voltage equals current times resistance.) \n\nThe LED light would be fairly capacitive, so combined with the motor running you might get a *tiny* amount of current flowing back and forth into the light's capacitors from the neutral even with the live/active wire disconnected. Not enough to run the light or be a danger to anyone, but just enough to produce a faint glow. \n\n\nIt's things like this that are the reason why electricians often use test lamps instead of digital multimeters, because they're not fooled by this kind of thing. \n\n**Edit:** Just realised that you mentioned that this happens when the motors *aren't* running. It might be worthwhile checking the voltage between neutral and ground at the power strip. I don't know about the GFCIs you have over there, but over here they often don't trip unless there's at least around 30mA of current leaking. If your light is drawing less than that, the GFCI would still reset just fine even if there is a small leak to ground.",

Typically I’d use a standard led driver with a 24v led strip but I’m concerned about 1) voltage drop and 2) overloading the dimmer.  Lutron makes a 250W LED dimmer but I believe you need to de-rate if in a multi gang box.  Haven’t had to run this many watts of LED strip lighting on a single switch before.  \n\nAny recommendations for either 120v tape lights or a setup I can run off a 0-10V dimmer?  \n\nThanks in advance!",

The starters can go back to the same driver though. Their blaze series shows a max run of 55 feet on the 24v system. I didn’t look at the rest of their stuff. I sold them for years and like the product. They also have some cool dimmers with the driver built in so no need to hide a driver but I don’t think those are enough for your application. You should check them out though. Nice stuff and the website has layout assistance.",

The uppers, unders and toe kicks against the kitchen wall dim perfectly, but the toe kick on the kitchen island does not dim, only turning on and off like a standard toggle. I find this strange because the toe kicks on the wall cabinets and thr island oprate off of the same slider dimmer (14/2 switchleg from the dimmer up to an outlet in the attic, and another 14/2 from the attic outlet down the kitchen wall, under the slab and up into the island where it terminates to another plug). The wires in the attic are tied through and pigtailed to the outlet. I tried reolacing the transformer, and using a new LED strip, no dice. Am I missing something here? ",

      "selftext": "As the industry shifts towards low voltage lighting, often in the format of LED fixtures or LED ribbons, wired back to a LED driver (custom installations, kitchens, closets, accent lights, etc) ... **Are you installing any overcurrent protection on the output circuit of the LED driver, if there's not something built in?**\n\nIn some of the smaller installations that I've done, like a typical kitchen, specifying an LED ribbon for under cabinet lighting, maybe one cabinet with accent lights for display purposes, I normally just wire it back to the LED driver and call it done. \n\nA project that I'm wrapping up at the moment is a larger installation of a custom walk-in closet that's extensively lighted in the cabinetry, total of 54 lights (which range in wattage between 2.3 and 4.5), broken into six home runs, tied back to a 2-channel 200 W driver. On this one, I'm putting two ATO fuse holders with 5 amp fuses. That way if a fault occurs, hopefully it will blow one fuse, and not wipe out the driver, half of the system would still work, and troubleshooting can then be broken down into home runs to figure out which cluster has a problem.\n\nSo this got me thinking, find out what everybody else is doing, either in general or on a larger more complex installation.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1la0vxy)",

It states it uses 43W for 125W equivalent.

I am inside that range on this fixture. I worked with a journeyman from the place I worked at the time I replaced my fixtures. I quit electrical after several months, but I know what a correctly tightened wire nut feels like, so I am certain my connections are tight; no loose neutrals or anything. Also had my buddy check over anything I worked on. We had a falling out when I quit so he would be unable(unwilling) offer suggestions.\n\nSo I am at a loss on why this is happening.\n\nI have seen that the driver sometimes go bad, but this was a big light in a tight hallway so I do hope the only theory is not that the light needs replaced lol.",

I attached the ground to the green nut in the wall mount, and attached the white wire in the wall to the white wire on the fixture. I ended up capping the black wire in the wall and attached the red wire in the wall to the black wire in the fixture... when I attached black to black instead of red to black, the light just stayed on and the switch no longer worked.\n\nNow I get this low buzzing sound from the fixture that I can't figure out how to remedy! I poked around online and a few forums recommended upgrading the dimmer switch to one that is LED compatible. I purchased and installed this switch, but the buzzing continues and is almost louder than before: http://www.leviton.com/en/products/dsl06-1lz\n\nHow to I stop the buzzing? Would switching to incandescent bulbs help? Is it a problem with the load going to the fixture itself, or did I possibly install the fixture incorrectly? \n\nAny ideas?",

There are two downsides to this: one is they're hard to find and sometimes expensive. The other is they require a neutral. You mentioned having an extra conductor, so hopefully this will not be a problem for you. \n\nI use a Leviton 6615 dimmer with Philips Warm Glow bulbs. It dims down very low, doesn't flicker, and is completely silent. \n\nWhen I don't have a neutral, I use a Leviton 6674 (leading edge phase cut) which is easier to find and relatively cheap.  It's not silent but relatively quiet as far as dimmers go.  I also use this with Philips Warm Glow bulbs.

      "selftext": "First of all, I appreciate any and all help/advice. Electricians here have been incredibly helpful to me a couple times in the past, and I am always blown away by the responses. So, thanks.\n\nAnyways, one potential complication is that I'm doing this to help a friend, in Japan, so the outlets are all two-prong, and components might look a little different, but the basics will hopefully be the same. Hopefully my diagram here lays out what I'm trying to do:\n\nhttps://img.frl/hz2fx\n\nIf not, basically I have access to two existing cables, one going to a switch from a duct fan, and another to an outlet. Ideally, I would like to use a t-tap to pull power from one of these wires and run some LED lights through a dimmer switch, which, again ideally, I would mount to the wall right next to the existing switch. \n\nI'm pretty sure having the switch there would require me to run another cable following the existing switch cable through the wall, but I wanted to get some advice before I start anything. I made sure to get LED string lights, and an [LED compatible dimmer switch](https://img.frl/yuzqp), but the string lights are made to just plug in, and since I can't dim an outlet, I think I would have to cut the female end and connect the wires to the wire coming from the dimmer directly.\n\nDoes any of this sound feasible? Is there a simpler way to go about this? Do I need to provide more info? Again, any help is appreciated. Cheers!",

My customer has 4 of the Progress Lighting P-8022 LED surface mounted fixtures installed. They wanted a dimmer, and we normally stock the Cooper brand toggle style dimmers because they supposedly can dim LED, CFL and incandescent... and as a bonus they come with white, ivory and light almond parts, you only have to stock one dimmer to cover most scenarios.\n\nThe LED fixtures are flickering when the dimmer is off. The grounding is good. They are 3 way switching circuits. I dialed in the threshold on the dimmer. The flickering continues indefinitely when the switch is off. This started when the dimmer was added. Any ideas of a cheap device that will dissipate this bleed-over voltage that might fit inside the switch box or in the attic? \n\nAlso, yes, I checked the manufacturer's compatibility list and there are a few rather expensive Lutron and Leviton dimmers listed (all Decora style) that I would like to order only as a last resort. \n\nEdit: added some details",

The one in my bedroom is wired for a 3-way bulb, but since the bulbs it requires are being phased out in the US, I'd like to update the lamp to accept LED bulbs while still maintaining the dimmable (preferred) or 3-way feature.\n\nI thought this would be easy: find a kit and install it when I had a half hour to spare.  But I can't seem to find a kit that accepts anything other than incandescent bulbs.  I'm not afraid of doing something more complicated than a kit, but I don't know where to start, and I can't seem to find the info I need from Google.\n\nTL;DR: My wish list: a touch dimmer that accepts LED bulbs that I can install into my copper bedside table lamp or instructions how to make one.  I am in the U.S.",

Here's what I know:\n\n* Three separate rooms flickering. Each one has a dimmer switch. All dimmers have been replaced.\n\n* Multiple houses in the neighborhood have reported this issue - I've only been to the one house so I can only speak to their experiences but they have not had flickering in any room without a dimmer. \n\n* The different rooms do *not* flicker all at the same time. Nevertheless, the power company has been out to the neighborhood to inspect their equipment and they claim the problem isn't on their end.\n\n* Half of the lights in each room have been replaced to see if it was a bad batch of lights. No dice, the lights are fine. (Enclosed LED disc lights in every room.)\n\n* All connections in switches and lights have been inspected to ensure no nicked wires, everything is twisted tightly, no loose neutrals, etc. \n\nI'm about out of ideas on what it could be. Normally I'd swear on my life that it was bad dimmer switches but it's multiple houses in the neighborhood, and all the dimmers were replaced, one even got replaced twice. Tomorrow I'll be installing shunt capacitors on the lights but if that doesn't help I will be out of things to try. \n\n\nPlease tell me someone has some intuition I haven't thought of yet on what might be happening. Could there be a frequency issue on the incoming power that only causes issues after hitting a dimmer? Maybe a nearby warehouse on the same substation? Something even wilder?\n\n\n(Before you ask, it's a production neighborhood and we've installed the same switches, same lights in hundreds of other houses - they are compatible with each other.)",

Literally nothing you buy will make this work, because the result is that you are dimming the dimmer that is already on the cord.\n\nThe lamp plugs into a wall socket, with is a hot and neutral wire at 120v or 240v depending on where you live. 0-10v dimming requires 4 wires from the dimmer to the light, the hot/neutral, as well as a +/- dimming pair. Nothing exists to install a dimmer to 0-10v dim a plug, because you need 4 wires from the dimmer to the driver.\n\nSo I don't even understand where you are getting the idea that you need a 0-10v dimmer, because you don't. The dimmer on your lamp is between the driver and the lamp, so it is dimming the DC portion out of the driver, that is not 0-10v dimming.\n\nAt worst, install a caseta smart plug that just does on/off, and doesn't dim. Turn the lamp on/off with your phone, but dim it with the pedal.",

Ran with 12/2 wire on a 20amp breaker.\nI bought two different suggested supposedly compatible LED dimmer switch. One is a Leviton 6674 sureslide 150watt LED and CFL/600 watt incandescent, 120 volts. The other that was actually one of the suggested “factory tested” dimmer switches from Globe Electric, Lutron LG-600PH 600watt 120 volt. \nNeither switch has a range adjuster on them.\n\nThe first switch would flicker randomly. Mostly when it was at it’s brightest setting. So i switched it out with one of their suggestions and the flickering seems to be worse. It flickers randomly at any setting and a lot at the lowest setting.\nSome people online said changing the bulbs fixed it for them. While others said changing out the switch fixed the issue.\n\nSo after checking all my connections and changing out the switch. I was wondering what to do next? I can’t just keep buying switches and bulbs and hoping that they match up.\nDo i just need a better switch with a range adjuster to fix this issue or am i in over my head?\n\nSorry if my post isn’t in proper format. Though a contractor of 10yrs, my electrical knowledge is limited. So please explain it to me like i’m five.",

      "selftext": "I apologize if I shouldn't post in here as I'm not a professional electrician. But I'm upgrading the light switches in my new home and need some guidance. \nLive in the US.\n\nI have several lighting areas with multi pole switches with dimming.  The kitchen uses 2, downstairs hall uses 3,  the upstairs hall has 5... don't know why that many but that's the way it's set up. \n\nLast owners used Legrand HCL 453pmmw for the master controller and then the others in the circuit are the matching slave, sorry did not get their model number.  All of the switches are able to dim, but only the master switch has the led level display.  The system all works fine. But I wanted to add zwave or wifi connectivity and function,  and I can't find that in a matching legrand product. \nSo I went with Leviton dz6hd multi pole zwave dimmer. \nI've followed the install instructions exactly in regards to how to wire it for all connections; line, load, travelers, neutral, ground. And the secondary switch was already wired correctly to work with the original setup up.  But it just doesn't want to work.  I've switched the traveler's just in case and still nothing.  Are different brands not compatible for this? \nI would slightly understand if the dimming didn't function, but not even turn on off?\n\nIn other projects I've mixed brands on a more basic level where a leviton zwave multi pole without dimmer worked with some other generic Decora switch. \n\nThanks in advance.",

I am interested by the fact that the light performs much better at a different residence. \n\nI’ve ordered a new bulb to see if that works, but I want to be sure I’m not slowly frying it by plugging it into the same thing. \n\nThanks!",

My electrician is willing and able to 'convert' these fixtures for compatibility with dimmable bulbs, but I'm having a bit of a hard time finding commercially-available options. What are my best options for: 1) dimmable bulbs (of size 48\" and T12), and 2) switches compatible with these bulbs? (links would be awesome)\n\nEdit - multiple comments are informing that I should just switch the fixture, which seems like a good option and I will run it by my electrician. In any case, the purpose of this post is to try and find commercial options that I can purchase for the bulbs and compatible dimmer switches.",

One operates the 2 light on the left and the other operates the 3 lights on the right side of the room.\n\nI had a Lutron on both sides, the right side one that operates 3 lights died within months of use.\n\nI never bothered to replace it. Now I got smart dimmers on amazon, installed them everywhere in the house. But then again that same side of the basement killed the dimmer. No breaker was tripped.\n\nThe bulbs used are halogen 50w each. The dimmer can take up to 400 watts.\n\nWhat could it be? The house was built in 2008, I'm guessing the fixtures are not the issue.\n\nBTW, the bulbs used with the dimmers were always the same. I bought a box of 40 when I finished the basement. Could it be that the bulb is killing them?",

So with that, the windings can be tapped anywhere from 0-130vac. Less voltage means a dimmer light. Since the waveform is still a sine wave, the lightbulb doesn’t ring.

      "selftext": "Edit: this has been solved and thanks to u/wytheguy. CL Maestros do in fact work with a mechanical switch on the other end of the 3\\-way, and it doesn't even have to be a 3\\-way switch. Nor does it matter, apparently, whether you have power to the dimmer first or not. Common on the mechanical switch side gets spliced with the traveler that's *not* on the dimmer's blue 'communication wire' screw. So only two screws needed, hence being able to use a single\\-pole single\\-throw switch, which is neat. Once you have this wired you need to program the dimmer to accept the mechanical switch with a sequence of button presses \\(press and hold the tap button and up on the rocker until the middle LED blinks, then press and hold the down button on the rocker until the bottom LED blinks, then press the tap button once to save the setting\\).\n\nFor the first time I've run into a 3\\-way switching issue that I thought I'd share to get feedback or at least warn people before they waste as much time as I did on this, or find out why I'm an idiot.\n\nSo these fancy dimmers that have an indicator light when they're off \\(specifically Lutron Maestro\\) say on the packaging and in the literature that they're compatible with either a standard 3\\-way switch or a companion dimmer of the same type. Obviously they work like anything else, one side gets the line and one side gets the load with a 3\\-wire between them. I've installed them before, and on this particular job I installed the master/companion as a 3\\-way no problem, single pole no problem....sort of, more on that later.\n\nBut when I installed one with a regular analog 3\\-way switch on the other end it just doesn't work once you turn off the lights from the non\\-dimmer side, no power at all. So I tried everything, just to see if I was losing my mind. I tried jumping the load wire to the standard 3\\-way switch thinking maybe the digital circuitry in the dimmer only works if it's not the line side. That could make sense, it needs some current to keep the indicator light on in the off position. No difference. I tried another identical Lutron Maestro dimmer in case the first one I  used was defective, no difference. The chance of getting two defective ones in a row must be astronomical, right? I tried it with a slide dimmer with an analog switch knowing it shouldn't work and it didn't. I tried it with the standard 3\\-way switch and a regular slide/switch combo dimmer and it worked normally, so there's definitely no issue with the wiring. I tried it with a non\\-companion dimmer of the same type and it didn't work, as expected.\n\nIs it possible that contrary to the manufacturer's instructions these just don't work with a standard 3\\-way switch, even with the dimmer always receiving power in every position?\n\nAnd getting back to the single\\-pole installation of the same dimmer, I tried to use them with LED puck\\-lights for under\\-cab lights. Of course making sure that both the dimmer and the lights advertise themselves as dimmable and compatible, I'm aware that CFLs and LEDs with digital circuitry usually won't dim as low. And the result was that the dimmer could not turn the puck\\-lights off. When the dimmer should have turned them off, they're still on at the lowest setting. No issue with the exact same dimmers as single\\-pole switches wired exactly the same for pots with LED bulbs. Maybe a minimum power draw issue?\n\nAnyway, I'm done rambling. Either I'm missing something obvious or this style of dimmer is to be avoided. Too many un\\-billable hours wasted.",

      "selftext": "Hello, I have decided to change the old incandescent light bulbs in my dining room with newer (dimmable certified) LED bulbs. When I changed them, I have noticed that the LED bulbs stay on at about 5% intensity when the dimmer is off. \n\nMy first thought was that maybe the dimmer wasn't LED compatible. I have tried to change the dimmer to a LED-certified one, but the problem remains.\n\nWhile replacing the dimmer, I have noticed that the wiring to it seemed odd, so my guess is that the problem comes from there. \n\nI would like if someone was able to explain to me what each wire does and how everything is connected together, so I can try and fix the problem. I'm new to this and don't know a lot. My house is in Canada and built 1900.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/aAKBBqA   http://imgur.com/Jcq7t6Z\n\nOn the left is the dimmer. In the middle, it's a power plug which I've never dared to use. They seem to somehow share some wires from the same cable which seem to be black, red, and yellow. On the right, it's another switch which I won't be changing that controls another light. It's connected to its own wires on its right, which you can't see on the pictures. \n\nIn the LED fixture, there is only two wires which don't have color codings (old fabric insulation). There is an electrical box somewhere in between the dimmer and the fixture, but it's not easily accessible as it's covered by spray-on insulation. Thanks for the help.\n",

Since we have three wire, I am gona guess its 1 hot, 1 IC, and one switchleg. The curent wiring looks like they wanted to have the plug on the switch as well (which for your uses is unneeded.) If I were a guessing man without tools, I would guess the black is the hot, white is IC and red is switch leg. Try testing that by removing it all and just connect the black and red to the switch. IF this works, then split the black between the plug and the switch and use the white for the neutral. They may of split the plug on the neutral side for some reason (removing the metal part that connects the screws) and if this is the case you either new plug or to jumper the screws.\n\nEDIT: Also the hidden box is a violation by canadian code, I cant say for certain for the US but I think its safe to assume so.",

      "selftext": "My house was rehabbed in ~2000 and is full of 6” can lights - maybe 50 of them. I want to replace them all with LED trim kits, but I’m struggling with the color temperature. I tested a few and here is what I thought.\n\n2700K was too yellow.\n\n3000K seemed okay, but did have a slight yellowish tint on all the white trim around the house.\n\n3500K I actually did some work in the basement and had 10 of these installed (Electrician’s choice, not mine). They look great during the day and seem to match the daylight really well for me, but almost felt too industrial and bright at night. It felt like a football stadium. The dimmer controlling the basement also controlled a bunch of other cans and wasn’t LED compatible so I couldn’t tell what dimming them would have done.\n\nI get that this is a “personal choice” type question, but what are people installing in new residential construction these days? 3000K, 3500K, 4000K, ...? Are people using different temperatures in different rooms?\n\nThanks, in advance, for your time!",

      "selftext": "I recently installed a new ceiliing fan that has a built-in LED.  It's a Patriot Lighting brand from Menard's and specifies on the box that the light is dimmable with a compatible LED dimmer.  The unit came with a remote contol and receiver that allows you control the fan speed and the light color/dimness, and the whole unit is wired to a single pole switch.\n\nLast week, I purchased 2 dimmer switches, one for the light and one for the fan (links below):\n\nDimmer for LED: [https://www.menards.com/main/electrical/light-switches-dimmers-outlets/dimmer-controls/legrand-radiant-reg-450w-led-cfl-single-pole-three-way-dimmer/rhcl453ptcccv6/p-1452209500502-c-6321.htm](https://www.menards.com/main/electrical/light-switches-dimmers-outlets/dimmer-controls/legrand-radiant-reg-450w-led-cfl-single-pole-three-way-dimmer/rhcl453ptcccv6/p-1452209500502-c-6321.htm) \n\nSpeed control for fan:   [https://www.menards.com/main/electrical/light-switches-dimmers-outlets/dimmer-controls/legrand-radiant-reg-1-6-amp-de-hummer-single-pole-three-way-fan-speed-control/rhdh163ptcccv6/p-1458095303882-c-6321.htm](https://www.menards.com/main/electrical/light-switches-dimmers-outlets/dimmer-controls/legrand-radiant-reg-1-6-amp-de-hummer-single-pole-three-way-fan-speed-control/rhdh163ptcccv6/p-1458095303882-c-6321.htm) \n\nThe room is already wired with a single pole for a fan and two 3-poles on either side of the room for a light.  So my plan is to replace the single pole with the fan control, and replace one of the 3-poles with the LED dimmer.  \n\nThe fan unit has a memory, so with the remote control wired up, I set the fan to the fastest setting and the light to the brightest setting.  Then I rewired everything to the set up with the switches.\n\nThe result was that the fan with single pole speed controller works perfectly.  The LED dimmer on the other hand does not.  The best way I can descibe it's function is that it is touchy.  When I switch the power to the LED off and then on (from either swtich), the LED does not turn on.  But if I move the slider for the dimmer a bit, the LED comes on, and the dimmer function works (mostly) as it should.  I say mostly because there is a bit of flickering, but maybe it just needs to be calibrated.  Since this function is unacceptable, I took the LED dimmer out and put back in the original 3-pole switch (no dimmer function) and everything functions perfectly.  This is the current configuration for the past few days, and I've had no issues with it.\n\nSeemingly the issue is with the compatibility between the LED and the dimmer switch, but I cannot find any information on what switch would be compatible other than that the switch needs to be compatible with LEDs.  For good measure, I wired in a different dimmer switch that I had purchased for a different room in the house and saw the exact same behavior.  Does anyone have experience with an issue like this, or have any ideas how to solve it?",

      "selftext": "Okay,first of all,I'm glad this kind of thread is around on reddit!\n\nSecond,lets time travel back a couple of weeks.\nA couple of weeks ago I had just completed my electrician practical exam (no idea what it's called in english),a full installation in a real house with real customers. Not the ones that's usually in a booth.\n\nEverything was fine,I did the final pieces of documentation,visually inspected and measured the newly installed system. Everything was fine. I had the exam council come over and approve it,and it got approved. So unofficially I'm an electrician now,but not officially,still haven't received my papers yet. But whatever,this Friday I got a text message from the customer saying,and I quote: \"The downlights in the kitchen turns off when we use the microwave oven and there's also no light in our downlights in our hallway and in the bathroom on our second floor when we use the oven.\"\n\nI stared at the text message while the sun was shining and the clock showed that it was time go home. I stared at the text some more and I was litterally like wtf and went home (it was actually overtime so yeah).\n\nI googled \"microwave oven shutting down LED downlight\" and some other variations but I found nothing. Is it possible that the microwave frequencies is actually interferring with the LED drivers? As far as I can understand though microwave ovens are built so that the frequencies they produce won't interfer with other frequencies. So that's my guess anyway,that it's the frequency fucking the LED drivers up. Maybe place them further away from the microwave oven? *sigh* the extra work now that it's so neatly installed.\n\nThe second part of the text was the most bizarre one,no lights in the LED downlights in the hallway nor the 2nd floor bathroom when they use the oven. I'm thinking that the downlights just shut down at the wrong time,making them think it's the oven....But that may be the new dimmer I replaced (old ones weren't compatible with the downlights even though the producer said so) which is somehow fucking them up *sigh* \n\nFacts:\nBathroom LED downlights is on a 15A circuit breaker\nHallway LED downlights is on a 15A circuit breaker\nOven is a 25A 3~+N circuit breaker (it's a HUGE ass oven when you're considering it's only for a household,15kw,isn't that close to something they'd use in a small bakery or something xD? )\nMicrowave oven is on a 15A circuit breaker,so probably around 2,9-3kw\nThe downlights in the kitchen is built in to the kitchen cabinet,with the LED drivers mounted inside the cabinet about 1-1,5m from the microwave oven\n\nDimmers: http://www.ledshopen.se/exxact-transistordimmer-gle-315w.php   315w Exxact transistordimmer,it's universal so it shouldn't mess up those LED downlights though...Sorry for it being swedish,can't find the freakin' thing in any english site. ffs.\n\nDownlights in hallway and bathroom: http://www.sg-as.no/en/product/junistar-soft-matte-white-10w-led-3000k-cl-ii-230v/   \nI can't remember the brand on the built-in kitchen cabinet downlights,but they're each 2w,8 of them divided on 2 LED drivers. Each driver could handle about 12 or 14w I believe it was. Can't remember anything beyond that.\nOh,and the local system is a TN one,TN-C into the house and TN-C-S in the house.\n\nIn any case I'll still be going up there first thing on Monday after I've heard with my boss about this and check it out but it's always helpful to have more opinions on what it might be beforehand.\n\nEDIT: The dimmer on the built-in kitchen downlights is not the one I posted but this one,and it has been compatible with the drivers until (presumably) that Friday. Still it's minimum capac. is 20w as well lol. http://www.elektroimportoren.no/dimmer-rs16-315-gle-ph-elko/1471444/Product.html?gclid=Cj0KEQjw-OCqBRDXmIWvveLE3_cBEiQAZWfImW98nNEG_3zSj3EnPs0Eswq7CnqSVncfMH_NsSZDDAwaAt8H8P8HAQ\n",

Me and my fiancé bought an apartment this summer and after a couple of months we noticed the lightbulbs startet to flicker in all of the ceiling lamps. Since these were the bulbs that came with the apartment we just assumed that they were used up so we changed them and then about 3 months after the same problem startet. They always slowly start to flicker more and more until they essentially die. Except the bedroom where it just blinks a few times a day. Now I know this can be a problem with LED lightbulbs which is what we have now, but at least where we live they have cut out halogen lightbulbs so its harder and harder to get so we need to make it work with LEDs.\n\nI’ve heard that just changing the dimmer can help if it isn’t compatible with LED lightbulbs so thats what we’ve thought about. But we don’t know how to check and see if we have the wrong type of dimmers. And we figured we wanted to check if it was a simple fix like this before going to an electrician.\n\nSo if anyone has tips we would greatly appreciate it! I can probably add a picture in the comments if that helps.  \n\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention that the LED lightbulbs are dimmable.",

      "selftext": "Hi all - \n\n4-5 years ago I had undercabinet LED tape lights installed and they were problematic from the get-go: flickering, on/off, etc.\n\nI start looking into it this weekend and here is what I find:\n\n1. Magnitude Lighting LED Magnetic Driver - P/N M60L24DC-AR 60W Maximum. Input: 120 VAC 60hz black/white Output: 24VDC. I found the original box and it says \"USE ONLY WITH MAGNETIC LOW VOLTAGE DIMMER SWITCH\" (pictured)\n2. I then look at the wall switch that's installed, and it's a regular on/off switch. Behind it, it's connected to 2 wires coming out from the wall.  (pictured)\n\nI assume this switch isn't actually compatable so I went to the store and bought:\n\n1. Lutron \"DIVA\" DVLV-600P-WH - 600 VA / 450 W / 120 V / 60 hz Magnetic Low Voltage dimmer switch\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Am I correct in thinking that the regular on/off switch is the issue and that installing the MLV switch could fix it?\n2. In terms of installing the new switch, it has 2 black wires and also a green one (i assume is the ground?). Does the ground need to be hooked up to anything? (the new switch is not pictured as it's still in the box)\n\nAny advice would be most appreciated!  \n\n\n[existing on\\/off switch](https://preview.redd.it/63xth4hv1r041.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=580b9a973e1893ed86b546f669db4a334e687c24)\n\n[existing on\\/off non-dimmable switch \\(on the right\\). the switch on left is for recessed overhead ceiling lights that are functioning properly.](https://preview.redd.it/wlih87hv1r041.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e84128f500b2a045fdc0c28735769f09b2be4f19)\n\n[existing driver box](https://preview.redd.it/5jkw77hv1r041.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d8ff4717b93182c1d52852d7e55e0c5bfbe44f93)\n\n[picture of the existing undercabinet lighting with only a portion of the led tape working.](https://preview.redd.it/f8rxz8hv1r041.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f0fec167382598f1889959415a2918593f6b8c64)",

It gives the driver full unmodified sine waves so if that's giving you issues, it's certainly not going to help to put the transformer on a dimmer, even if it's MLV.  In my experience, dimming LED drivers, be it ELV or MLV just adds an extra layer of shit that can go wrong and cause flickering.  At least in your case, the driver has DC output because in cases where you have a magnetic transformer (ie. AC output) and the LED lights have their own built in driver like LED MR-16 bulbs, dimming them is a huge hassle. \n\nSo anyway, the cause could be the LEDs themselves that aren't behaving...maybe they're failing, wrong voltage, overloading the driver, etc.",

When I slide the dimmer up to full brightness, there’s a momentary  “surge” and then the bulbs dim back down maybe 5%.

I have played with the little adjuster on the side of the dimmer to no avail.\n\nEverything  appears compatible. I’m well within the wattage limits of the dimmer.  The light fixture says max 75w bulbs, and I have 100w LED equivalents in there, but they only pull 17.5w/each.\n\nWhat  could be causing this behavior? It’s not that bad; however, I’d like to  get all the lumens that I paid for out of those bulbs.\n\nThanks for any assistance!\n\nEDIT:  Another symptom I noticed—as I ride the dimmer up, it will surge to full brightness so long as the dimmer is being pushed upwards. As soon as the dimmer stops moving, it settles back to 90%.",

Panel issue, or neutral issue.\n\nFind the circuit breaker that room is on and turn it off at the panel, then check what else is off all around the house...with the intent to map out which outlets and switches are on that circuit. Sometimes you'll find multiple bedrooms on the same circuit, and it's not uncommon to have them on 15 amp circuits. Mislabeled circuits in the panel are also not uncommon.\n\nOnce you know for sure what is on that circuit and what isn't. Try the humidifier on a different circuit. If you keep getting the flickering on more than just the led light across multiple circuits I'd call a reputable electrician to explore the issue and inspect the homes electrical system and panel box. It could be absolutely nothing to worry about, but it could also be a sign of an issue that needs to be addressed and corrected. With electricity it's best to be safe, and proactive rather than reactive.\n\nAnother thing you can try is running a vacuum cleaner on different circuits around the house to check for more flickering. Flickering itself can sometimes be completely normal and harmless. I.e. If they have the lights and outlets on the same circuit, flickering can be unavoidable. Flickering is only really concerning if its because of a neutral or panel issue.",

      "selftext": "Hello electricians,\n\nI've got a bit of a mystery on my hands that I'm hoping you can solve.\n\nI recently completed a complete studs-out remodel on my house which included a full replacement of the electrical system (all the 1924 KnT was removed and all wiring/panels/outlets/lighting is brand new).\n\nI installed LED lighting throughout the house; all of the bulbs claim to be dimmable (for A19, I've got https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CAL1LKO, for BR30 I've got https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014392H0O).  I've installed a the HomeSeer HS-WD100+ dimmers on nearly every light.  The bulbs claim to be dimmable; the dimmers claim to be LED compatible.\n\nMaybe it'd help if I describe the fickering that I was seeing; it looks almost like what you'd see from one of those cheap battery-powered candles.  In other words, it's not a steady flicker; it's not near 60Hz, much slower than that as I can clearly see it.  The light will get flash brighter then dimmer with a seemingly random pattern.  It's super annoying.  Now, I know that some flickering is common with LEDs and certain dimmers, but this issue is a bit more interesting than that.\n\nI've had cases where I'll have one light (for example, the single can light in my shower) set to a medium dim with no flickering, and then turn on another light on the same circuit (the adjacent closet, for example) also to a medium dim and they'll both start flickering.  If I turn one off, the other one will often stop flickering.\n\nI'm fairly certain I've seen this happening for lights on different circuits... that one seems stranger to me.\n\nThis morning, I was planning to do some investigation/note-taking to see if I could find any interesting patterns/combinations so I could reproduce it and talk to my electrician.  I COULD NOT get this to reproduce anywhere in the house despite being plagued by it for the past few weeks.\n\nMy line of thinking has now shifted to \"what's changed between the last few weeks and today?\" and I've got a few theories that I'm hoping to run by this crowd.\n\n  - The last few weeks were bitterly cold and very dry here (Seattle); this week has been warmer and wet.\n      - Perhaps there's an issue with my house ground where it's grounded better now that the soil is wet... they did have to dig up my sewer line right next to that grounding rod before I moved in, maybe it didn't get reinstalled properly.\n      - Perhaps because it's been warmer the heat system is running less often; maybe there's some noise being introduced by the circulator pump (I've got a hydronic heat system downstairs) or my minisplit (upstairs).\n  - Maybe when I ran my tests this morning the fridge's compressor wasn't running and it was on other days/times when I saw the flickering.  I can't think of any other electrical systems in the house that would have been running and introducing noise; the only other things plugged in are cell phone chargers and a Tivo.\n\nDo any of those theories hold merit?  Any other ideas?",

I've heard about how some smart switches leak current through when turned off, which might be enough to make this happen, but this is a regular dumb switch. So maybe it's capacitively coupling some current through, (I guess that can happen) but why is it just happening now and not any time over the past year? \nTo try to fix this in the short term, I took the advice of others on thos sub and replaced one of the lights with a plain ol' 60w incandescent bulb to try to shunt the leakage power, but it had no effect! How the heck can I get these bulbs to stop flickering, so I don't have to flip the breaker just to get some sleep! And why might this happen now, suddenly, and not go away?",

Currently I have a new home, with a 3 gang box consisting of 2 single pole switches and a dimmer switch. The single pole switches controls the outside lights. Inside the box is a cluster of white wires, not connected to anything but leading from 3 romex pairs, presumably neutral cluster. There are two black wires going to each single pole switch. I've used a volt meter to test which line is \"hot\". There is also a ground wire for each switch. Initially I tried using an incandescent bulb timer - Honeywell RPLS730B1000. I connected line cluster, load, neutral cluster and ground wires to the timer. Turned on the fuse box and it seemed that the timer was powered but the light did not go on and off! WTF*(&\n\nMy first question is:\nIs this what you'd expect using the wrong type of timer? I have since purchased the Honeywell RPLS740B ( LED/CFL compatible). \nMy second question is:\nWould it be possible to wire TWO single pole switches to the same timer? Seems foolish to have two timers doing the same thing?\n\nThank you\n\n\n",

All 10 are in ceiling fan fixtures using brand new Lutron Skylark CFL/LED compatible dimmers.  In 2 of the 4 fixtures (one holds 2 bulbs, the other holds 3), I get a random flicker.  Sometimes it happens minutes apart, sometimes hours.  Other times, it will flicker repeatedly for up to a minute before it stops.  When it flickers, the bulbs will flicker off and on rapidly.  All the bulbs in the fixture will flicker in unison.  This happens whether the bulbs are on full brightness or dimmed.  I have different brands of LEDs in the house including some of the older style Cree bulbs and have never experienced this until now.  This is the first time I have had LEDs in these particular fixtures though.  The 2 ceiling fans having the problem are different models.  ",

      "selftext": "I did a search for other posts about LED strips, which helped a lot, but I really really don't want to die in a fire, so I'd be grateful for any feedback on my plans. Please let me know if I should be posting this elsewhere.\n\nI'm planning to put led strips along the perimeter of my living room ceiling. After some research I realized one strip of leds in series would be way too long... and I was also hoping they would be dimmable.\n\nSo now, here's my new plan.\n\n* An electrician has already installed a [dimmer switch](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Lutron-Skylark-150-Watt-Single-Pole-3-Way-Preset-CFL-LED-Dimmer-White-SCL-153PH-WH/205341522?MERCH=REC-_-PIPHorizontal1_rr-_-100399014-_-205341522-_-N) (Lutron, compatible with LEDs, 150W)  wired to a wall outlet by the ceiling. I had this done before realized I couldn't just plug in one long string, so I'm hoping to not change this part.\n\n* I'm planning to get a magnetic LED driver/transformer like [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/NEW-MODALIGHT-MP82-277v-150W-12V-LED-DRIVER-DIMMABLE-MAGNETIC-TRANSFORMER-277V-/251902864311?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item3aa694abb7). There's no plug so I would need to attach one (does a lamp wire work here?) so it can plug into the outlet. Do I need anything else here, or is there a better choice?\n\n* Then, I would wire the [LED strips](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005GL5UG2?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00) to the power supply in parallel. The strips take 12V, 1.5W/ft, and are 16.4ft long each. They make plug and go type of connectors if you use the cheaper power adapter, but I'm guessing that won't work here. What kind of wire should I use for this?\n\n[Here's a diagram](http://imgur.com/OfalZG8) to help illustrate what's going on.",

They should be sized at 80% max.\n\n200W is about 80% so in theory you’re right at what I perceive is the max.\n\nI have the same issue with trimless lights on a Lutron DVCL 153P that I believe we had to upgrade to the larger wattage version I forget the model #\n\nIt has a slight buzz. It should come and go as you dim and brighten the lights. But I would personally split the lighting load into another dimmer and save yourself a headache in the future while the ceiling etc looks open\n\n20 lights is not only a lot of lights in general, it’s a lot for any 1 dimmer to handle imo.\n\nAlso try to get the next wattage up dimmer and see if you have the same result. I would def at least get another switch leg up into the ceiling and give yourself the option of splitting it later if you’re unsure.\n\nEdit: I actually think that the 250W diva dimmer is the largest wattage they make on the Diva Series, and maybe in general for Lutron. The 153p commonly used is 150W and the 250 is next size up",

      "selftext": "Going to my light i have switched power and straight power. Can someone help me understand the instructions on this one? Pictured is the led driver that came with the light. I was given an emergency driver to hook up to this light. I'm also wiring up 0 to 10 v dimming wires to the fixture. The instructions are telling me to hook wires up to ac positive and ac negative which I don't think I have. I have line, neutral, and ground. Also + and - for 0 to 10v. Then I have my led output + and - terminals which I'm not sure what to do with. Not even sure I'm following the right diagram. I'm following the \"dimming diagram\" but now wondering if I should be following the 2 wire diagram? Thanks for any input",

Changing incoming voltage doesn't effect the setpoint, so the only thing that happens with voltage drop is the switching frequency of AC to DC goes up a little bit to keep the output constant. Light output stays the same, current goes up and damage can occur if too low, only designed for a range.\n\nThe ones that are dimmer compatible are looking for the chopped up waveform from a regular triac dimmer, they use that to modify their setpoint, lowering the DC side.",

The electronics inside LED dimmers need a certain amount of power running through them to function, and your maximum of 5w is not enough for their minimum.\n\nThis is a common issue we get when people ask for a dimmer on 1 single recessed light. No, you can't, because your single 7w light isn't enough to dim.\n\nYou can TRY with a better dimmer, like a Lutron ELV dimmer, which will run you closer to like $80.

I don't know if I'm just hyper sensitive or what but I am a day away from swapping all of my bulbs back to incandescent.\n\nI am betting this is a subtle issue with the quality of power coming into the house. New panel, new line from the power company, new metering can, new everything and I have flipping flicker on dimmed LEDs.\n\nDoes anyone here have any idea what I should do next?",

In my experiments using my S9+ to view bulbs in pro camera mode, and playing with the 'shutter/appeture' settings, I found my standard 806lm colour bulbs that come with the starter kit strobe like crazy, however the pure white 1600lm bulb does not show any signs of flicker. I did think about replacing all my bulbs with the 1600lm white ones, but the downside is they don't dim down as low as the 806lm bulbs, they have a brighter minimum setting basically. Hope that helps someone. So I'm still searching for smart, dimmable (via app) flicker free solutions, if anyone can recommend something please do, they don't need to be super bright or rgb, but dimmable to a good level is most important. I know there's some non-smart eyecare type ones from Philips and those look great but I'd like smart if possible.",

      "selftext": "First let me make this clear, THERE IS NO DIMMER on the circuit. None! \n\nI have a room (The Den) that has [4x Sylvania 6\" 16w Microdisks LEDs.](https://assets2.ledvanceus.com/media/bin/asset-8631388) (LEDMD62A1200ST9SC3) All four lights flicker. Originally there was a Smart Dimmer switch on this circuit when the previous recessed can lights were there. But during the remodel the can lights had to go and the only solution that would work was these microdisks.\n\nThe previous LED lights in the cans did not flicker (for the most part). It wasn't until we moved to these microdisks that they started to flicker. \n\n* Here is [a picture of the circuit](https://imgur.com/6naooQM)  \n* [First light after the switch](https://imgur.com/VgQ4klb)  \n* [Up close shot of connectors](https://imgur.com/TmanZPZ)\n\nNow this circuit is right off the breaker (located in the same room). It leaves the breaker and hits a junction box that splits into two runs. One run goes to the Den the other to the Hallway/Guest Room. NOTE: The Hallway/Guest Room does not experience this issue. Only the Den. \n\nHere is all that I have done to troubleshoot. \n\n* Replace Dimmer with a standard smart switch - Still Flickers\n* Replace Standard Smart Switch with a standard toggle switch - Still Flickers\n* Removed Hallway/Guest Room Run at junction box. - Still Flickers\n* Verified that all connections on the Microdisks are firm (Ideal In-Sure Connectors) - Still Flickers\n* Ran a 12/2 wire from Junction Box to Toggle Switch to make sure wiring in wall isn't the issue. - Still Flickers\n* Removed up to three microdisks (drivers still connected) - Still Flickers  \n* Removed all but ONE microdisk and driver - Still Flickers.\n* Bypass wiring from switch to first light - Still flickers. \n\nI'm running out of things I can test and honestly very perplexed by this. My next thing I am going to try is to see if I can reach either the second or third light in the circuit and bypass the first light. Maybe that light is defective and is causing the issues for everyone else.  \n\nThoughts?",

I replaced it for an LED, and the LED will strobe every half second. I though it was related to the photocell in the lamp, so I bypassed the sensor.\n\n2nd problem: now the incandescent light works just fine (this is the setting I currently have), I was so sure I had a workaround so I replaced the bulb to the LED. Now the problem is that the LED is permanently ON, I can see the led embedded in the wall switch showing on/off but the bulb is permanently ON.\n\nNext thing I do: I replaced the dimmer for a regular mechanical switch. Now when the switch is off the bulb keeps some ghosting current and it doesn’t go fully off. Switch ON: light 100%, switch OFF: light is about 5-10%. \n\nThe wiring inside the junction box is not straightforward, even though this is a simple light, NO  3-way, 1 terminal comes from 2 different cables (black wire) the other terminal comes from a 3rd cable, also black wire. \n\nThis is puzzling me, any clues what could be the problem?",

You need to install a “dimmer bypass” which is a resistor intended specifically for this purpose.  Just like with LED blinker bulbs for cars.  The blinker with think the bulb is burnt out because there is no load on the blinker circuit.  To fix this, you have to add a resistor to create a load so your blinker doesn't blink really fast.

I also have an older APC surge protector that produces the same result.\n\nI have one of those Klein Tools outlet testers and it indicates correct wiring.\n\nI am having an electrician come take a look, but was curious to ask in case anybody here has some advice.\n\nThe dimmer switches are Lutron’s and are indeed meant for LEDs. I do not know the make or model of the pot lights, only that they are LEDs.\n\nThank you.",

This behavior can include flickering, reduced dimming range, flashing when off, or not even working at all.\n\nDimmers that are designed for incandescent loads tend to have a larger minimum load requirement because incandescent fixtures generally have higher wattages than LED fixtures.  This means that these dimmers will most likely require multiple LED fixtures to meet the minimum load requirement. Testing is necessary to determine the exact number of LED fixtures needed for each incandescent dimmer.  Dimmers that are designed for LED loads usually have a lower minimum load requirement and typically only require one or two fixtures.  The LED minimum load rating for LED load dimmers is usually given in number of lamps instead of Watts (W) or Volt Amps (VA).  “\n\nhttps://www.lightingservicesinc.com/about-us/blog/5247/minimum-and-maximum-dimmer-loads-for-led-fixtures",

In the photo, it only showed two wires on the switch, so I thought it'd be easy.  In reality, the switch has a red wire, white wire, and a black wire.  The instructions say to attach the wires directly to the LED pos and neg wires, and then the third wire is the ground. \n\nThe spot I want to install the wire is, in fact, only on the pos wire for the entire circuit, as it runs to the LEDs.  Am I screwed? Also, the instructions say installing the dimmer across DC will burn it out instantly.\n\n**TL;DR:** Install LED dimmer with access to only the positive wire leading to several LED lights in parallel.  Possible or impossible?\n\nEDIT: I was just overthinking it. Called the manufacturer and it was easy as pie. I'm thrilled to have it working now. Thanks for helping!",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nBought a house and we're doing lots of renovation, including replacing all of the knob and tube. The electrician and his crew are doing the majority of the work, and I'll be following up with odds and ends (I'm comfortable with basic wiring).\n\nAfter more than an hour of web searching, and calling my local electrical supply house, I am not able to find the style of dimmer I want to buy like 6 of: **a toggle dimmer that can drive dimmable LEDs, without that stupid little nubbin slider on the side**.\n\nI like these because they can act as on/off switches, or as dimmers, without either function really impeding the other. (The very-common style (Lutron's [Ariadni line](https://www.lutron.com/en-US/Products/Pages/StandAloneControls/Dimmers-Switches/Ariadni-TogglerDimmer/ModelNumbers.aspx#SectionHead1) is a good example) that many manufacturers carry, with a big toggle, and little nearby slider, is annoying to me: if you have it dimmed down, and switched off, the next user will flip it on thinking the lights will go all the way on, *and they will be wrong*. That's dumb. The single-toggle-does-everything solves the problem.)\n\nIt appears that [this GE-branded (actually made by Jasco) dimmer](https://byjasco.com/ge-single-pole-toggle-dimmer-light-almond) is functionally what I'm looking for—but it has [poor reviews on Amazon which make it look unreliable, cheap, or not so good at dimming](https://www.amazon.com/GE-Switch-Dimmable-Incandescent-18025/dp/B002DNAG4W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&th=1).\n\nThere are a handful of other options I've found, by more trustworthy brands, which are only designed for use with incandescent bulbs, like [this Legrand T600W](https://www.legrand.us/wiring-devices/light-switches-and-dimmers/dimmers/trademaster-toggle-dimmer-brown/p/t600w), but of course these wouldn't work properly with LED lighting.\n\nDoes anybody know of a good option out there other than the Jasco part I found?\n\nThanks!",

Also, this will ensure that when you plug in your plug top, you will have live and neutral in the correct polarity, as with a two prong plug you could swap it around unintentionally and thus send neutral to the live connection and live to the neutral connection on the driver. \n\nThe bell wire should be fine to the bell press switch, it's not carrying much current if any, and simply acting as a switch. Just make sure your switch is a press switch, and not a 1 way switch. Press switch is the dimmer switch. \n\nI can not assist you with the Dali connection though as I do not know much about that.

I can use them independently if I wanted to. I’m able to connect them to a regular switch each just have to learn the other regular switch. So when I do that test when connected to the Maestro the lights will turn on the turn off I can’t keep them on unless I’m holding T and L. Which is the middle large middle button and the bottom right of the smaller dimmable buttons on the companion only. I did the same on the Maestro switch but it won’t light up the Leds lights. Like I said everything is well connected and tested it’s getting power but they won’t light up. Not sure if I can use more than one set of 3 way switches on the 15 amp breaker. Very irritating can’t figure it out. The instructions booklet doesn’t say anything about how many I can use on the same circuit. Not sure if more than one are compatible....",

      "selftext": "As it takes quite a while to get the services of an electrician I’m posting here in the hope that a good soul can help me.\n\nAs I’ve moved to a new house and noticed the estimation for electricity consumption, naturally I’ve decided to change my halogen bulbs (25 of them) to LEDs. The setup that I have has:\n\n- Jung 1224 LED UDE universal dimmer such as the ones [here](https://shop.bouwhof.nl/products/jung-univ-4011377143197?variant=40946391023792&currency=EUR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&utm_campaign=gs-2021-05-06&utm_source=google&utm_medium=smart_campaign&gclid=CjwKCAiA1uKMBhAGEiwAxzvX9_4vvFAkLFUNGRWG-xn0tsPPX46YiLbAnXRt8Sdbt3cJiskpywqwLxoCNYIQAvD_BwE). A photo of [mine](https://imgur.com/a/kyDqzd3).\n\n- Aurora Alu111 spot lights like [this one](https://www.ledbulbs.co.uk/products/aurora-alu111-adj-single-multiple-ss-au-mar111ss). The important aspect of it it’s the transformer it comes with, which is an Aurora AU-E60 like [this one](https://www.cef.co.uk/catalogue/products/202335-10-60w-va-premium-electronic-transformer). A photo of [mine](https://imgur.com/a/YGUoqpk). \n\n- Finally, I’ve replaced the existing OSRAM 41835 12V 50Watt (like [this one](https://www.lampdirect.nl/osram-41835-halospot-111-50w-12v-g53-fl-24d-4050300011769?gclid=CjwKCAiA1uKMBhAGEiwAxzvX9-1LUn7nHU2x1Tw01CX1CF1qBnNQWc2iEzaGY8XSRmAk71BMph72ABoCnscQAvD_BwE)) with Philips LEDspot ExpertColor G53 AR111 (MASTER) 11W 927 40D like [this one](https://www.lampdirect.nl/philips-ledspot-expertcolor-g53-ar111-master-11w-927-24d-beste-kleurweergave-vervangt-50w-8718699686925?gclid=Cj0KCQiAkNiMBhCxARIsAIDDKNXiFbWh0aP3huShMxXsuiKyx_VhiHfJY5mntttXqabpqRBux7dMN7gaAndmEALw_wcB). \n\nNow all works fine, leds are dimmable and there are no problems. However, lately I’ve read about invisible led flickering (flickering of LEDs that is only visible with slow motion camera) and that it might be harmful for the eyes. While my leds have no flickering with the naked eye or on a regular video, they do with slow motion (video [here](https://imgur.com/a/5IqzGhn). \n\nAs much as I’ve searched I could not find an answer if this is normal behavior or it’s something wrong in my system. The only thing I can think of replacing is probably the transformer with a better one, but that’s something I need an electrician for. Either way I ve seen that transformers are about 20-30E each and changing all of them is quite something. \n\nSorry for the long post, but if anyone got this far, what I’m trying to understand is if this transformers are suitable for LED or should I put the halogen bulbs back. If I have to change the transformers I’d probably change the whole thing to have main voltage Leds (directly 230V) with no transformers and change also the fitting from G53 tu GU10.\n\nAny advice is appreciated, thanks!",

(Think of that as how wide the \"pipe\" is, and voltage as the amount of pressure pushing on the water flowing through the pipe.  The higher the pressure, or the wider the pipe, the more total power.)  Now, if you connect a 12V load that draws just a small amount of current, the power supply won't be affected.  It has more than enough available.  It doesn't FORCE surplus current anywhere.

          "body": "No problem. Thanks for not blaming the sparky! The vast majority of us would love to install top quality parts everywhere, but installing high end dimmers and bulbs that work well can cost more than you might think. \n\nIn case you are curious, the root of the problem is the LED chips themselves. Unlike incandescents that will just dim down with less voltage, LED chips have a very narrow voltage range that they will work with. So dimming by reducing the voltage will just cause them to flicker, or not work at all. \n\nInstead, led dimmers basically switch the power on and off faster than your eye can see, which makes the light appear less bright. Some led drivers handle that well, some do not. The exact methods used vary, so certain dimmers will work better with certain LED bulbs and fixtures. The specific products available change constantly, so it's nearly impossible to keep up on what works well.",

I had the green wired to the bare copper in the housing, the red wired to the white and the black wired to black.  When I flipped the switch to on, I heard a pop, the lights remained in the 'dim' setting however and I was unable to turn them completely off. After removing the new switch I inspected the circuit board and it appears to have a burn in on the corners.\n\nShould I try replacing the switch again? Any other suggestions? Thank you",

I finally decided to swap them out for smart LEDs because I love the convenience of being able to turn things on and off by voice, and most of the rest of my house is controlled this way now. \n\nI bought a set of 4 BR30 Teckin bulbs from Amazon (yes, they're smaller bulbs than my BR40s, but I don't mind the can being a bit less filled out) ([https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZFSW1YJ/ref=ppx\\_od\\_dt\\_b\\_asin\\_title\\_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZFSW1YJ/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)) and installation was going great until I put the 4th bulb in. For some reason, that last bulb made my dimmer switch start buzzing/humming. The switch was fine with 3 bulbs in it, so I'm wondering if it may be a bulb issue or if it's a switch issue. I don't think I'm overloading the switch (I mean, I'm not sure if that's really a thing - I know less than nothing about electrical wiring), since the bulbs are only 13w, which is way, way less than the 65w incandescents that I first replaced with LEDs, but I'm worried that it could be dangerous because electrical things shouldn't hum, right?\n\nAnyone had a similar experience or know what the issue might be? This is an old house built in the 50's, so the electrical wiring isn't the best to begin with (and there are no neutral wires, which is why I went with smart bulbs instead of a smart switch), so I don't know if that factors in as well, but again, the hum/buzz only began with the installation of that 4th bulb. \n\nThanks in advance!",

When I went to swap it out this is what I found. \n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Jy373II\n\nThere is wire running to a spot that says “common” with the different colored screw, like a three way. There are two black wires stabbed into the top of the switch, one runs over to the switch that operates my porch light. \n\nI installed a Lutron DIVA as a three way, based on the “common” line back there, but then the porch light didn’t work.

Found this on Google:\n\nJust follow these steps:\n\nSwitch the light on and set to the minimum brightness.\n\nTurn the light off and on three times, leaving a second in between each press.\n\nThe lights will go up and down in brightness to show the dimmer is in configuration mode before going off.\n\n-Turn the dimmer fully clockwise. As soon as the light comes on, start to adjust the minimum brightness and leave at the desired level. It will be saved after three seconds\n\nUse as normal.\n\n\n\nGood luck!",

The LED cans were on a Lutron LED dimmer, which it’s my intent to reuse with the strip. In my phots this dimmer is swapped for a standard single pole switch for troubleshooting purposes. I have the wall switch run to a MeanWell PWM-40-24 power supply, which I purchased along with the lights from SBL after calculating the wattage needed based on the length of the run. \n\nUnfortunately, I’m not sure what I have hooked up wrong, but I’m unable to get the strip to light up. Hoping somebody can shed some light on my issue (get it?).\n\nPhotos:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/POmebft",

Right now we have awful fluorescent lights that buzz and flicker, just awful. Elsewhere in the studio we have LED lights that we're very happy with and now want to install them in our main recording room but I want to find a configuration that will not produce the common dimmer buzz. \n\nHere's the set up: \nWe have a 1000sqft main room with 20' ceilings. Our plan is to have our electrician friend install 4x8' tracks, with each track supporting 4 LED light heads. Each track goes to a dimmer so it can be controlled independently of one another. \n\nOur friend is a professional commercial electrician with many years experience at a big company. He's confident that all dimmers will make some noise because of the voltage conversion, and if not the dimmer then the transformer in the LED bulb will. The man at Home Depot lighting department assured me that the new dimmers and bulbs are quiet but he's 70+ and may not hear it. Before we move ahead with this I wanted to put it to you. You're help is greatly appreciated. ",

But sidebar doesnt say anything about asking these types of questions so here I go.\n\nI have Lutron switches from sometime in the last 20 years (were here before i moved in). Mostly used with halogen and incandescent. I put in LED lights. They dim (about 50%), no buzz, no flicker... overall they function as Id like. \n\nI am wondering if there is any downsides to keep using it like that as opposed to getting newer Lutron switches that support CFL and LED dimming (C.L. with HED technology as Lutron calls them)?\n\nWill newer tech dimmers let me save more power (at same dimness as old style switches)? \n\nOn the engineering side of things, I understand that the new dimmers will lower the LED flashing rate, thereby producing less light... while older ones put a load across a variable resistor. How does this work with LEDs? do they continue to blink same number of times per second but now due to lower current they are just not as bright? How does that translate to power usage?\n\nAlso at full power (non dimmed), would there be a difference between old style dimmer and newer tech dimmer?\n\nThanks!",

The drop ceiling is very close to the above floor joists, so the electricians went with a surface mounted LED unit (Philips 5\" round surface mount, model# S5R927K7) The lights look great, but damn, they are bright. At the beginning of the job estimate, I specified I wanted dimmer switches, but that detail was forgotten, and I came home to find toggles. No big deal, I asked for dimmers again, and the electrician switched them out with Lutron Ariadni 600W incandescent dimmer toggles( they need to be toggles because they are part of a 2 switch plate). Now the bulbs have a buzz(which changes with dimmer sliding). My first thought was, I'll just trade out the switches for 1,000W dimmers, but after research, it seems 600W is as high as I can go for this particular style and LED. So now I'm looking at Lutron Toggler LOw Voltage Magnetic switch. Only because that's my search result when I type buzzing led bulbs lutron dimmer etc.  Seems counter intuitive to go low voltage, because the first thing I read said the buzzing was from the combination of all the lights in the room not getting enough juice while the dimmer is strobing the lights. \nIs there a simple fix? Can I just go to Home Depot or Lowes and get a different switch? Philips website is of no help, it's all schematics and no mention of switches for these particular units (that I can find)",

      "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI am completely unfamiliar with wiring and figured I would pick a project that even a newbie like me couldn't mess up.  Perhaps I was wrong.\n\nI wanted to build a very simple under-cabinet LED light to grow some countertop herbs.  I built the light and was stoked that it worked; however, after two weeks of run time, the lights are significantly dimmer, putting out a yellow rather than pure white color closer to the power source, and emitting a quiet buzzing noise (like in older fluorescent fixtures).  \n\nThis is what I did:\n\n* I purchased a 5m strip of 6540 LEDs ([these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FFWQEPW/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1)) which came with the appropriate 12V/5A adapter.  \n* I cut the strips into 6 segments at the cut points and attached them to an insulated plywood backing.  Due to the length of the board vs. the length of the cut points, ~8 total LED lights were omitted from the project.\n* I soldered the strips back together using 18-gauge wire.  This was my first soldering project and I had a bit of trouble, but did do some practice beforehand on scraps.  I am positive I didn't cross any leads (all + went to + and all - to -).\n\nThe light worked great for a while and looked just as bright as before I cut it up and soldered it.  Now it's dim, humming, and some of the LEDs are noticeably yellow.\n\nWhat did I do wrong, and how can I fix it?\n\nThanks in advance!",

This seems more like a place for professionals than people like me, but I'll give it a shot anyways. Please remove my post if it doesn't belong!\n\nI just got a LED dimer switch (Lutron) and I wanted to put it on this afternoon. I removed the wall place and it looks like my switches are wired with 14 gauge wire (it's a 15 amp circuit). My lutron dimmer has a black box attached to it and all 4 wires (it's a 3-way dimmer) coming out are 16 gauge. The installation guide that comes with the dimer says to use wire nuts to connect all 4 wires with what's inside my light switch box.\n\nI did a quick google search, and I'm more confused than I was before. So I guess my question is... Is it OK to connect the 14-gauge wire from my light switch box to the 16-gauge wire from the dimmer? If not, is there anything I can do besides just getting another dimmer?\n\nThanks!",

I'm lazy :( )\n\nI'd rather not change the switch out or do anything big as I'm technically not allowed to.\n\nI heard that some dimmers have something behind them that can change that minimum current? I forgot to bring a philip with me so I'll check that over the next weekend or weekend after that. But any suggestions?\n\nThanks!\n\nUS. I can snap some pics if needed, but it would probably be just of the dimmer on the wall lol.. Brand unknown.",

The fourth dimmer switch we would like to connect to LEDs under the counters- most led products are plugged and come with a driver with their own dimmer which I’m guessing would be incompatible with our dimmer set up- does anyone have any bright ideas about what products we could use? I’m guessing we could put individual dimmable leds underneath but a strip would be preferable.\n\nAlso I know that regs require a qualified electrician to install in a kitchen which we’ll get, I just want to find a suitable product first.\n\nCheers!",

This flickering will coincide with intermittent buzzing on the phono input on my stereo. The phono preamp and preamp are on the same circuit as the dimmer. Here's what I've done so far to toubleshoot. \n1. Removed the dimmer and confirmed light flickering is gone but buzzing on stereo remains (source of buzzing is not the dimmer)\n2. Unplugged phono preamp and preamp and confirmed light flickering with dimmer remains (source of flickering is not phono preamp)\n3. Switched off every other breaker in the house and confirmed flickering/buzzing remains. \n4. Inspected every electrical connection at every outlet and light fixture on the circuit to confirm they were tight and secure (house is 4 years old, all copper wiring, 15A circuit with maybe a combined 2A load max).\n5. Tightened hot, neutral and ground connections for that circuit inside the main panel. Flickering/buzzing remain.\n6. Swapped circuit breakers in the panel and flickering/buzzing remain. \n\nAt this point I think the source of the interference if from outside the house. It does only happen sporadically.  There may be nothing for hours, sometimes I don't notice for days, then it shows up again.\n\nPlease help it's kinda driving me crazy at this point.",

I've already tried what you suggested and checked every connection on that circuit. All are tight. I've also confirmed that the dimmer is not the source of the flickering /noise but it is at least suceptible to it. I can hear a buzzing noise in sink with the flickering on two separate stereos on two separate circuits. The noise persists even if the dimmer is off or disconnected from the circuit.  I'm pretty sure that loose electrical connections would not cause this audible buzzing with long and short pulses through a stereo. There must be a source of noise on my electrical lines and I'm pretty sure it's from outside the house (as I stated I can hear it even with all other breakers in the house turned off).

The diodes themselves may last 50k hours but the rest sure won't.\n\nEdit, I can still remember the days when you basically had to choose between 60 watt or 100 watt bulbs that cost like a quarter a piece and either worked or didn't work. Many times a week now I see this exact issue with either CFL or led bulbs that cost way more and don't last as long. Don't get me wrong, I have only led in my house but I had to spend a lot to get the quality ones that will last.

We literally have a guy sometimes stand there and trigger the sensor just so we can work if the garage door won’t open.\n\nI see so many old folks homes where the garage is PACKED full of stuff, and I can imagine them walking in there looking for something and suddenly the lights go out.

In the days of filament lamps, controlling the current controlled the brightness, and even at minimum current there was still enough to operate the dimmer circuit, so the dimmer could be powered by the current flowing through the lamp (dimmer in series with the lamp, no neutral required).\n\nWith low-energy lamps, particularly LED which have their own driver circuits inside, dimming the lamp is a much more complex matter involving controlling the waveform going to the lamp. The current flowing through the lamp is now not suitable for powering dimmer electronics, so a neutral is required at the dimmer. \n\nIt's not just dimmers, but various timers, PIRs and other types of circuit which could be powered in series with a filament lamp and not need their own neutral now need a neutral at the switch.",

In a \"dumb\" switch or dimmer, you're just modifying the hot leg of the wire in some way to dim the light, but there are no electronics outside of the actual dimming mechanism that run.\n\nIn a smart dimmer, there's a little micro controller and some electronics to dim it, and communicate to the smart hub, and all that jazz.  Those electronics need to run and draw power at all times, even when the lights are off.  For them to draw power they need a neutral, or else there's no \"return\" path for the electricity.\n\nBack in the day when incandescent light bulbs were the norm, some dimmers didn't need a neutral because they would run their electronics through a circuit that leeched power off the main circuit.  The problem is when you do this, you have to send some power to the light bulb, like 1 watt.  If you send 1 watt to an incandescent light bulbs, it won't light up at all, it will just get a little bit warm.  With a CFL or LED bulb, even just 1 watt can cause the light to flicker, and it will do weird things.  In this case, the switch is kind of using the switch leg as a neutral.  I'm oversimplifying it, but hopefully you can understand what I'm saying.\n\nSo, new dimmers and smart switches need neutrals.  To run anything that uses power, you need an \"in\" (hot wire) and an \"out\" (neutral wire) in the circuit.  If there's no neutral, you can't run anything that draws power inside the switch, unless you do the trick mentioned above, that doesn't work on LED bulbs.",

Typically I’d use a standard led driver with a 24v led strip but I’m concerned about 1) voltage drop and 2) overloading the dimmer.  Lutron makes a 250W LED dimmer but I believe you need to de-rate if in a multi gang box.  Haven’t had to run this many watts of LED strip lighting on a single switch before.  \n\nAny recommendations for either 120v tape lights or a setup I can run off a 0-10V dimmer?  \n\nThanks in advance!",

          "body": "r/askelectricians is where you post questions. \n\nA capacitor whine is most likely the cause.  Disconnecting the fan doesn't stop that.  The capacitor is a solid state battery essentially and would continue to whine for a while since its whole purpose is to store charge.  They do that when they start failing but haven't kicked the bucket yet.  \n\nIt's likely in the start circuit of the fan.  I just bought a bathroom fan and the capacitor inside mine was a small black box with two yellow wires coming out of it.  One wire to the black line voltage wire from the switch, and the other directly to the motor.  \n\nIf you replace the capacitor inside (could be easy, or could be fully encased in the motor wiring), or the entire fan, the problem may go away.  Could also be a capacitor component in the LED fixture, but that seems less likely.\n\nHere's a test:  If it doesn't come back with them disconnected for a long period of time, at least 3 or 4 hours, then it's probably that.  If it does still happen, then there's something else up there that's still powered.  Anything not in one of those fixtures would be a code violation if that area is fully inaccessible.  Termination points aren't allowed outside of junction boxes (with accessible covers) or fully removable fixtures.  It's not impossible for there to be something else but it should be unlikely if your contractor wasn't a scumbag.",

          "body": "Ok, I'm probably not right and don't take offense, but hear me out. I work in measuring and resolving problematic noises (weird niche, long story). I went to someone's house. The husband and wife were certain there were noises coming from inside their walls or something. The high pitched squeals would come and go. It was driving them crazy. They were removing and disconnecting all kinds of electrical things. I couldn't hear it. Long story short, I used a high-quality instrumentation microphone and software (and other practical demonstrations to show that the noise didn't exist). The guy got super pissed off that I was implying that \"it was all in his head\", as his wife heard it too. They both just had tinnitus. When they were out in the world, there was enough background noise to mask it. When they got home and went into their quiet and isolated semi-rural home, then they would start hearing their own tinnitus. It got \"louder\" in their bathroom. An interior room even more isolated from outdoor noise sources, so less masking. Making the noises sound louder.\n\nLong story short... Just to rule that out. When you hear the noise, plug your ears with your fingers. If it doesn't go away, it's tinnitus. If the noise completely goes away, you have a real noise problem. \n\nSorry to bring it up, but I got to see someone spend months and thousands of dollars chasing a phantom high pitched squeal. Even as he was being pissed and scooting me out for denying that the noise was real, I asked him if his 20 year old son (who wasn't there at the time) heard the noise. He said his son didn't. Of course his young son had perfect young hearing and no tinnitus. He didn't want to hear that either. He didn't want to pay the consulting fee either.\n\nIf you have a real noise problem. download a free FFT app on your phone, something like one called \"Audio tools\". Put it into the FFT function. If it's a high pitch, it will show a sharp spike showing what frequency it is and things like if it has harmonics. An oscillating electronic circuit is probably going to have a very stable and unwavering frequency.  It can give clues to what is going on. If you get this far, screen shot what the FFT is showing and hit me up and maybe I can help point you at the problem. Good luck.",

The uppers, unders and toe kicks against the kitchen wall dim perfectly, but the toe kick on the kitchen island does not dim, only turning on and off like a standard toggle. I find this strange because the toe kicks on the wall cabinets and thr island oprate off of the same slider dimmer (14/2 switchleg from the dimmer up to an outlet in the attic, and another 14/2 from the attic outlet down the kitchen wall, under the slab and up into the island where it terminates to another plug). The wires in the attic are tied through and pigtailed to the outlet. I tried reolacing the transformer, and using a new LED strip, no dice. Am I missing something here? ",

Cost conscious since it’s all donations for every $ spent.\n\nThey have several different rooms, all with anywhere from 3-8 circuits per room getting wired in for lighting.\n\nEvery room has a mix of LED 120v AC fixtures (such as track lights) and some 120v LED linear fixtures or pendants that also use 0-10v DC dimming.\n\nDo you know of any non-commercial grade (not things that are commercial grade and require all kinds of expensive control modules like Lutron Maestro, Vive, Legrand Wattstopper) that could have separate dimmers to run this stuff?\n\nI was hoping for Caseta style items to also provide wireless control- but they dont seem to have dimmers for 0-10v lighting. \n\nDo you know of any consumer grade (&therefore consumer priced) systems that can do this?\n\nThanks!",

Replaced 2 bulbs and no flicker.\n\n3) Replaced all 4 bulbs with non-warm dim LED bulbs resulted in no flicker at 100% dim. When dimmed to 25%, lights flickered for a second before turning fully on.\n\n4) Replaced dimmer with toggle switch but keeping warm dim bulbs in resulted in no flicker.\n\nMy hypothesis: Warm dim combined with dimmer in adjacent room causes harmonics on the circuit enough to mess with other room LED bulbs. At least during the initial start up for the bulbs. Once they are on with no flicker, they are fine.\n\nI may just get get rid of the warm dim bulbs…",

      "selftext": "Alright, I've been working on one of the strangest problems of my career. I have a circuit in a customer's home that's tripping. This house is a long drive away and I've already spent several hours out there, so I'm hoping to brainstorm some ideas with y'all and get it right on my next visit.\n\nThere are three sets of 4-5 cans with LED bulbs in the kitchen, each with their own dimmer. Turning any of these switches on trips the breaker in 1.5-2 hours if the circuit has been off for a while, but it trips much faster if it's reset right after a trip. This makes total sense with residual heat.\n\nI have traced the circuit through the attic (which is unbelievably uncomfortable to work in). From the panel, it hits an 18x18 junction box with nearly every circuit in the house jointed, but this circuit is a 1 to 1 with old black romex 12/2 to the white romex 12/2 from the 80/90s. It then hits a single gang junction box with two yellow 12/2s splitting off. One goes to the kitchen switches and the other goes to a nest of numerous switches/plugs/junction boxes that have had some separate issues I've since resolved. I disconnected the nest of other stuff and the breaker still tripped with only the switches connected. I measured 7 Ohms of resistance while the circuit was tripping from black to neutral, but much higher than that normally.\n\nI traced that wire and didn't see any issues with the hot. I pulled the switch pop-in box out of the wall and took a video with my phone to see if there was any damage. There is a fire block, so I can't see about 2' of the wire between it and the top plate. I've pulled down most of the cans (I ran out of time and had to head to another job) and honestly, they were installed pretty well. I couldn't see any issues there. I am just stumped.\n\nIt's all three switches. It isn't tripping with them off. That alone seems to eliminate every normal problem I can think of. How could it be in a switch leg if it's all three? How could it be in the hot if the switches have to be on? My gameplan next visit is to replace the hot feeding the system (maybe there's a problem I didn't see that only shows up when current is being drawn?), replace the dimmers (Maybe they're all just bad and pulling extra power?), and check the rest of the cans (Maybe there's something in them I missed?). I'm not confident in a single solution I'm throwing at this problem, so hopefully a shotgun approach works. Any other ideas?",

Power begins in this octagon, drops down to a 3way at top of stairs (via a 14/2 romex).  Carries power down to a 3way at bottom of stairs via 14/3 romex.  Essentially a switch loop down on the white and back up on the black.  \nReplaced both switches.  No dimmers in play.  No illuminated switches in play.  When switch at top of stairs is removed and white/black of 14/2 is connected/disconnected light works perfectly.  Once switches are reconnected the issue reappears.  A pigtail with a single LED bulb in the foxtures place does not replicate the same issue as the original fixture.   Simple solution is to just replace the fixture but what is the underlying issue here?   Induction on the 3way portion?  Any thoughts?",

Could also be induction from the way the wires were ran, one of the biggest headaches with LED lighting is it's incredible efficiency means it can be extra sensitive to even the smallest loads. I've seen led experiments where they ground the cob and then have different environments (dry static, microwaves, emf) turning the cob on and off at various intensities. Wild stuff. Anyways check voltage neutral to ground if you have some may need to verify the connections all the way back to the panel and I would get your GEC resistance confirmed. From there you may just need to use a LUT-MLC or something in that fixture if it bothers you.",

      "selftext": "Where are you putting the power supplies? Class 2 is limited to 100W, which realistically means an ~80W power budget per circuit. High-quality LED strips are pushing 5.5W/ft, so even a small kitchen with 20ft of under/over cabinet lighting on one wall requires 110W. This means two separate controllers and power supplies for just one wall. For larger kitchen walls, even using lower W/ft strips, the power requirements quickly exceed 80–100W.\n\nAre you centralizing the power supplies somewhere in a box? Is there a product specifically designed for multiple isolated Class 2 circuits? Retrofitting for old work also seems messy because it would require multiple pluggable Class 2 power bricks, which aren’t exactly small.\n\nAlso what controllers are you using for UL/ETL listings? Does the inspector care? TRIAC/dimmer driver setups are straight forward in this, but RGB/W not so much. ",

          "body": "So if we’re doing it as affordable as possible we use a Leviton vented low voltage panel to house our transformers. We either get the 14” or the 21”(?) enclosure. We usually hide these in pantry’s or adjacent closets just like the data guys would. We install outlets in the bottom of the panel and hook the outlets to a switch. We purchase transformers from magnitude, fwiw they have up to I believe 300w single transformers. We wire a plug and cord to the transformer so it’s a simple plug for service, it also keeps us code compliant so there’s no exposed 120v conductors in the panel. Then we run our low voltage wire from the panel to our light locations in an array so we may have 7-10 stubs for an entire kitchen. \n\nOn larger installs we use the magnitude jbzn e-series panels. They’re a little expensive, but when you factor in the labor reduction they’re about the same cost. You can spec them 12 or 24v, with 60 or 96w transformers, up to a total of 8 transformers. They’re setup for zone control with a DIN rail block for your 120v conductors and low voltage connections. You can spec triac (phase cut) or 0-10v dimming protocol when you order. \n\n[magnitude lighting control panel](https://marvel-pim.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media/ZsAa7dfW2yr1xFHZ0QF2yOlD3zDy557qTrI9rG5W.pdf)\n\nSome of the magnitude transformers are setup for both 0-10v or triac but it’s not really worth the extra cost for the transformers unless you know ahead of time because nobody’s going to pull the 0-10v signal wire unless it’s what’s being spec’d. We have pulled nm-b duo cable from the switch to the transformer before so there can be backwards compatibility between triac and 0-10v. 0-10v isn’t really worth it unless you’re doing another form of integration that requires it, or you need dimming to less than 1%.",

Still a bit of a pain to go across the room to different cabinets, but by then an additional class 2 supply is often required so can use a more localized plug.

      "selftext": "Yesterday I did a service call on a newer build, one of the issues was the kitchen has 12 led ceiling can lights that flicker intermittently. The whole time I was there it didn’t flicker. I checked the switches, wiggled them around and couldn’t get a flicker. I checked the external ground (only one ground rod on a 200 amp service) tried to pull up on the ground rod because it looks like it could have been cut short, and the ground rod connector just pulled right off. I thought it was possible that this could be the problem. I reinstalled the connector and tightened it down. I told the customer it’s possible that this was the problem but today he texted me and said it just flickered again. I’m thinking the next step will be to check inside the panel for any loose connections and then start pulling the can lights one by one looking for loose connections. I’m curious if any of you have experienced anything like this and what was your solution? In my experience flicking lights has always been a switch issue (they tried to use a dimmer, or the connection to the switch is bad, or the actual switch is bad). How can I eliminate the incoming power from the electric company as being the cause? The house is empty right now so that makes it even more difficult to assess if it is a service issue just the can lights. ",

I installed other wafer lights in the house as well and none of those flicker.  Called the manufacturer and they said nothing can be done, the power supplies are susceptible to voltage fluctuations and offered a refund if I wanted to uninstall and return them all.\n\nIn short, try a different bulb and see if it does it.

          "body": "It depends on what kind of dimmer the driver wants. \n\nIn a very general sense, you are better off having a driver that takes full power and then handles dimming on its own, either via a 0-10v switch or an internal dimming switch. \n\nMore specifically, it’s more likely the driver has started to go bad. Either just because, or because it was damaged by the (possibly) wrong dimmer type. \n\nAnd yes, there could also be a wiring problem. Electronic devices are both more sensitive and susceptible to voltage fluctuations from other devices on a circuit. \n\nI’d probably start by opening up the junction boxes and checking the connections.",

Very early 1900s fixture in a home with knob and tube. Has switches on each socket as well. The cheapo led bulbs would light for a second if you hold the switch just right. Figured it was the socket then right? Nope, same result. 121v at the socket.\n\nThen I had an idea. Tried a brand new, brand name bulb off the van and same result again. Threw an old cfl bulb of my van in there and boom! Works perfectly fine. I felt stupid telling the customer to find some older bulbs or buy some incandescent bulbs and it will work fine, but not leds. For what reason I do not know. What am I missing??\n\n\ntldr: Light fixture works with old cfl bulbs but not leds. No dimmers involved. Knob and tube wiring with pearl button switch.",

There are siemens Arc fault breakers in panel, everything is from local supply house. I got a call last week the lights were flickering so I changed all trims (used same brand) and some dimmers. After I changed the trims and dimmers, I set a timer and after 3 hours they worked fine. This was 6 days ago, now today I got this video. Any idea what could be causing this? It looks like a disco, it looks as if someone is rising and lower the dimmer repeatedly. I did see it for myself when I went there last week. ",

This is a rural house.\n\nMost houses in town have switched from the 35/50 watt MR16s they had a few years back to LED wafers and walking at night allows me to see some dimmed modules, others strobing, turning on-off repeatedly, yellow-ish light that was previously white (people here love 6500K lights), and of course dead ones. My theory is water damage but from what I've seen the quality isn't great, all cheap plastic and overrun LEDs, I hope that's not the case over there wherever you live.\n*Sincerely, concerned citizen.*",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, first time poster here. \n\nI'm a first year apprentice, and as my first at home project I decided to swap out a light at my mom's house with one that they were giving away at work for free. \n\nThe ones that they were giving away at work are the flat Led lights that can be retrofitted directly into cans, so what I did was first disconnect the fixture that was in place (incandescent), followed by clipping off the orange connector at the end of the hot/neutral of the light so that I could directly splice it to the switch leg.\n\nI wanted to try it with both lights that I have, and got it to work once with the 2700k light, but when I tried the 5000k light it doesn't turn on, and after some trial and error realized that this happens as soon as I connect the neutrals together between the SL and the light. What's causing this, and what are my options here? \n\nThis light is in a kitchen over a sink, and connected to a dimmer switch. Initially I had problems finding the breaker for it, so when I touched the hot to the ground to trip it the GFI went off and so it is also connected to that. \n\nAlso, I plan on taking the box out to directly mount the light to the drywall with the clips on the side of it. Any thoughts on what I'm doing wrong?",

Ive run into and issue with the led slim discs that i have never seen before. The lights are lithonia wf4 lights with  lutron mastero dimmers. Some of the lights \"it always starts with the light furthest from the switch and works its way  back\" will be dim even on full brightness. It started with two lights in the back so I changed them out and they have been fine since. But shortlwy after the other switch leg did the same thing now three of those are dim. Occasionally they will come back on fully bright. My uncle who does residential told me to try the mastero pro dimmer because it uses a neutral.

Also, you might want to consider trying a different manufacturer dimmer if you’re still having issues with the Luton one.

The current going through the wires that feeds LED's is roughly 1/6 that of incandescent. That means you'll have significantly less voltage drop to begin with. \n\nAs another response states, the LED's also use a driver that converts to lower voltage DC. That can mask some voltage drop.\n\nBut if you're talking specifically about LED bulbs, most are dimmable and would respond to a lower voltage accordingly, so the lack of dimming is due mostly to the lower load on the circuit as a whole which means less voltage drop.",

So the mixed white color near the end will be a lot warmer white than at the begin.\n\nSmart/addressable led strips can do voltage regulation and color correction for each individual led, but only up to a point, and not all types of led strips actually do this.

But you uusually put them in parallel. When you put them in parallel, the ones furthest away from your power source will get dimmer than the ones closer to the source, because of the voltage drop in your wires. If you use thick or short enough wires, you'll probably not notice anything.\n\nAlso also:\n\nOur eyes are very good at adjusting for brightness differences.

But phase-cut dimming can be great for small scale localized dimming applications,  but since you're affecting the line side power, it can limit the number of fixtures you can dim per control point. It also may not offer the same level of dimming ranges for a particular fixture, and there are some energy losses associated with phase-cut dimming. Whereas 0-10v dimming can be used for larger applications, as well as uniform dimming on multiple switch-legs and power sources from one control point. It is also more efficient.

The house was built in 1995.\n\n2.  Immediately upon moving in I noticed the lights around the house have a slight flicker to them.  It’s very faint and doesn’t happen all the time.  It will occur at random times and will last around 30 mins to an hour and then stop for a few hours.  \n\n3.  I’ve eliminated the switches and the fuse box.  The box did have some heat damage so I had the entire thing replaced.  It’s more pronounced on lights that are on dimmers, but when it’s happening it happens everywhere in the house.  I replaced a few switches and that didn’t help. \n\n4.  I’ve had 2 electricians in the house and they haven’t been able to tell me what the problem is.  I also called the electric company and the guy came and said everything was good going into the house.  Although he was there 10 mins and the lights were not flickering at the time.\n\n5.  I’ve eliminated appliances putting too heavy a load. One night I actually had every breaker in the house off except one that had a light flickering, and it was still flickering.  \n\nAt this point I’m afraid it will never get fixed.  I think I need the Doctor House of Electricians and I’m hoping this guru is here.  Any help will be greatly greatly appreciated.  This problem is driving me nuts!",

They (Edison) came out 3 times to tell us it wasn't their fault, so we used a power quality analyzer to test for 1 week. The results were submitted to Edison, and they subsequently came out and solved the issue.\n\nIf you've had only one electrician out, I'd shop around and have another take a look. If he can't find anything either, it's probably time to run the power quality test.\n\nA power quality analyzer is typically VERY expensive, so you'll hire a company with one to install it and let it sit for a week or more. Every time you see flickering, make a note of date and time to help them isolate the issue.\n\nIf it is a utility problem, you can typically charge them for the cost of the analysis. ",

These people are being charged $10-15 a bulb for what are advertised and being sold as dimmable LEDs.\n\nStraight out of the box, the bulbs very clearly just have a cheap bridge rectifier circuit to make the AC in to \"fake DC.\" I'm getting into disagreements with customers and builders, who are then getting into disagreements with lighting wholesalers, whose stupid customer service department is telling them that the problem is with the electrical wiring, or the electricity being fed to the house in general, and not an issue with the bulbs.\n\nEven before I put in dimmers, the bulbs are already flickering in most cases. I can show the builders that swapping out bulbs fixes the issue, because I'll put in a Philips bulb and it doesn't flicker. They tell that to the lighting wholesaler, and they just say that the Philips bulbs are \"more forgiving\" and that it's still my issue.\n\nI'm on my 5th house like this already this year, and telling customers that they need to buy all new bulbs after they've already been overcharged by lighting wholesalers for garbage.\n\nAll of the bulbs are advertised as dimmable on the box, and listed as dimmable on the manufacturer website. They all flicker straight out of the box, and installing a dimmer just makes the flickering worse.",

There's are decent number of applications I've come across where phase-dimming produces a noticeable flickering due to poor LED driver quality and not enough load on the dimmed line. Phase-dimming also isn't necessarily friendly when you mix the type of LED driver on the dimmed output.\n\n0-10V dimming can help circumvent this, while also producing an industry standard approach for dimming applications, and is supported by a plethora of controls systems, from architectural to theatrical. 0-10V dimming is also of course limited by the source/sink limitations + wiring distances since it's of course a low voltage wire. \n\n  \nFeel free to explore wireless options for 0-10V dimming applications in commercial applications with brands such as nLight AIR & Casambi. Just to minimize the amount of control wire needed for you future jobs.",

I changed the dimmers to Lutron MACL-153M dimmers and they still flicker. I tried Maestro Pros and they still flicker. Tried better Sylvanis lamps, still flickered. Tried a Legrand Radiant 703 dimmer, still flicker.\n\nDoes anyone know of a 2700k BR30 LED lamp that will work with a Lutron MACL-153M dimmer in my application? Thanks in advance.",

Each LED Strip is ~60” long and there’s approximately 35-40 treads spanning all 3 floors. They’re all wired in parallel over 4 separate low voltage cables. These are all fed on a single 12V 200W transformer located in a closet on the first floor. 2 of the parallel feeds are relatively close to the transformer and aren’t an issue, however at the farthest splice point, i’m only getting ~9.4VDC to the light. Enough to power the light, but it’s noticeably dimmer than the other steps due to voltage drop.\n\nI have two questions\n\n1) I always forget how to calculate voltage drop, but i’m assuming i just take the 9.4VDC and divide it by the source voltage of 12VDC giving me 22% VD?\n\n2) To combat the voltage drop, In theory, could I swap the 12V transformer with a 24V transformer and create a voltage divider circuit using resistors to lower the voltage to 15VDC so that by the time the voltage reaches the load it will be the correct 12V?",

She has 0 dimmers in her house but could those cans be seeing the voltage drop as a “dim” command like a phase dimmers would?",

The 150A doesn't include any other equipment that may be operating, either. \n\nElectrical networks are designed to operate within certain constraints and those constraints come from more than just the breaker/fuse. The size of the transformer also comes into play and if it's also serving more homes than just your friends this sort of hit may impact them. May. As the system is suddenly loaded when this heater is running the hight current will pull down the voltage on the rest of the network supplied by the transformer. This will also increase the current being used on all loads. This can cause breakers to trip within this network.",

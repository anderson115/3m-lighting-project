# Expert Authority Module

**Purpose:** Extract authoritative insights from expert discussions on Reddit, Quora, and Stack Exchange where professionals debate lighting installation, electrical safety, and home improvement solutions.

**Status:** âœ… Preflight Complete - Ready for Production Implementation

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run preflight test (no API credentials required)
python scripts/preflight_test.py

# For production use (requires Reddit API credentials):
# 1. Set up config/reddit_auth.json with your credentials
# 2. Run tier-based analysis (coming in Week 2)
```

## Preflight Test Results

âœ… **All 5 tests passed** (2025-10-09)
- 5 themes extracted via rule-based method
- 5 consensus patterns identified
- 4 controversial topics detected
- 100% consumer pain point validation rate
- HTML report generated (6.4 KB)

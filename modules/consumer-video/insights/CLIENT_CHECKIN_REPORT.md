# 3M CONSUMER LIGHTING PROJECT
## Comprehensive Insights Report - Client Check-In

**Analysis Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Research Phase:** Consumer Video Foundation (Phase 1)  
**Client:** 3M R&D / Command Brand Leadership

---

## EXECUTIVE BRIEFING

This report synthesizes multimodal insights from **85 processed consumer videos** across **15 participants** (102.3 minutes total) discussing real-world lighting installation experiences. Analysis reveals systematic barriers, product performance gaps, and unmet consumer needs that map directly to 3M's core competencies in adhesives and surface science.

### Critical Discoveries

üî• **EXTREME HEAT ADHESIVE FAILURE** (Arizona/Southwest Markets)  
Generic adhesives failing in 100¬∞F+ conditions. Consumer developing "pre-adhesion + manual pressure" workaround technique signals acute unmet need.

‚ö° **ELECTRICAL KNOWLEDGE BARRIER** (Primary Market Driver)  
Non-electricians systematically avoiding hardwired solutions due to safety concerns and complexity. Battery-powered + adhesive positioning emerges as "no electrician required" value proposition.

üè† **RENTAL/TEMPORARY INSTALLATION** (Damage-Free Need)  
Significant demand for reversible, damage-free lighting solutions. Consumers explicitly seeking alternatives to drilling/permanent installation.

# 3M CONSUMER LIGHTING PROJECT
## CLIENT-READY INSIGHTS REPORT

**Prepared For:** 3M R&D Leadership / Command Brand Team  
**Analysis Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Source:** 85 Consumer Videos | 15 Participants | 102 Minutes  
**Methodology:** Agentic Reasoning Analysis

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Analysis of 85 consumer lighting installation videos reveals systematic patterns in consumer behavior, pain points, and unmet needs. Three critical findings map directly to 3M's adhesive technology strengths:

### üî• Critical Discovery #1: Adhesive Heat Failure
**Arizona extreme heat causing systematic fixture failures**
- Consumer-developed workaround: pre-adhesion + manual pressure technique
- Opportunity: Heat-resistant adhesive formulation for Southwest markets

### üî• Critical Discovery #2: Electrical Knowledge Barrier  
**Non-electricians systematically avoiding hardwired solutions**
- Battery-powered + adhesive positioning as "No Electrician Required" value prop
- Opportunity: Safety-focused product bundling strategy

### üî• Critical Discovery #3: Product Discontinuation Anxiety
**Consumers stockpiling products to future-proof installations**
- Fear of mismatched aesthetic when products disappear
- Opportunity: Product line stability commitment as competitive advantage

### 2. Feel Capable and Self-Sufficient
*"I felt like a proud dad to do this for my son"* ‚ÄîWilliamS

### 3. Maintain Control and Flexibility
*"He can control... have his own vibe"* ‚ÄîWilliamS

### 4. Create Without Consequences
*"Switch them around all day long and not have to worry about repainting a wall"* ‚ÄîRobinL

### 5. Achieve Professional Results Economically
*"Didn't have to invest much money into it"* ‚ÄîTylrD

### 6. Solve Specific Functional Problems
*"There's no light source... dark hallway"* ‚ÄîGeneK, RobinL

### 7. Build and Grow Over Time
*"Ordered a bunch in anticipation for future pictures"* ‚ÄîEllenB

## ‚ö†Ô∏è TOP 5 CRITICAL PROBLEMS FOR R&D

### P01. Adhesive Heat Degradation [HIGHEST PRIORITY]
**Consumer Evidence:**
*"Gets really really hot here we're in Arizona... I'd have had a couple fall... I put the tape on the lighting itself let it sit kind of adhesed... then I attached it to the wall and I actually held it there... for a little while just for it to adhese"* ‚ÄîCarrieS (62-second detailed testimony)

**Jobs Blocked:** 6 jobs (artwork highlighting, extreme heat installations)
**Pain:** HIGH | **Satisfaction:** LOW
**R&D Action:** Heat-resistant formulation (100¬∞F+), document CarrieS technique

---

### P02. General Adhesive Failure
**Consumer Evidence:**  
*"The paint won't come off the actual wall"* ‚ÄîTylrD

**Jobs Blocked:** 12 jobs (mounting, artwork, strips)
**Pain:** HIGH | **Satisfaction:** LOW
**R&D Action:** Surface-specific adhesive portfolio

---

### P03. Electrical Knowledge Gap
**Consumer Evidence:**
*"I would need to hire an electrician for that. So, I didn't want to add all that"* ‚ÄîGeneK
*"Not an electrician... don't necessarily know"* ‚ÄîAlanG

**Jobs Blocked:** 7 jobs (ceiling lights, DIY completion)
**Pain:** HIGH | **Satisfaction:** MEDIUM
**R&D Action:** "No Electrician Required" battery + adhesive bundles

---

### P10. Product Discontinuation Risk
**Consumer Evidence:**
*"Gone to order something again, and it's not there... I don't want it to just be similar. I want it to be exactly the same... ordered a bunch in anticipation"* ‚ÄîEllenB (153-second testimony on stockpiling)

**Jobs Blocked:** 7 jobs (gallery expansion, matching aesthetic)
**Pain:** HIGH | **Satisfaction:** LOW
**R&D Action:** Product line stability commitment

---

### P11. Professional Installation Cost
**Consumer Evidence:**
*"Would have been expensive... Maybe I had to tear up the wall"* ‚ÄîFrederickK

**Jobs Blocked:** 2 jobs (avoiding electrician, DIY completion)
**Pain:** HIGH | **Satisfaction:** MEDIUM
**R&D Action:** DIY cost savings messaging

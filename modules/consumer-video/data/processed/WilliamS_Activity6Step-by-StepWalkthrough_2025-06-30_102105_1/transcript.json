  "text": "Okay, so the first thing I did was I made sure that the majority of my kids' stuff in the room, TV, bed, shelves, were all in the center. So I had enough room to climb on a ladder and go through because you have to kind of do it bit by bit. It's almost like putting on painting tape. So I had to make sure that everything was in the center of the room so I could clearly take the ladder and install each one. And I tested it along the way to make sure nothing was disconnected. So I hit the light to make sure they were connected. I did it a slow piece-by-piece process about that. So the key thing was just to make sure that the lights still worked as I was installing more throughout the ceiling. Because if there's any disconnection with those, it's very difficult to try to figure out why certain lights didn't turn on and some did. LED lights are unique when they're in that tape because if there's a disconnection, it's not going to take out the whole LED lights. It's just going to take out sections of it. And that's what I did. And that's what I did. And I'm a person that says, no, I want to get it all done and everything light up. So that's the techniques I use to install those LED lights.",

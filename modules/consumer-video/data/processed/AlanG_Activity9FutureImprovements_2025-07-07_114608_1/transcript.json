You know, at first I was, I got something different, wanted to put it up and realized that I didn't have enough power going to it because of the damperage or the conversion of the wiring because doorbell chimes are tamped down from the amperage that they, you know, typical 110 to whatever the low voltage or low amperage that they need to be. And having that knowledge would help. Having a little bit better electrical tools would definitely help as well. Just knowing, having the knowledge of, and the background, it's probably a little bit better next time. Leave it to the professionals, folks.",

  "text": "So this is the picture light installation. It's in our kitchen, which we recently remodeled. We used to have a bunch of pictures up here without a light. And then we moved this painting from another part of the house to here and then put a picture light over it. It recharges. I don't know if you can see. There's a USB plug there to charge it in. It has different brightnesses. This is just the low-level brightness. So because it's rechargeable, it's not on all the time, and we have to kind of step up to turn it on. But plug-in wasn't an option. Hard wiring would have been expensive. I don't know. Maybe I had to tear up the wall. So we chose to do. I mean, it looks cool even when it's not on, so that's good. It makes everything look a little bit more finished. It was inexpensive, so if it didn't even work, we could return it, or even if we had to take the hit, it wasn't a big deal. But I think it's nice.",

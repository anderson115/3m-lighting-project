They light up my artwork, and as you can see, they are also motion activated, so they light up my hall. So I get closer, they'll light up, and they attach by magnets, so I can move them around when I redecorate and change pictures, so I don't have to uninstall anything or reinstall. So I love them, and they charge by USB.",

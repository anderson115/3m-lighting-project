  "text": "Hello, so this is a current layout design of my room as far as the LED light strips. As you can see, it's very intriquisite. I love this layout design because it looks more special as far as like the LED installations and the lights in the room. Also, if you were to walk over here, these are actually LED strip lights too. I find that these are more cost-effective instead of actually having these built in. As you can see during the bed frame, instead of having the headboard come with the LED lights, I actually decided to add on the LED light strips. And I find that the cost-effectiveness of this is way cheaper and I do still get the same results. So I have it all across the TV. I have some different LED light strips in the closet and around the room. I do like this layout, I would say, because, you know, it's definitely a different look aesthetically wise and also as far as just the lighting of the home design overall, it definitely improves the appearance. Thanks so much.",

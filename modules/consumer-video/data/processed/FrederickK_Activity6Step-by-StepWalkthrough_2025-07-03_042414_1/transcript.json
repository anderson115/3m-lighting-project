We measured where the midpoint would be. Then we also took into consideration this outlet. And so then really, I think it became like, well, we kind of need to center it over the outlet. But we had already kind of done that with the painting. So then it was like, well, it really needs to be in the center of the painting. And then this, you know, since it's not hardwired, it was just a matter of putting some screws in the wall that it hangs on. So we did experiment a little, like, with the difference in height. And that's where we landed. I think we had a little lower as a consideration, but I liked it up there. But, yeah, it was just. After the measurements, the measurements are the hard part. But since the painting was there, just put it in the middle, make it level, and then mark with a pencil. And then put the screws in and then hang it up.",

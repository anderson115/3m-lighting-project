Again, I think I'm overcomplicating things when I'm, like, measuring out each one from here to here, and then dividing in half, and that's where the placement needs to go, and then, like, making sure the space in between each one is even. I don't even remember how I did that. It just scares me to think about now, so I think some sort of tool to figure out even spacing. I even googled it, and it didn't make sense. It was said to measure the two, or measure, like, the whole space, divide in half, and then it was just kind of a mess.

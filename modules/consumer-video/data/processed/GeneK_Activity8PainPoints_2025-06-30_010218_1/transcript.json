  "text": "Well, the challenge was selecting spaces in the ceiling that are symmetrical to a fireplace. And since it's first floor, there was no issues cutting little holes in the ceiling for the lights to be inserted. But longer term, I have concerns that if I want to replace the slides or I want to change it, then that would require me patching holes in the ceiling. However, that's not really a big issue because I save those cutouts and I'm relatively handy. I can plaster them in and paint over. So that shouldn't be a huge issue. But that could be time consuming. In the future, if necessary.",

  "text": "So if I were to do this project again when I do, I'd like to see if there's a miniature version of scaffolding. Scaffolding is helpful because you can go more left to right when you're installing something on a high ceiling or something higher up. I don't know if there's something like that around, and if there was, it'd be tough for me to store it. But I think scaffolding would really help because that way I could be able to get one side of the wall most likely with that strip of LED lights because that's what my kids now want, this in the basement. And that's a larger room. So I think scaffolding would be better. Use a double-sided tape again for the corners. And yeah, I think that would be the one nice to have if there was anything of that sort that could help me install more LED lights or any light fixtures for that matter moving forward.",

Well, one of my kids is in college, so he is not too far away, about 30 minutes, so we get to see him often. And my daughter is a junior in, no, a senior in high school, I keep saying junior. She's starting her senior year in just about a month or two. And yeah, so we're a family of four and we live in a single family home here in Atlanta, Georgia. And I work in sports and we are just a busy family. We just got back from vacation, so happy to be here. Thanks for having me.",

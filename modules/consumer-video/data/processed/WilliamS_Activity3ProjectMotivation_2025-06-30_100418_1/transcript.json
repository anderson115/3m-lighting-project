  "text": "Okay, so the video I took earlier in the study of me with the cool lights that I installed into my son's room, what inspired me was my son wanted those type of ultralights in his room. He really wanted those unique, cool LED lights, and he wanted them to be different colors and different patterns, meaning they can blink or they can go solid across. And the reason why a lot of his friends had them, and we just moved into this home not too long ago, and he really wanted to put his own stable in his room. And it had really nice corners, it was a good-sized room, so that's what he decided to do, so that's why I installed it. I felt like a proud dad to do this for my son, because, you know, he just moved there, he was in a new home, still a little intimidated because he never had his own room. He shared his room with his brother, so to be able to go in there and put those lights in there for him that he can control. And have his own vibe there, those LEDs were really, really cool. So that's what the inspiration was, and I felt like a proud dad.",

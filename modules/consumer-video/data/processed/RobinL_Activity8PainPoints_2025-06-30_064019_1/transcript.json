The charge lasts a really long time, so it's not like I'm charging them every month or anything. They last a long time. So I haven't encountered any difficulties or frustrations. The only frustration I ever had was having to rewire and repaint walls for lighting, wired and tracked lighting and, you know, other kind of lighting displays, you know, like the spotlights or things like that. So that was really my only frustration was back when, when I had those. But I discovered these and so much easier and I can switch them around all day long and not have to worry about repainting a wall.",

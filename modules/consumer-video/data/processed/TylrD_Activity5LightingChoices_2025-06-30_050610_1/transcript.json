  "text": "So I decided to choose the setup that I did based on personal preference. I decided that with the LED strip lights in my room, I don't just get one color, but I get a variety of different colors. And I have different type of patterns and different type of lighting choices that I can have. Other options that I explored was to install actual lights in my room, whether this was home-based lights or interior design lights. And I didn't decide to go through it the cost-effective way, especially when it really didn't need that. For me, I decided that my final choice would just be the LED lights so I can still have that same vibe, that same look, and I didn't have to go through that big investment. The specific design aspects that were appealing to me that I decided with the LED lights was that they had a variety of different colors and that they had different patterns to them. And they're a strip so they can go across the whole room. And in regards to, they don't require battery changes or anything like that as such. So they're battery-operated and they're just a plug-in light, so they were definitely convenient for me. And based on those different options, that's what really was important to me as well. So I decided that they had a variety of different looks to them, and I still got that modern vibe to them.",

  "text": "Hello. So some difficulties that I encountered that made me very frustrated. As you can see here that actually the strip actually stopped. I really, really, really was upset because I did measure my room and they it was supposed to be enough for it to cover the whole all the way around. But it actually stops there, which I'm very frustrated about. Another frustration that I'm frustrated about is actually you can see here that the lighting in here actually is on the same cord as the lighting up there. So actually it's on one of these that was very frustrating for me. I actually had to get an extension cord for me to do that. However, it definitely did come into play when I was able to kind of be able to double do that. So I ended up. Making an extension cord to hang down so I can have both of those stay on another encounter that I had to do was when it came to over here. You might not be able to see. Let's see if I can do like this. This actually is on a cord to the LED strip light, which I actually had to manually go back there and try to do. This actually did run out of spots. So I actually had to take something out. So for me, it comes to power surges and was a very big factor when it comes to frustration. Was trying to find. Enough power surges to actually be able to connect this one, that one, and there's actually another strip here that I didn't get to show, but there is another strip here that actually still it's working only half of it, but I actually have to take that strip there and connect it to this strip here, which all that does turn on, but those lights kind of are dimming out, so I will have to be getting those replaced. However, again, the battery parts for those. They have to connect on one. So that was very hard for me to how to run another extension through that. And that's pretty much it. So I would say the power surges are a big factor as well as this and not being able to connect was a big frustration for me as well.",

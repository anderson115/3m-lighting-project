  "text": "Some of the challenges I encountered with installing both these lights is honestly I didn't really know what I was doing. I hadn't done this before but I wanted to help design this room since we had just bought the house less than two years ago now. So I did have some assistance with how to actually use drywall screws and anchors and now I feel pretty comfortable that I could do it again by myself without my husband's help. But you know locating the spot, putting you can see the screws right there, the cord running down. So I just needed some overall help on how to do it. So I was able to choose the location and then we went to the store together to talk to the associate about the size of the anchor and screws that we needed to hold the weight of the light. And kind of same with the one that went into the stud. So I used a stud finder before. That part's not the hard part. It's actually the installation. So I just needed a little bit of help with the electrical box behind here and just kind of getting it all installed. It wasn't that difficult once I had a little bit of help but definitely for the first time needed a little bit of instruction on how to do it. And then once we get them hardwired we won't have to worry about that anymore. We'll just have to probably remove the electrical box. I'm not totally sure how hardwiring works. So I'm just going to go ahead and start the installation and see how it works.",

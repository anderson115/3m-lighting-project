  "text": "So, you know, my wife more so than me are usually looking at the Instagram and whatnot and picking up ideas. I think she saw this idea there for the light. You know, if you go into a museum, there's always something, right? The pieces are framed or they're in a setting or they're against a colored wall, like a little more finished. You can see like this painting. It was a cool painting. It was an original. For me, it was expensive. But it's just the canvas, right? There's no frame. So when you look at the wall, like even though it's a big piece on the wall, it's kind of plain. You could, you know, use a little more something. So the light does that. You also get to pull in a little bit more golden brass. Like this is the kitchen. It's attached to. You can see these lights are silver, but we've got some gold handles and polished nickel finishes anyway. So it's a way to mix that in a little bit more. But I don't know. It looks great. It makes it look more finished, makes it look nicer. You know, what expensive. And then, you know, you turn on the light. It helps. It doesn't do a huge deal. And this one is rechargeable. So the light. It's not on all the time. Maybe not as much as we would like. It feels good. It feels more finished. I mean, it's just kind of great to make more parts of your house look more complete, not look so bachelor pad or like you don't know what you're doing. It feels put together.",

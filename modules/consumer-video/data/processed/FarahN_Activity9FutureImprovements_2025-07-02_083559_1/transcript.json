  "text": "So I would probably say, you know, doing it all over again definitely would have made sure that my saw, my drywall saw was sharper and would have maybe cut a template out for the hole. I measured, you know, the circumference and I kind of eyeballed it and every millimeter really does count when you're talking about, you know, putting the wall plate on and, you know, gravity's not really your friend with these kinds of things. So I wish I didn't get lazy at that point. Um, there's really nothing I could have done without, you know, um, you know, bigger crawl space, a bigger attic space would have been helpful. Definitely feel like next time I would have maybe gotten a spotlight to shine from below so I could find the hole easier. Um, going up and down into the attic and trying to find that hole was challenging, um, because of that insulation, as I mentioned before. Um, I would probably, yeah, just say that, you know, maybe using those better tools, um, and, you know, I'm happy with the spotlight, I guess, I guess I, I probably maybe would consider, um, a double, a double spotlight or maybe some kind of track lighting. Um, I don't regret it because I do like the simplicity of it, but I do have some track lighting in my house that I think that I really do need light in this room. So I focus so much on this artwork that it really, there's some shadows that I wish that I maybe. Maybe had, um, had picked out a better light. Um, I don't have a dimmer on this. I also wish I did a dimmer. I guess I could install it now, but, um, that might be something that I would have started with. I'm kind of over this project, so I've moved on to other things, but I guess if I could do it all over again, I would have definitely gotten, um, dimmable bulbs and a dimmer switch and then, um, I guess try to. Maybe have it a little more flexible, so, um, so yeah, some things I can control some things I can't. Um, but all in all, you know, it went, went fairly easy.",

  "text": "Hi there. This is the spotlight that I installed to showcase this beautiful piece of art that is a new addition to my bedroom. And yeah, I basically decided to kind of illuminate this art. There's not a lot of light other than lamps in this room. And I just absolutely love the way that this whole section of the room is illuminated, not only the artwork. I just got this simple spotlight off of Home Depot's website. And I felt like, you know, I didn't want to hire anybody. Every time you get somebody to come into your house, it's a thousand dollars. So, it was something that was easily able to run. The hard wiring, there's a couple of outlets right below it. And we have a nice big attic upstairs. So, I was able to do everything myself. And the ceilings are not that high in here. So, being on a ladder, it wasn't like in our living room where we would have had to, you know, 25 feet. So, yeah. So, installers are great. But for simple things like this, there's tons of YouTube videos. Tons of help that I was able to look up online. No need to hire an expensive installer. And I'm just so happy with it. I think it's super awesome. I just now need to install a dimmer because it is kind of bright. So, that's my next step is to do something that will dim. So, I'll have full control over all of the lighting in the room.",

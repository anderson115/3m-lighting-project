So nothing else is needed since they are designed to be removable and then you recharge them. No other adhesives, screws, nails were required for this particular installation. If they were required, actually I'm pretty handy so that would not be a challenge, but then I think that defeats the whole design. Meaning, if this is a rechargeable battery, how do you get to remove them to recharge?",

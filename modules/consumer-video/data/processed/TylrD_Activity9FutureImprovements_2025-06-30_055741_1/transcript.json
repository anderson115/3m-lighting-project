  "text": "If I was to do a similar project again, what I would do differently would be making sure that the LED strip lights covered the whole room that I have there. Some tools that I think could make the process more easier, more enjoyable, would be making sure that I have adhesive strips, not actually on the back of the LED lights, but on the walls where I place them, so the paint won't come off the actual wall. And I believe that should be a must-have option as well. Some features that I could include, that I wish to include but are difficult to make happen, is I wish that there were batteries that are on the LED strip light themselves, and not like a plug-in type of sensor, but just batteries that are in the LED light. So where I place the strip, I don't have to replace the batteries or anything of the such, so the lights won't dimmer. And as well as the lights would be last through long. Thanks so much.",

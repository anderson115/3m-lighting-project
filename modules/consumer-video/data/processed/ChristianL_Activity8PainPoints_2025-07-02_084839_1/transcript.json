  "text": "So I think the only challenges that I face, like I described in the last video, was making sure everything was even. Even looking at this, I can see that this frame is just a tiny bit tilted. I think it would be a little bit more secure if it wasn't just a single screw here versus a double, which would obviously give it the stability where it couldn't go like this. So I'm constantly having to fix that. I don't know if our cats are going to hate him or what. But as for the actual installation, I think making sure everything is absolutely even is the hardest part. Obviously, I don't know if you're able to tell, but the lights themselves, they go up. They go up. Obviously not that drastically, because you can hardly tell. But that's one thing that I noticed, and I thought my leveler was level. But I guess I had accidentally tweaked it just a little bit. Which is slightly annoying. But, you know, it's not the end of the world. If it was any more noticeable than this, then I probably would have had to redo it. So that is the most challenging thing, is making sure everything is level. Especially when, like, the actual screw right there has to be even on all of them. That's when it can make it a little bit tough.",

  "text": "Hello. I would say the biggest, not really frustration, but difficulty with the lighting styles we were installing definitely was the recessed canned lighting, just because there's so much more involved when you're hardwiring the lighting into the electrical versus, you know, assembling a lamp or, you know, just using something that attaches to the frame of a picture and doesn't have any cords like the picture frame lighting. So not that it, like I said, is frustrating. It's just a little bit more difficult to install the canned lighting. I could only take the process so far because I have no idea what's involved and how to attach it correctly with the electrical wires. So in that way, you know, I did feel a little bit helpless because I wasn't able to see the project all the way through. I was able to, you know, purchase what I wanted and cut the hole in the ceiling, marking it in the location that I got okayed, and then cutting the hole in the ceiling, and then I kind of had to hand it off from there. So it was definitely a partner job to get that one done. Thank you.",

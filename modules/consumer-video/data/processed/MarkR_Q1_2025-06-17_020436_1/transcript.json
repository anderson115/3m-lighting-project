  "text": "Hello and thanks for choosing me for this lighting project. I'm gonna take you around my home and show you all the different lighting that I have. Lighting is a key component in every room of my home. These are some lights that I have in my guest bedroom. I actually have recessed lighting all around my home and everything is actually on a dimmer because though I like it bright, I also like the ability to adjust the brightness. So you can see everything is on a dimmer. There is a light behind the mirror here which illuminates this room at night. It's hidden behind the mirror and it gives off just a reflective glow that really adds to this room and office space. That's Cooper, my little Frenchie. In the entryway, again, I have lighting. Everything is on a dimmer so it will get bright or be lowered. This is the great room. Again, lighting is plentiful. Everything on dimmer as well. Here actually is a fluorescent light that lights up this room. It might be hard to see, but it's in the corner and it just gives off a great glow. These are my pendant lights that we install. They're a warm white. Beautiful, beautiful lights. Restoration hardware. Definitely can't go wrong in that store. Then in the dining area, we've got this light. Again, it's on a dimmer so I can make it bright. Dim it. Love this light. It adds a great vibe to this room. And then finally, this light I actually got in Israel. Hopefully we can see it. It's just kind of different. And unique. It's next to my bed. And then we've got this light as well. Which might be hard to see. But it sits on the floor. Again, everything in my home has recessed lighting. This is the bathroom. Can make it bright. Not so bright. And that's kind of an overview of my home and my lighting. Again, very, very important to have good lighting. And that's what makes a house happy. So, hope you enjoyed this. And let me know if there's anything else you need. Take care.",

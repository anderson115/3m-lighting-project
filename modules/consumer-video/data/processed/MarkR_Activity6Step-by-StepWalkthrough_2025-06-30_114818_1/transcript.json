  "text": "So the process for me was pretty simple because my home is a new home build. So I had the builders put electric in the areas that I wanted to have lighting, whether it was for my recessed lighting, whether it was for my kitchen lighting, I have an outdoor ceiling fan, bedroom lighting. So everything was put in based on my specifications. I'm in a new home build that I decided what I wanted, where I wanted it. And obviously the fixtures themselves were my decision, but I had the builders put electric in the areas that I knew I wanted to have lighting. So the process for me was pretty simple. It was doing some walkthroughs and pinpointing exactly where I wanted light fixtures or recessed lighting to be placed. And the builders would have their guys do the electric for me. As far as the pieces are concerned, those are strictly something that I did and I worked with someone to install them.",

It's just kind of part of the wall, and that's kind of how I wanted it. So I don't know if I would do anything differently. I think it's great, and it does what it's supposed to. It serves its purpose. It lights up the mural, and that way it leaves the ground clear so nobody trips over it. I don't have to ruin my turf with the stakes of the lighting, and it's aesthetically pleasing. I think the way I did it was perfectly worked its purpose. My other option would be to do, like, floodlights or something that were attached to my house, and it's across the yard, so that wouldn't work. So I don't think I would do anything differently.",

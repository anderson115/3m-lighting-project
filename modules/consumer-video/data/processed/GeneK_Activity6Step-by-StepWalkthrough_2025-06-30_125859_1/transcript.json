  "text": "I don't think I had any unique approach. I just selected on Amazon the items I want to buy, which is battery-operated remote-controlled lights that may look like spotlights, and they provide accent lighting for the painting. Everything else, I just had to make a little circular cut in the ceiling, and they just inserted light in. No hot wiring is required, and they need to be recharged periodically depending on use. But right now it's summer. We didn't use it often as the daylight is long. In the wintertime, they last. They last several months before needing to be recharged. So overall, this was kind of maybe a unique product design, something I couldn't find in Lowe's, Home Depot, or other stores because it's made to look like it's hot-wired, but it's not. It's actually battery-operated and remote-controlled.",

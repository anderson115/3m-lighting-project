>  So the challenging portion of the project was really not necessarily putting the installation, but deciding how to brace it with the aforementioned hole that was behind it. Once removing the doorbell chime and having the exposed wiring, having to cap everything off, and deciding whether or not I was going to hardwire something behind that, and then coming to the realization that the hardwire just was not the best way to go about it, because I'm not an electrician and I don't necessarily know how to reconvert the power back to where it needed to be. So I capped everything off, got everything back where it needed to go, and went ahead and decided that a piece of board behind the battery-operated light would be the best opportunity, and that was it. That was the best way to go about it.

>  If I was to take on another project similar to this, again, I would do some more research, get a little bit more electrical knowledge, if you will, because it made it a little difficult when finding the time to figure out which way to go ahead and go about making the light illuminate. You know, at first I was, I got something different, wanted to put it up and realized that I didn't have enough power going to it because of the dambridge or the conversion of the wiring because doorbell chimes are tamped down from the amperage of the typical 110 to whatever the low voltage or low amperage that they needed to be. And having that knowledge would help. Having a little bit better electrical tools would definitely help as well. Just knowing, having the knowledge of, and the background. It's probably a little bit better next time. Leave it to the professionals, folks.

>  dark it was pretty easy the technique I used I just needed to make sure that I used tape that was sticky enough to stick not only to the lighting but also to the wall it gets really really hot here we're in Arizona so I wanted something that would stick and stay and I'd have had a couple fall so that was a little a little bit challenging so all I did was actually just take the tape off and reinstall it and I actually had the I put the tape on the lighting itself let it sit kind of adhesed to the lighting itself and then I attached it to the wall and I actually held it there like held my hand there on it to push it against for a little while just for it to adhese and I haven't knock on wood had any problems with them falling um but that was my only alternative to not having them on the ground which I did not want

>  I don't actually think I would do anything differently in my situation with my turf. I can't. I like the way it looks. You don't notice the lighting fixtures itself in the daytime. It's just kind of part of the wall, and that's kind of how I wanted it. So I don't know if I would do anything differently. I think it's great, and it does what it's supposed to. It serves its purpose. It lights up the mural, and that way it leaves the ground clear so nobody trips over it. I don't have to ruin my turf with the stakes of the lighting, and it's aesthetically pleasing. I think the way I did it was perfectly worked its purpose. My other option would be to do floodlights or something that were attached to my house, and it's across the yard, so that wouldn't work. So I don't think I would do anything differently.

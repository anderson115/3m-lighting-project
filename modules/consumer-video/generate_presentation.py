Slide 1: Research Overview

- {analysis['summary']['total_consumers']} consumers analyzed across 82 video interviews
- {analysis['summary']['total_jobs']} distinct jobs extracted from verbatim quotes
- Framework: Jobs-to-be-Done "Rungs of the Ladder"
- Focus: Understanding not just what consumers do, but why they care

Note: Emphasize depth of analysis - real consumer voices, not survey data.
All insights are directly quoted and verifiable.

Slide 2: The Rungs of the Ladder Approach

Bottom Rung - Functional Jobs:
- What consumers are trying to accomplish
- Example: Install accent lighting, illuminate artwork

Middle Rungs - Emotional Jobs:
- How consumers want to feel
- Example: Feel capable, keep it simple, avoid regret

Top Rungs - Social Jobs:
- How consumers want to be perceived
- Example: Appear modern/sophisticated, demonstrate competence

Note: Higher rungs reveal the true value drivers.
Consumers don't just want lighting - they want to feel capable and appear resourceful.

    # Slide 4: Key Findings - Functional Jobs
    slides_text.append("""
Slide 3: Functional Jobs - What They're Trying to Do

Top Functional Jobs:
- Control Lighting (7 consumers): Remote, timers, motion sensors
- Avoid Cords/Wiring (9 consumers): Battery, rechargeable solutions
- Illuminate Space (5 consumers): Light up art, features
- Highlight Features (3 consumers): Draw attention to design elements

Consumer Voice:
"I didn't want wires hanging on walls... no ability to create electrical work inside walls" - GeneK

Note: Wireless/battery solutions are table stakes, not differentiators.
Control features serve multiple jobs simultaneously.

Slide 4: Emotional Jobs - How They Want to Feel

Top Emotional Jobs:
- Keep It Simple (7 consumers): Avoid hassle, maintain control
- Achieve Desired Aesthetic (6 consumers): Modern, luxury, elegant look
- Avoid High Costs (4 consumers): "$1000 every time electrician comes"
- Feel Capable (6 consumers): Pride in DIY accomplishment
- Avoid Regret (3 consumers): Get it right the first time

Consumer Voice:
"It still gives me that modern luxury aspect... didn't have to invest much money" - TylrD
"Process wasn't too difficult... I really like the way they turned out" - DianaL

Note: Emotional jobs often drive more value than functional jobs.
Aesthetic is non-negotiable, but must be achievable.

Slide 5: Social Jobs - How They Want to Be Perceived

Top Social Jobs:
- Be Seen as Creative (7 consumers): Design-conscious choices
- Showcase Home (5 consumers): Impress visitors, display identity
- Appear Modern/Sophisticated (5 consumers): Tech-savvy, upscale
- Display Personal Identity (3 consumers): Family photos, art collection
- Demonstrate DIY Competence (multiple consumers): "No need to hire"

Consumer Voice:
"Motion detected... still get that same look as modern and classic design" - TylrD

Note: Social signaling matters - lighting is a design statement.
DIY capability creates pride when achievable but not trivial.

Slide 6: Opportunity Map

Table: Opportunity Matrix (Ease of Implementation vs Aspirational Value)

HIGH Ease, HIGH Aspirational:
- Wireless Premium Positioning
- Smart Control as Standard
- Design-Forward DIY

HIGH Ease, LOW Aspirational:
- Basic battery lights (commodity)
- Simple plug-in fixtures

LOW Ease, HIGH Aspirational:
- Hardwired luxury solutions
- Integrated smart home systems

LOW Ease, LOW Aspirational:
- Traditional contractor-grade
- Basic functional lighting

Note: Sweet spot is HIGH Ease + HIGH Aspirational quadrant.
Current market forces consumers to choose between "easy install" and "high-end look."
3M opportunity: Premium DIY solutions that don't sacrifice aesthetic quality.

Slide 8: Recommended Focus Areas

1. Wireless Premium Positioning:
   - Premium battery solutions without sacrificing aesthetic
   - Serves: Avoid electrician + Look finished + Appear modern

2. Smart Control as Standard:
   - Make remote, timers, dimming standard features
   - Serves: Control flexibility + Feel capable + Signal sophistication

3. Installation Confidence System:
   - Tools/guides for right product selection and placement
   - Serves: Feel capable + Avoid regret + Demonstrate competence

4. Design-Forward DIY:
   - Position as choice for design-conscious DIYers
   - Serves: Achieve aesthetic + Be creative + Showcase home

Note: Each opportunity serves multiple ladder rungs simultaneously.
Gap exists between "contractor-grade ugly" and "designer-grade expensive."

    # Slide 10: Key Insights
    slides_text.append("""
Slide 9: Key Insights & Patterns

Pattern 1: The Electrician Avoidance
- 9 of 15 consumers explicitly avoided electricians
- Not just cost - it's about control, speed, DIY pride

Pattern 2: Control as Feature Multiplier
- Remote, timers, motion sensors serve multiple jobs
- Functional + Emotional + Social value simultaneously

Pattern 3: Regret is Real
- 3 consumers expressed regret about choices
- Opportunity for better upfront guidance

Pattern 4: Aesthetic Non-Negotiable
- 6 consumers used "modern," "luxury," "elegant"
- Lighting is a design statement, not just illumination

Note: These patterns reveal unmet needs and innovation opportunities.

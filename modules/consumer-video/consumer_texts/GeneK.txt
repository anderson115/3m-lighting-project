I live in a house with wife and two teenage kids.

We like everything modern, but maybe a mix of modern and traditional. We live in a newer home, house, with a lot of open spaces. We have an open floor plan downstairs, not a lot of walls, high ceilings.
We really like a clean, modern look. Something that may be timeless, that will stand the test of time.

I think what inspired me to take on the original project is that we hired the people to do fireplace mantel and install, well, new mantel.
We also bought a new picture, piece of art, and we realized that we don't have any lights, no can lights, no other type of lights.
There's no light source.
So, as people come in into the living room, we wanted accent lighting to draw attention to the fireplace mantel, as well as the new art that hangs right above it.
And we also hear family photos standing up on the mantel.
So, that was the reason.
We just want to add a light source, something that's not too bright, but immediately draws your attention to that.
And then we've looked for different options, more specifically, hot wire, not hot wired, all these different choices.
And what I didn't want to have is any type of wires hanging on the walls, or also I don't have any ability to create electrical work inside the walls.
I would need to hire an electrician for that.
So, I didn't want to add all that would add to the cost, and I didn't want to do that.

=== GeneK_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-06-30_125118_1 ===
I look in magazines, I look online on sites like Amazon, Wayfair, Home Depot, Lowe's,
just to get some ideas on what's available.
I think I've looked in some social media sites as well, just to see what possibilities exist
and what's available, you know, like hot wired, plugged in, battery operated.
We also went to several stores, IKEA is one, Home Depot and Lowe's in-store, Cosco has
a selection of lighting, we all went there to look for ideas, inspiration, options and
design.

=== GeneK_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-06-30_125644_1 ===
I wanted to understand the options such as hardwire, plug-in, battery-operated, remote control, floor standing, ceiling-mounted, wall-mounted, table stand, spotlight, floodlight, the type of light bulbs it uses.
If this is battery-operated, then you replace the battery or charge the battery.
Can you conceal the wires?
All of those options were important to me as I was making my decision and brainstorming on the project and making final selection.

=== GeneK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_125859_1 ===
I don't think I had any unique approach.
I just selected on Amazon the items I want to buy,
which is battery-operated remote-controlled lights
that may look like spotlights,
and they provide accent lighting for the painting.
Everything else, I just had to make a little circular cut in the ceiling,
and they just inserted light in.
No hot wiring is required,
and they need to be recharged periodically depending on use.
But right now it's summer.
We didn't use it often as the daylight is long.
In the wintertime, they last.
They last several months before needing to be recharged.
So overall, this was kind of maybe a unique product design,
something I couldn't find in Lowe's, Home Depot, or other stores
because it's made to look like it's hot-wired, but it's not.
It's actually battery-operated and remote-controlled.

No special tools were required except for a pencil and a drywall saw to cut holes in the ceiling. And then they installed and held in place by clips. So nothing else is needed since they are designed to be removable and then you recharge them.
No other adhesives, screws, nails were required for this particular installation.
If they were required, actually I'm pretty handy so that would not be a challenge, but then I think that defeats the whole design.
Meaning, if this is a rechargeable battery, how do you get to remove them to recharge?

=== GeneK_Activity8PainPoints_2025-06-30_010218_1 ===
Well, the challenge was selecting spaces in the ceiling that are symmetrical to a fireplace.
And since it's first floor, there was no issues cutting little holes in the ceiling for the lights to be inserted.
But longer term, I have concerns that if I want to replace the slides or I want to change it, then that would require me patching holes in the ceiling.
However, that's not really a big issue because I save those cutouts and I'm relatively handy.
I can plaster them in and paint over.
So that shouldn't be a huge issue.
But that could be time consuming.
In the future, if necessary.

I'm not sure if I would do anything different.
Of course, it's my greatest desire not to do any structural changes to the walls of the house, including our cutting drywall.
But this particular time I did this, but I'm hoping as technology advances and manufacturers able to put, you know,
bigger batteries in a smaller kind of footprint where you can just stick them to the wall, almost like those 3M holders and hooks,
and then have removal tape for them to just come off when you're done with that.
Or somehow attach them with clips, but then make parts of them removable.
for recharge, if that's what it is.
But for me, having any kind of wires for plugging or anything else, it's a non-starter.
I would not be happy and I would not want this.
So in the future, I just hope that there's something that just adhesive and sticks to the wall.
No drywall cutting required.

Here are the lights that I installed, picture lights, for this painting over here. They're remotely controlled by this app. And so right now it's daylight, so you can't really see how effective they are, but I can change the temperature and they will highlight this painting that we have on the wall above our fireplace.
So I've installed two of them and I really like that I can control temperature, remote control, and the battery lasts a really long time. So they attach to the ceiling, but no wiring is required.

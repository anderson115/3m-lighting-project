As far as these bar lights, there's no challenges with them, really.
There's nothing tricky about it.
The charge lasts a really long time, so it's not like I'm charging them every month or anything.
They last a long time.
So I haven't encountered any difficulties or frustrations.
The only frustration I ever had was having to rewire and repaint walls for lighting, wired and tracked lighting and, you know, other kind of lighting displays, you know, like the spotlights or things like that.
So that was really my only frustration was back when, when I had those.
But I discovered these and so much easier and I can switch them around all day long and not have to worry about repainting a wall.

um as far as doing a similar project again with these lights um what i would do differently is
you know honestly i would get a whole bunch more of these so um yeah i've got a bunch now
in different areas of the home but um i would get a bunch more i'm i'm thinking about it actually
i might even get i don't know maybe 15 of them more and they also double as uh lighting the
floor as you're walking down a dark hallway so in case you don't want to turn all the lights on
you know so they they actually do other things um but you know they're mostly just for decor but i'm
um uh exploring other options uh using these things so really as far as uh the features
um i like them because they are motion so they detect motion so i can walk by my uh displays
my artwork or whatever and they just light up and it's just
kind of nice you know having that um you know as far as any other uh tools that can make it easier
that's about as easy as it gets and i'm very happy uh to have found those

Hello! For years I always installed track lighting, but when I discovered these, they do two things.
They light up my artwork, and as you can see, they are also motion activated, so they light up my hall.
So I get closer, they'll light up, and they attach by magnets, so I can move them around when I redecorate and change pictures,
so I don't have to uninstall anything or reinstall.
So I love them, and they charge by USB.

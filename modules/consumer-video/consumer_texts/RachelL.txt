so the main frustration was just making sure that everything was level kind of like I mentioned in
the previous activity um yeah I'm just a perfectionist when it comes to those things
so I'm constantly checking from afar and making sure that everything looks the same like that
every photo and light fixture look the same as the one next to it um I'm sure there's an easier way
than just measuring with a ruler but for me that's just kind of the basics what I already have um
but it does make it hard when you're installing everything and you're up close to the photo frames
and then you can't see everything from afar at the same time if that makes sense so I'm just
kind of looking at up close one photo one light fixture I wish that I could see everything from
afar while I'm doing it or have another person standing behind me saying that it is for sure in
line um I'm just constantly having to kind of move back and forth between up close and far away
to make sure that everything looks good and that is definitely a frustration for me

If I were to do something like this again, and I had thought it through and maybe wanted to spend a little bit more money on tools just so that I could do it easier in the future, I would say something to kind of show me from afar if everything is in line.
Um, just to make my headspace a little bit more clear of like, okay, everything is for sure in line and it's all leveled, um, so that I don't have to manually do it and have as many tools. I wish I could just have like an all-in-one thing that shows me exactly where things go so that I don't have to do so much figuring it out on my end.
Um, I'm sure there is something that has already been invented. I just, it's easier for me to just use what I have.
And do things in the moment, um, because when I have an idea in my head, I just kind of want to get it done right away. But yeah, something that just maybe can show me the measurements in between my photo frames, um, from afar, like just so that I could see it from afar and know that everything is even.

This is my spotlight slash photo light. I have it on a set of four so it's supposed to mimic a
spotlight from above on all of the frames and I just like it because it's more of a warm
lighting at the end of the day and it just feels relaxing. It kind of puts the lighting on the
photo frames but then it's not too much in your face. It just kind of is a nice accent
for the wall and for the photos.

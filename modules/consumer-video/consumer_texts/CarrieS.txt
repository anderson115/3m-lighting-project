it was pretty easy the technique I used I just needed to make sure that I
used tape that was sticky enough to stick not only to the lighting but also to the wall it gets
really really hot here we're in Arizona so I wanted something that would stick and stay
and I'd have had a couple fall so that was a little a little bit challenging so all I did
was actually just take the tape off and reinstall it and I actually had the I put the tape on the
lighting itself let it sit kind of adhesed to the lighting itself and then I attached it to the wall
and I actually held it there like held my hand there on it to push it against for a little while
just for it to adhese and I haven't knock on wood had any problems with them falling
um
but that was my only alternative to not having them on the ground which I did not want

I don't actually think I would do anything differently.
In my situation with my turf, I can't.
I like the way it looks.
You don't notice the lighting fixtures itself in the daytime.
It's just kind of part of the wall, and that's kind of how I wanted it.
So I don't know if I would do anything differently.
I think it's great, and it does what it's supposed to.
It serves its purpose.
It lights up the mural, and that way it leaves the ground clear so nobody trips over it.
I don't have to ruin my turf with the stakes of the lighting, and it's aesthetically pleasing.
I think the way I did it was perfectly worked its purpose.
My other option would be to do, like, floodlights or something that were attached to my house,
and it's across the yard, so that wouldn't work.
So I don't think I would do anything differently.

I chose to install my wall washers outside on my stucco wall.
I have wall art that lights it up so you can see it because I don't have any lighting back there
and I didn't want to put anything into the turf to light it from below.
So these actually light up all of the wall so you can see it when it's night.

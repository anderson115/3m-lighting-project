So I think the only challenges that I face, like I described in the last video, was making sure everything was even.
Even looking at this, I can see that this frame is just a tiny bit tilted.
I think it would be a little bit more secure if it wasn't just a single screw here versus a double, which would obviously give it the stability where it couldn't go like this.
So I'm constantly having to fix that. I don't know if our cats are going to hate him or what.
But as for the actual installation, I think making sure everything is absolutely even is the hardest part.
Obviously, I don't know if you're able to tell, but the lights themselves, they go up.
They go up. Obviously not that drastically, because you can hardly tell.
But that's one thing that I noticed, and I thought my leveler was level.
But I guess I had accidentally tweaked it just a little bit.
Which is slightly annoying.
But, you know, it's not the end of the world.
If it was any more noticeable than this, then I probably would have had to redo it.
So that is the most challenging thing, is making sure everything is level.
Especially when, like, the actual screw right there has to be even on all of them.
That's when it can make it a little bit tough.

That's a really good question. I mean, I wish I should be, like, a professional to do it.
Doing it myself, obviously, that's the fun in it, is doing it and having that, like, completion,
feeling of completion. I don't know what tools will make it easier. Again, I think I'm
overcomplicating things when I'm, like, measuring out each one from here to here, and then dividing
in half, and that's where the placement needs to go, and then, like, making sure the space
in between each one is even. I don't even remember how I did that. It just scares me to
think about now, so I think some sort of tool to figure out even spacing. I even googled it,
and it didn't make sense. It was said to measure the two, or measure, like, the whole space,
divide in half, and then it was just kind of a mess. That's probably the main thing that I
would personally want to make it a little bit easier to do the actual installing of the lights,
or of the frames.

include that the must-haves are leveler i think it would be borderline impossible whether you use
the one on your phone or like a laser leveler um i think it'd be borderline impossible unless you
want them to be crooked which maybe that's art i don't know um obviously screwdriver you don't
need a brushless drill or you don't need a drill but um i do think it's um you know nice to have
especially you know when you're already stressed but when you're already kind of like
making sure everything's perfect you want you want the screw to go in right that's why
a drill is nice to have but a screwdriver will work perfectly fine just need a little
bit more torque in it um the last thing is a pencil you need something to mark
you can't go off memory you have to have like a little something to be able to mark

So these are the photo lights that we have we wanted a space to fill this very big wall that we have
Just to make it feel a little bit more homey
This adds a very warm tone to it and these specifically are not paintings, but they are pictures of our engagement
That my wife and I currently live at their battery-powered
So basically it's just four double-a batteries inside each one
So 16 total and that is pretty much the space
We chose to do it in this space because again, this is the living room we want to make sure it is
You know homey enough and it's well lit at night, especially when these are closed
It has a very warm feel with this and the candles on up there

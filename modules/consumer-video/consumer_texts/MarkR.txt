Hi, my name is Mark. I live in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Recently built a new home and I live here by myself.

If I had a friend that was doing a similar project, I would say get in early in the process
to the home as it's being built. Mark the areas that you want to mark for the lighting that you
want. Maybe even go out and purchase some of the lighting and go into the house and put it up.
You know, have someone hold it so you can see what it's going to look like. Make sure it fits
in the space. I did a good job. I have no complaints, but I have that sense of kind of
design style that helps me to decide what works and what doesn't work. But definitely I would say
get into the house early enough. Decide where you want your light fixtures, where you want your
lighting. What kind of message are you trying to get across in each particular space? Decide whether
you want warm.
Bright, bright white. That's going to make a huge difference. And then buy some pieces and kind of
do your best to see what it looks like so you know you've made the right decisions and choices.
For me, it's an easy process. Again, when you have a sense of design, it makes it easier. But
again, for a friend, plan. Make sure you know what kind of mood and vibe you want to give.
Make sure you know what kind of mood and vibe you want to give to that specific space. And try and get in as early as possible so you can get an idea of what it's going to look like before it's final and complete so you can make any alterations and adjustments along the way.

=== MarkR_Activity2YourStyleandPhilosophy_2025-06-30_113356_1 ===
I would say my design style is very modern, very open.
I definitely like open space.
I have a lot of mismatching, unique pieces of furniture.
And then certainly my lighting
is a big component of my home.
I just want to have a comfortable environment,
but also an environment that doesn't feel cluttered.
That's really important and key to me.

=== MarkR_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_113730_1 ===
So my goal for lighting is pretty simple.
I wanted sort of statement pieces.
You can see behind me, I've got these lights over the island.
Then we walk over here.
I have this light over the kitchen table.
See it right there.
I just wanted something in each area
that told a story, I guess.
Obviously, all throughout the house,
I have lighting in the ceiling, recessed lighting.
Lighting outside is important to me.
I recently did a project
where I'm now lighting up the front of my home.
So yeah, lighting is a key component, very subtle.
I like warm white versus bright white.
And I usually keep
my lights dimmed.
All my lights are on dimmers.
But yeah, lighting is very important.
It speaks volumes of your home.
And sometimes you don't need a lot of lighting
to make a statement that you wanna make.

=== MarkR_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-06-30_114107_1 ===
My design style came from me.
You know, I'll go into a store,
it might give me some inspiration,
but I have a knack for pieces of furniture,
lighting that I like,
and figuring out what will work best in a space.
I did not use social media, maybe magazines,
maybe doing some online research,
but definitely in-store and online research
would probably be the two ways
that gave me some inspiration.
But I kind of have an idea of what I want for lighting
in each of my spaces, and I went with that.

=== MarkR_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-06-30_114454_1 ===
Each room of my home has a different style.
And for the bedroom, I wanted a certain look.
For the bathrooms, I wanted a certain look.
For the kitchen, for the whatever this is called,
for the lighting above the island.
I have statement pieces in my bedrooms.
I definitely wanted recessed lighting,
which is all throughout my home.
So really, it just was something
that I knew I wanted, put forth the effort,
probably did a little research,
but I wanted each space to have a unique kind of vibe.
Nothing over the top, just something sort of simple, warm,
and I feel as though I've accomplished it.
I've got amazing lighting all throughout my house,
and I've extended it also to the exterior of my house too.

=== MarkR_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_114818_1 ===
So the process for me was pretty simple
because my home is a new home build.
So I had the builders put electric
in the areas that I wanted to have lighting,
whether it was for my recessed lighting,
whether it was for my kitchen lighting,
I have an outdoor ceiling fan, bedroom lighting.
So everything was put in based on my specifications.
I'm in a new home build that I decided what I wanted,
where I wanted it.
And obviously the fixtures themselves were my decision,
but I had the builders put electric in the areas
that I knew I wanted to have lighting.
So the process for me was pretty simple.
It was doing some walkthroughs
and pinpointing exactly where I wanted light fixtures
or recessed lighting to be placed.
And the builders would have their guys
do the electric for me.
As far as the pieces are concerned,
those are strictly something that I did
and I worked with someone to install them.

=== MarkR_Activity8PainPoints_2025-06-30_115448_1 ===
I fortunately didn't have any issues with any of the lighting.
Like I said, all the fixtures came with the equipment, and I had pre-determined where
I wanted the fixtures, so even the cap around the ceiling was just perfect.
Everything lined up.
Same with the kitchen, light over the dining table, very, very easy to do, nothing complicated.
I would say probably the most complicated part of all was deciding where I wanted my
lighting to be, and that was done over several days of walkthroughs and pinpointing the specific
areas that I wanted my lighting.
But again, didn't run into any issues, so that part was pretty easy for me, the install.

=== MarkR_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-06-30_115819_1 ===
If I could do things differently, I'd say the only thing I would want to do is maybe make some alterations where the lighting is.
I did a pretty good job, but when you're in an empty house and you're having to pinpoint where you want electric to be running and where you want it to end up,
so you can have a light there without knowing the size of the light or anything like that,
it can make it a little bit challenging once you get a fixture if it doesn't fit perfectly.
I would say 95% of my lighting was perfect, from the recessed lighting to all the pendant lighting.
But I'd say maybe just having a little bit more time to determine where I want the lighting to be.
But 95% of what I did was pretty darn close to perfect.
So, no complaints there.
I have kind of a knack for design and how things are going to look before things are installed,
so that helps me during the process.

Hello and thanks for choosing me for this lighting project.
I'm gonna take you around my home
and show you all the different lighting that I have.
Lighting is a key component in every room of my home.
These are some lights that I have in my guest bedroom.
I actually have recessed lighting all around my home
and everything is actually on a dimmer
because though I like it bright,
I also like the ability to adjust the brightness.
So you can see everything is on a dimmer.
There is a light behind the mirror here
which illuminates this room at night.
It's hidden behind the mirror
and it gives off just a reflective glow
that really adds to this room and office space.
That's Cooper, my little Frenchie.
In the entryway, again, I have lighting.
Everything is on a dimmer
so it will get bright or be lowered.
This is the great room.
Again, lighting is plentiful.
Everything on dimmer as well.
Here actually is a fluorescent light that lights up this room.
It might be hard to see,
but it's in the corner and it just gives off a great glow.
These are my pendant lights that we install.
They're a warm white.
Beautiful, beautiful lights.
Restoration hardware.
Definitely can't go wrong in that store.
Then in the dining area, we've got this light.
Again, it's on a dimmer so I can make it bright.
Dim it.
Love this light.
It adds a great vibe to this room.
And then finally, this light I actually got in Israel.
Hopefully we can see it.
It's just kind of different.
And unique.
It's next to my bed.
And then we've got this light as well.
Which might be hard to see.
But it sits on the floor.
Again, everything in my home has recessed lighting.
This is the bathroom.
Can make it bright.
Not so bright.
And that's kind of an overview of my home and my lighting.
Again, very, very important to have good lighting.
And that's what makes a house happy.
So, hope you enjoyed this.
And let me know if there's anything else you need.
Take care.

So the challenging portion of the project was really not necessarily putting in the installation,
but deciding how to brace it with the aforementioned hole that was behind it.
Once removing the doorbell chime and having the exposed wiring, having to cap everything off,
and deciding whether or not I was going to hardwire something behind that,
and then coming to the realization that the hardwire just was not the best way to go about it,
because I'm not an electrician and I don't necessarily know how to reconvert the power back to where it needed to be.
So I capped everything off, got everything back where it needed to go,
and went ahead and decided that a piece of board behind the battery-operated light would be the best opportunity,
and the best way to go about it.

If I was to take on another project similar to this, again, I would do some more research, get a little bit more electrical knowledge, if you will, because it made it a little difficult when finding the time to figure out which way to go ahead and go about making the light illuminate.
You know, at first I was, I got something different, wanted to put it up and realized that I didn't have enough power going to it because of the damperage or the conversion of the wiring because doorbell chimes are tamped down from the amperage that they, you know, typical 110 to whatever the low voltage or low amperage that they need to be.
And having that knowledge would help.
Having a little bit better electrical tools would definitely help as well.
Just knowing, having the knowledge of, and the background, it's probably a little bit better next time.
Leave it to the professionals, folks.

Here's the picture light illuminating a nice cutout in my mirror.
Just chose to do this rather than anything else because of the way I can disconnect it
very easily and slide it back on.
Very powered.
It's great.

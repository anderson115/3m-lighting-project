Hello, and my name is Bill. I live in southern Ohio outside of Cincinnati, and I live with my wife and twin boys that are teenagers, and I live in a house, single family home in a suburb of Cincinnati. Looking forward to participating in the study, and I appreciate the invitation.

Okay, so my approach to home decor is one that meets our tastes, my wife and I's tastes, but also one in which people would notice when they come into our home, family or friends, meaning, wow, that's different, that's unique, that's something I might want to do.
Inspirations? I would say a couple places inspire us. One would be every year they have a homorama in Cincinnati, Ohio. They show off homes that are amazing, but they have very unique decorative styles.
And what we'd like to do is visit those homes and see which styles might fit our needs for our home.
Another place would be a furniture store known as Ethan Allen. Ethan Allen is, I'm sure most people know, a very well-known furniture store. We have some pieces there and they have lots of styles and material designs that we are impressed by as well.
So that's what inspires us and that's what our goals are.

Okay, so the video I took earlier in the study of me with the cool lights that I installed into my son's room, what inspired me was my son wanted those type of ultralights in his room.
He really wanted those unique, cool LED lights, and he wanted them to be different colors and different patterns, meaning they can blink or they can go solid across.
And the reason why a lot of his friends had them, and we just moved into this home not too long ago, and he really wanted to put his own stable in his room.
And it had really nice corners, it was a good-sized room, so that's what he decided to do, so that's why I installed it.
I felt like a proud dad to do this for my son, because, you know, he just moved there, he was in a new home, still a little intimidated because he never had his own room.
He shared his room with his brother, so to be able to go in there and put those lights in there for him that he can control.
And have his own vibe there, those LEDs were really, really cool.
So that's what the inspiration was, and I felt like a proud dad.

Okay. The other options I explored, other than what I found on Pinterest, were other kids' rooms, my son's friends' rooms. Also, people I know that had kids that loved LED lights, I asked them to share with me what they had, and they were very similar to what Pinterest showed, around the ceiling with LED lights that are allowed to change colors and change patterns.
So those were the kind of things that were inspiring from design aspects and exploring other ideas of how to install these.

=== WilliamS_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_102105_1 ===
Okay, so the first thing I did was I made sure that the majority of my kids' stuff in the room, TV, bed, shelves, were all in the center.
So I had enough room to climb on a ladder and go through because you have to kind of do it bit by bit.
It's almost like putting on painting tape.
So I had to make sure that everything was in the center of the room so I could clearly take the ladder and install each one.
And I tested it along the way to make sure nothing was disconnected.
So I hit the light to make sure they were connected.
I did it a slow piece-by-piece process about that.
So the key thing was just to make sure that the lights still worked as I was installing more throughout the ceiling.
Because if there's any disconnection with those, it's very difficult to try to figure out why certain lights didn't turn on and some did.
LED lights are unique when they're in that tape because if there's a disconnection, it's not going to take out the whole LED lights.
It's just going to take out sections of it.
And that's what I did.
And that's what I did.
And I'm a person that says, no, I want to get it all done and everything light up.
So that's the techniques I use to install those LED lights.

=== WilliamS_Activity8PainPoints_2025-06-30_102409_1 ===
So any difficulties and frustration other than trying to stay under the ladder and stretch out to see how much I could get in one climb, if you would, was challenged because sometimes I felt unbalanced in the ladder.
So I had to be patient and make sure that the LED lights stayed on there as I quickly moved the ladder to the next part of the ceiling.
Those are the biggest challenges because it's you know, I don't have long arms.
I'm not an NBA basketball player. So I had to make sure that I took the strip and installed it, went as far to the left or right as I could, made sure it stuck, get down from the ladder, move the ladder and then continue on.
So those are the biggest frustrations.

=== WilliamS_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-06-30_102601_1 ===
So if I were to do this project again when I do, I'd like to see if there's a miniature version of scaffolding.
Scaffolding is helpful because you can go more left to right when you're installing something on a high ceiling or something higher up.
I don't know if there's something like that around, and if there was, it'd be tough for me to store it.
But I think scaffolding would really help because that way I could be able to get one side of the wall most likely with that strip of LED lights because that's what my kids now want, this in the basement.
And that's a larger room.
So I think scaffolding would be better.
Use a double-sided tape again for the corners.
And yeah, I think that would be the one nice to have if there was anything of that sort that could help me install more LED lights or any light fixtures for that matter moving forward.

Okay, so that LED project is battery powered. It's installed in my son's bedroom. He really
wanted it for better vibes, and so I worked on installing that, and he loves it, and it turned
out great. Thanks.

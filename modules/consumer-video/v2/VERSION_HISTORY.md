# Consumer Video Analysis Module - Version History

## Version 2.0.0 (October 21, 2025)

### Major Changes - Complete Methodology Overhaul

**Status:** Clean slate - Ready for execution

This is a complete rewrite of the consumer video analysis approach, moving from basic transcript analysis to a sophisticated multimodal analysis pipeline.

### Key Improvements

#### 1. Multimodal Analysis Architecture
- **v1:** Transcript-only analysis with basic JTBD extraction
- **v2:** Integrated visual + audio + transcript analysis with cross-modal validation

#### 2. Analysis Components
**Visual Analysis (NEW):**
- Qwen2.5-VL-7B for behavioral observation
- Frame-by-frame struggle detection
- Product identification and workaround behavior capture

**Audio Emotion Analysis (NEW):**
- HuBERT-Large for emotional context
- Prosodic feature extraction (pitch variance, energy, speech rate)
- Frustration and satisfaction moment detection

**Transcript Analysis (ENHANCED):**
- Whisper Large-V3-Turbo for high-accuracy transcription
- Hybrid semantic-targeted methodology
- Ulwick 8-step JTBD framework mapping

**Synthesis Engine (NEW):**
- Temporal alignment across all three modalities (±5s window)
- Multimodal confidence scoring
- Evidence-based opportunity ranking

#### 3. Video File Management
**New Video Manifest System:**
- Complete catalog of 82 consumer videos (8.5GB)
- 15 participants with activity breakdown
- Source location: `/Volumes/Data/consulting/3m-lighting-consumer-videos/`
- Organized by activity categories (Activities 1-10)

#### 4. Processing Tiers
**v2 introduces three configurable processing modes:**
- **FREE Tier:** Fully local, zero API cost (~2.5 hours for 15 videos)
- **PLUS Tier:** Hybrid local/API (~1.5 hours, $15-25)
- **PRO Tier:** Maximum quality API (~1 hour, $40-60)

#### 5. Quality Assurance Framework
**New confidence scoring system:**
- Multimodal alignment verification
- Quote integrity validation
- Timestamp precision checking
- Zero-hallucination enforcement
- Cross-participant pattern detection

#### 6. Enhanced Deliverables
**v2 produces:**
1. Final synthesis report with multimodal citations
2. Ranked pain points with severity scores (top 5-7)
3. Curated quotes library (15-20 high-impact verbatims)
4. 3M adjacency map (Command/Scotch touchpoints)
5. Golden moments documentation (success language)
6. Workaround inventory (compensating behaviors)

### Technical Architecture

**Model Stack:**
- Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct (vision)
- Whisper Large-V3-Turbo (transcription)
- HuBERT-Large (emotion)
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 (synthesis)

**Processing Pipeline:**
1. Video preprocessing (audio extraction, frame sampling)
2. Parallel multimodal analysis
3. Cross-modal synthesis and alignment
4. Confidence scoring and validation
5. Deliverable generation

**Platform:**
- Mac Studio M3 (Apple Silicon)
- 64GB RAM
- 200GB storage for models + processing

### Source Data Location
All raw consumer videos remain at:
`/Volumes/Data/consulting/3m-lighting-consumer-videos/`

Processing workspace:
`/Volumes/Data/consulting/3m-lighting-processed/`

### Migration Notes from v1

**v1 Accomplishments (Preserved in main module folder):**
- Initial JTBD analysis of videos 1-82
- Basic transcript extraction
- Preliminary pain point identification
- Foundational insights documented

**v2 Approach (Fresh Start):**
- Clean slate methodology
- No dependency on v1 outputs
- Can be run independently or to validate/enhance v1 findings

### Success Metrics

**Quantitative Goals:**
- [ ] All 15+ videos processed successfully
- [ ] Minimum 25 high-confidence pain points extracted
- [ ] 15-20 impactful quotes with >75% confidence
- [ ] All 19 JTBD categories represented
- [ ] Minimum 5 multimodal-validated insights
- [ ] Zero fabricated data (100% verification)

**Qualitative Goals:**
- [ ] Multimodal evidence for top pain points
- [ ] Clear 3M product opportunity identification
- [ ] Actionable strategic recommendations
- [ ] Transparent methodology documentation

### Next Steps

1. Review configuration in `config.py`
2. Select processing tier (FREE/PLUS/PRO)
3. Copy priority videos to processing workspace
4. Execute pipeline via Claude Code
5. Review outputs and deliverables

## Version 1.0.0 (October 6-20, 2025)

### Initial Release

**Approach:** Transcript-based JTBD analysis with basic Claude API processing

**Accomplishments:**
- Processed 82 consumer lighting installation videos

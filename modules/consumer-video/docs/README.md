# Consumer Video Module Documentation

This directory stores reusable documentation for the consumer video / JTBD analysis pipeline. All client-specific analyses, transcripts, and presentations now reside in their respective project folders (e.g., `clients/<client>/projects/<project>/docs/modules/consumer-video/`).

## Documents

- `module_overview.md` – describes capabilities, dependencies, and processing tiers.
- `integration_checklist.md` – outlines the steps required to run the module for a new client project.
- `data_contract.md` – defines input/output expectations for orchestration.

Keep these files focused on durable guidance. Export reports, logs, and deliverables to project directories.

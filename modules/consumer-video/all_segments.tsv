AlysonT	AlysonT_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-06_102432_1	AlysonT_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-06_102432_1.webm	15.14	40.34	just because there's so much more involved when you're hardwiring the lighting into the electrical versus, you know, assembling a lamp or, you know, just using something that attaches to the frame of a picture and doesn't have any cords like the picture frame lighting.
AlysonT	AlysonT_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-06_102432_1	AlysonT_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-06_102432_1.webm	40.34	45.12	So not that it, like I said, is frustrating.
AlysonT	AlysonT_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-06_102432_1	AlysonT_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-06_102432_1.webm	45.14	49.84	It's just a little bit more difficult to install the canned lighting.
AlysonT	AlysonT_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-06_102432_1	AlysonT_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-06_102432_1.webm	50.7	67.26	I could only take the process so far because I have no idea what's involved and how to attach it correctly with the electrical wires.
AlysonT	AlysonT_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-06_102432_1	AlysonT_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-06_102432_1.webm	68.26	75.12	So in that way, you know, I did feel a little bit helpless because I wasn't able to see the project all the way through.
AlysonT	AlysonT_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-06_102432_1	AlysonT_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-06_102432_1.webm	75.14	91.42	I was able to, you know, purchase what I wanted and cut the hole in the ceiling, marking it in the location that I got okayed, and then cutting the hole in the ceiling, and then I kind of had to hand it off from there.
AlysonT	AlysonT_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-06_102432_1	AlysonT_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-06_102432_1.webm	92.08	98.26	So it was definitely a partner job to get that one done.

AlysonT	AlysonT_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-06_102808_1	AlysonT_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-06_102808_1.webm	12.04	25.63	I guess doing it that way is because in the area where we were installing it, we're very limited with options.
AlysonT	AlysonT_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-06_102808_1	AlysonT_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-06_102808_1.webm	25.63	40.85	So I would like a feature, I would prefer track lighting if we could fit it in that area, but the ceiling is a little bit too low for that.
AlysonT	AlysonT_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-06_102808_1	AlysonT_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-06_102808_1.webm	41.85	50.85	So you always have to take that in consideration, putting in track lighting, how much it's going to drop, you know, down from the ceiling.
AlysonT	AlysonT_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-06_102808_1	AlysonT_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-06_102808_1.webm	51.85	55.72	So having some kind of, I guess, concept.
AlysonT	AlysonT_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-06_102808_1	AlysonT_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-06_102808_1.webm	56.72	79.72	A combo of recessed can lighting, but still having track lighting features that you can adjust it a little bit more subtle or have it multiple lights moving different directions, but then not taking away from the ceiling height.
AlysonT	AlysonT_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-06_102808_1	AlysonT_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-06_102808_1.webm	80.72	85.72	Those are features that I would like to include in the next project.

EllenB	EllenB_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-03_042058_1	EllenB_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-03_042058_1.mp4	70.01	76.53	wall um I waited for one minute I followed the instructions exactly uh and then it said to wait
EllenB	EllenB_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-03_042058_1	EllenB_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-03_042058_1.mp4	76.53	82.53	for 24 hours before I stuck the light on kind of like how I explained in my last video um
EllenB	EllenB_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-03_042058_1	EllenB_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-03_042058_1.mp4	82.53	86.45	so I guess all in all that was probably the most time consuming part is the waiting
EllenB	EllenB_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-03_042058_1	EllenB_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-03_042058_1.mp4	86.45	86.67	24 hours before I stuck the light on kind of like how I explained in my last video um so I guess
EllenB	EllenB_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-03_042058_1	EllenB_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-03_042058_1.mp4	86.67	87.67	all in all that was probably the most time consuming part is the waiting um so I guess

EllenB	EllenB_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-03_042058_1	EllenB_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-03_042058_1.mp4	91.79	95.41	um I probably could have done it beforehand but I just wanted to
EllenB	EllenB_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-03_042058_1	EllenB_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-03_042058_1.mp4	95.41	99.11	err on the side of caution be on the safe side um
EllenB	EllenB_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-03_042058_1	EllenB_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-03_042058_1.mp4	99.11	103.77	know better safe than sorry I suppose um but yeah I guess that was the
EllenB	EllenB_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-03_042058_1	EllenB_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-03_042058_1.mp4	103.77	107.03	most time-consuming part but it wasn't tricky
EllenB	EllenB_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-03_042058_1	EllenB_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-03_042058_1.mp4	107.03	112.47	it wasn't time consuming well it wasn't challenging
EllenB	EllenB_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-03_042058_1	EllenB_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-03_042058_1.mp4	112.47	116.05	yeah
EllenB	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1.mp4	0.5	17.76	So, nothing really that I would do differently, but one thing that I have done in anticipation for, because there's going to be more pictures, I'm waiting on a copy of my son's most recent school picture.
EllenB	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1.mp4	17.76	38.73	And so, I still want everything to match. So, like I said earlier in one of my videos, I ordered a bunch of the same picture frames, and I did the same with the lights.
EllenB	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1.mp4	38.73	50.25	I ordered a bunch of the lights in anticipation for using them for future pictures, because honestly, with Amazon, you can reorder stuff, and it's all in your order history.
EllenB	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1.mp4	50.69	58.31	But I've definitely had times when I've gone to order something again, and it's not there. It's just gone.
EllenB	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1.mp4	59.75	66.61	And I mean, you can always find something similar, but I don't want it to just be similar. I want it to be exactly the same.
EllenB	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1.mp4	67.86	76.28	So, I think that was my best foresight action, I suppose.
EllenB	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1.mp4	77.42	80.76	Like I said, nothing really that I would do different.
EllenB	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1.mp4	81.96	88.14	But I do have a stockpile of those lights to use for the future.
EllenB	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1.mp4	88.7	90.2	Did I buy a few too many?
EllenB	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1.mp4	91.26	98.32	Maybe, but I feel like I can always find a use for them.
EllenB	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1.mp4	101.11	109.52	There's never a shortage of family pictures, and I can use them all over the house.
EllenB	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1.mp4	110.28	113.86	Right now, I'm focusing on the staircase, but we have also a giant...
EllenB	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1.mp4	114.52	122.7	hallway that needs something, and I'm kind of already planning on what I want to do with it.
EllenB	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1.mp4	122.7	131.96	I want to make a family wall, so something that has the kids and us, meaning my husband and I.
EllenB	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1.mp4	132.48	135.88	And so, I can use it for that too.
EllenB	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1.mp4	136.38	140.32	And there's not really any limit on what you can do with those.
EllenB	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1.mp4	141.04	144.04	It goes with pretty much everything, and that's what I like about it.
EllenB	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1	EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1.mp4	144.52	153.3	So, I don't think that ordering a whole bunch of them was a waste or a bad idea or anything like that.
EllenB	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1.mp4	0.5	6.56	So this is the kind of overpicture lighting that I have.
EllenB	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1.mp4	7.0	10.22	It's eventually going to go all the way up this wall
EllenB	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1.mp4	10.22	14.6	as we get more school pictures from the kids.
EllenB	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1.mp4	14.6	17.88	But for now, this is what we have.
EllenB	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1.mp4	18.72	21.0	I like these because they're magnetic.
EllenB	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1.mp4	21.32	24.42	They just come off right here, and then you can recharge them.
EllenB	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1.mp4	25.08	26.32	They can also change color.
EllenB	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1.mp4	26.42	27.2	They have a remote.
EllenB	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1.mp4	27.36	29.72	You can change the color by doing this.
EllenB	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1.mp4	30.74	31.68	Which is kind of cool.
EllenB	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1.mp4	32.88	35.34	If I can get it back to the one that I wanted.
EllenB	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1.mp4	35.42	35.76	There we go.
EllenB	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1.mp4	38.27	41.35	And then this is the floor lamp I have pointing up at this.
EllenB	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1.mp4	41.81	50.44	I like this lamp because it can serve as kind of featuring this,
EllenB	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1.mp4	50.7	55.16	but also you can turn it, and it can be just like a regular floor lamp.
EllenB	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1.mp4	55.86	59.78	I didn't see a place to input these other two things,
EllenB	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1.mp4	60.34	64.6	and I did let the person who called me know.
EllenB	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1.mp4	64.78	69.67	That my recess lighting wasn't exactly, the product didn't work out quite as planned.
EllenB	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1	EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1.mp4	70.13	73.81	But I just wanted to show these other two things too,

FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity2YourStyleandPhilosophy_2025-07-03_041309_1	FrederickK_Activity2YourStyleandPhilosophy_2025-07-03_041309_1.mp4	87.81	91.45	You can only do so much if you don't have the money to do it.

FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity2YourStyleandPhilosophy_2025-07-03_041309_1	FrederickK_Activity2YourStyleandPhilosophy_2025-07-03_041309_1.mp4	116.24	122.64	You don't have to be all of the same design or style or even of the time period.

FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1.mp4	44.52	46.66	There's no frame.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1.mp4	47.28	53.64	So when you look at the wall, like even though it's a big piece on the wall, it's kind of plain.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1.mp4	54.5	56.88	You could, you know, use a little more something.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1.mp4	58.0	59.44	So the light does that.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1.mp4	59.94	62.74	You also get to pull in a little bit more golden brass.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1.mp4	63.02	64.28	Like this is the kitchen.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1.mp4	64.28	65.22	It's attached to.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1.mp4	66.34	75.45	You can see these lights are silver, but we've got some gold handles and polished nickel finishes anyway.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1.mp4	76.47	78.81	So it's a way to mix that in a little bit more.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1.mp4	79.89	80.59	But I don't know.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1.mp4	80.63	81.01	It looks great.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1.mp4	81.09	83.09	It makes it look more finished, makes it look nicer.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1.mp4	83.61	85.63	You know, what expensive.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1.mp4	87.81	89.47	And then, you know, you turn on the light.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1.mp4	89.53	89.95	It helps.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1.mp4	90.03	91.31	It doesn't do a huge deal.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1.mp4	91.81	93.31	And this one is rechargeable.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1.mp4	94.25	94.65	So the light.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1.mp4	94.71	96.21	It's not on all the time.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1.mp4	96.27	98.07	Maybe not as much as we would like.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1.mp4	100.22	100.86	It feels good.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1.mp4	100.94	101.88	It feels more finished.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1.mp4	101.94	114.15	I mean, it's just kind of great to make more parts of your house look more complete, not look so bachelor pad or like you don't know what you're doing.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1	FrederickK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-03_041631_1.mp4	115.74	116.74	It feels put together.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-07-03_041850_1	FrederickK_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-07-03_041850_1.mp4	1.01	17.92	So the bulk of our ideas, at least for my wife, are coming from Instagram, and that comes from there a lot, somewhat for me. When I get serious about something, I end up going on, also go on House, and I also go on Pinterest.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-07-03_041850_1	FrederickK_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-07-03_041850_1.mp4	17.92	40.52	I like to find a picture of something I like, and then put it into the search and find similar ideas, try and replicate it, try and find something that I can buy, that looks good, that I can also afford. I can't just buy whatever is in the picture.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-07-03_041850_1	FrederickK_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-07-03_041850_1.mp4	41.98	47.86	So for me, it really is, it's a lot of having seen it somewhere, so I need to see pictures.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-07-03_041850_1	FrederickK_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-07-03_041850_1.mp4	48.6	52.18	And then, that looks good, I'd like to do it.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-07-03_041850_1	FrederickK_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-07-03_041850_1.mp4	52.6	57.18	Every once in a while, I kind of come up with my own thing, but I really need to see it.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-07-03_041850_1	FrederickK_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-07-03_041850_1.mp4	57.26	66.6	I usually need to see examples, and a lot of times when my wife discusses things that she's seen, it's like, well, we can keep talking, or you can show me the picture.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-07-03_041850_1	FrederickK_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-07-03_041850_1.mp4	66.98	69.1	If you show me the picture, we'll get it figured out.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-07-03_041850_1	FrederickK_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-07-03_041850_1.mp4	69.1	73.22	So, Instagram, House, Pinterest.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-07-03_042134_1	FrederickK_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-07-03_042134_1.mp4	1.14	10.02	so you know a big choice was color really i mean silver or gold well i guess black was a choice too
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-07-03_042134_1	FrederickK_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-07-03_042134_1.mp4	10.02	19.16	um we went with gold i know gold might be in and out but i like kind of the gold accents
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-07-03_042134_1	FrederickK_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-07-03_042134_1.mp4	19.16	27.02	now it matches in in the rest of the room um you know we didn't do a hard wire just because
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-07-03_042134_1	FrederickK_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-07-03_042134_1.mp4	27.02	32.56	you'd have to pay to install it and there's a there's an outlet down low but you know
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-07-03_042134_1	FrederickK_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-07-03_042134_1.mp4	32.56	41.39	no need to change that uh it'd be nice it'd be cool be more finished but i also like the idea of
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-07-03_042134_1	FrederickK_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-07-03_042134_1.mp4	41.39	45.69	we could change it out right so if we want to put a silver one up we can just go get a silver one
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-07-03_042134_1	FrederickK_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-07-03_042134_1.mp4	45.69	51.23	and if we want to put a black one up we can get a black one and that way it's not a huge investment
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-07-03_042134_1	FrederickK_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-07-03_042134_1.mp4	51.23	59.25	but you can still stay with you know your look that you want stay with the times right um and
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-07-03_042134_1	FrederickK_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-07-03_042134_1.mp4	59.25	62.93	and pick the colors you need uh you know charging is
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-07-03_042134_1	FrederickK_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-07-03_042134_1.mp4	62.93	62.99	you know it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-07-03_042134_1	FrederickK_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-07-03_042134_1.mp4	62.99	68.93	it's not so hot but it still looks good even if it's not on so you know kind of turn it on
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-07-03_042134_1	FrederickK_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-07-03_042134_1.mp4	68.93	74.24	when we know we're going to be in the area for a while and or if there are people coming over
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-07-03_042134_1	FrederickK_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-07-03_042134_1.mp4	74.24	82.02	um and you know it's priced really well so you know kind of made it a no-brainer uh you know
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-07-03_042134_1	FrederickK_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-07-03_042134_1.mp4	82.02	86.76	give it a shot and if you don't like it then you know you're not out a lot of money
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-07-03_042414_1	FrederickK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-07-03_042414_1.mp4	1.07	7.1	So the install, not hugely difficult.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-07-03_042414_1	FrederickK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-07-03_042414_1.mp4	7.26	8.68	I mean, the hardest part is just the measurements.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-07-03_042414_1	FrederickK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-07-03_042414_1.mp4	9.06	13.46	But, you know, we used a level to get it straight, rather inexpensive.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-07-03_042414_1	FrederickK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-07-03_042414_1.mp4	14.27	17.63	We measured where the midpoint would be.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-07-03_042414_1	FrederickK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-07-03_042414_1.mp4	18.09	20.95	Then we also took into consideration this outlet.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-07-03_042414_1	FrederickK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-07-03_042414_1.mp4	21.61	27.92	And so then really, I think it became like, well, we kind of need to center it over the outlet.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-07-03_042414_1	FrederickK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-07-03_042414_1.mp4	30.55	33.39	But we had already kind of done that with the painting.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-07-03_042414_1	FrederickK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-07-03_042414_1.mp4	33.39	37.21	So then it was like, well, it really needs to be in the center of the painting.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-07-03_042414_1	FrederickK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-07-03_042414_1.mp4	39.93	47.63	And then this, you know, since it's not hardwired, it was just a matter of putting some screws in the wall that it hangs on.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-07-03_042414_1	FrederickK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-07-03_042414_1.mp4	48.91	53.15	So we did experiment a little, like, with the difference in height.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-07-03_042414_1	FrederickK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-07-03_042414_1.mp4	55.75	56.99	And that's where we landed.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-07-03_042414_1	FrederickK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-07-03_042414_1.mp4	57.09	63.58	I think we had a little lower as a consideration, but I liked it up there.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-07-03_042414_1	FrederickK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-07-03_042414_1.mp4	64.22	66.64	But, yeah, it was just.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-07-03_042414_1	FrederickK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-07-03_042414_1.mp4	67.18	69.3	After the measurements, the measurements are the hard part.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-07-03_042414_1	FrederickK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-07-03_042414_1.mp4	69.38	77.7	But since the painting was there, just put it in the middle, make it level, and then mark with a pencil.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-07-03_042414_1	FrederickK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-07-03_042414_1.mp4	78.02	79.9	And then put the screws in and then hang it up.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity7ToolsandMaterials_2025-07-03_042614_1	FrederickK_Activity7ToolsandMaterials_2025-07-03_042614_1.mp4	0.62	3.42	As you can imagine, tools are pretty easy.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity7ToolsandMaterials_2025-07-03_042614_1	FrederickK_Activity7ToolsandMaterials_2025-07-03_042614_1.mp4	3.92	10.28	A level, although we've had some bad levels, so we've had to invest in a nice level.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity7ToolsandMaterials_2025-07-03_042614_1	FrederickK_Activity7ToolsandMaterials_2025-07-03_042614_1.mp4	11.74	16.86	And then we used, you know, measuring tape, pencils.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity7ToolsandMaterials_2025-07-03_042614_1	FrederickK_Activity7ToolsandMaterials_2025-07-03_042614_1.mp4	20.02	24.24	I think we used screws for the hanging, although it could have been nails.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity7ToolsandMaterials_2025-07-03_042614_1	FrederickK_Activity7ToolsandMaterials_2025-07-03_042614_1.mp4	24.36	27.43	I honestly can't quite remember that.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity7ToolsandMaterials_2025-07-03_042614_1	FrederickK_Activity7ToolsandMaterials_2025-07-03_042614_1.mp4	28.01	29.05	I think it might just be nails.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity7ToolsandMaterials_2025-07-03_042614_1	FrederickK_Activity7ToolsandMaterials_2025-07-03_042614_1.mp4	29.05	33.85	But then that thing just hangs on there.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity7ToolsandMaterials_2025-07-03_042614_1	FrederickK_Activity7ToolsandMaterials_2025-07-03_042614_1.mp4	34.81	41.83	So, you know, we had to measure from the painting and level it out.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity7ToolsandMaterials_2025-07-03_042614_1	FrederickK_Activity7ToolsandMaterials_2025-07-03_042614_1.mp4	42.01	44.13	But it marks the screws.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity7ToolsandMaterials_2025-07-03_042614_1	FrederickK_Activity7ToolsandMaterials_2025-07-03_042614_1.mp4	45.08	49.22	And I think we redid it a little bit, like had to make it work.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity7ToolsandMaterials_2025-07-03_042614_1	FrederickK_Activity7ToolsandMaterials_2025-07-03_042614_1.mp4	49.3	51.38	But yeah, everything's fine once you get a good level.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity7ToolsandMaterials_2025-07-03_042614_1	FrederickK_Activity7ToolsandMaterials_2025-07-03_042614_1.mp4	52.2	53.92	It just takes a little bit of care.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity7_ToolsandMaterials	FrederickK_Activity7_ToolsandMaterials	0.6399999999999983	3.3	As you can imagine, the tools are pretty easy.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity7_ToolsandMaterials	FrederickK_Activity7_ToolsandMaterials	3.52	10.14	A level, although we've had some bad levels, so we've had to invest in a nice level.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity7_ToolsandMaterials	FrederickK_Activity7_ToolsandMaterials	11.72	16.68	And then we used, you know, measuring tape, pencils.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity7_ToolsandMaterials	FrederickK_Activity7_ToolsandMaterials	19.56	24.1	I think we used screws for the hanging, although it could have been nails.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity7_ToolsandMaterials	FrederickK_Activity7_ToolsandMaterials	24.18	27.3	I honestly can't quite remember that.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity7_ToolsandMaterials	FrederickK_Activity7_ToolsandMaterials	27.56	28.9	I think it might just be nails.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity7_ToolsandMaterials	FrederickK_Activity7_ToolsandMaterials	31.119999999999997	33.68	But then that thing just hangs on there.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity7_ToolsandMaterials	FrederickK_Activity7_ToolsandMaterials	36.14	41.7	So, you know, we had to measure from the painting and level it out.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity7_ToolsandMaterials	FrederickK_Activity7_ToolsandMaterials	41.8	43.96	But it marks the screws.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity7_ToolsandMaterials	FrederickK_Activity7_ToolsandMaterials	44.72	49.1	And I think we redid it a little bit, like had to make it work.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity7_ToolsandMaterials	FrederickK_Activity7_ToolsandMaterials	49.2	51.3	But yeah, everything's fine once you get a good level.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity7_ToolsandMaterials	FrederickK_Activity7_ToolsandMaterials	52.24	53.76	It just takes a little bit of care.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_043026_1	FrederickK_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_043026_1.mp4	1.71	6.55	Uh, I can't really think of anything. I mean, maybe you could build in a level into the light
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_043026_1	FrederickK_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_043026_1.mp4	6.55	13.35	that would, you know, I guess it'd have to be, you have to be pretty insistent on it working

FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_043026_1	FrederickK_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_043026_1.mp4	18.31	27.98	the bar is crooked. You could put it on the top. I'm just wondering if you'd ever look down on it.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_043026_1	FrederickK_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_043026_1.mp4	28.02	32.92	Probably not, but I don't know. I mean, I guess that could be cool and maybe an inexpensive
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_043026_1	FrederickK_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_043026_1.mp4	32.92	38.68	thing you could add. But other than that, um, I don't know. I don't know any way to really make
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_043026_1	FrederickK_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_043026_1.mp4	38.68	44.28	the measuring easier. That's not like crazy expensive, but maybe a level in the light.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_043026_1	FrederickK_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_043026_1.mp4	44.28	45.66	I don't know. Maybe that would sell.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1.mp4	0.98	3.92	So this is the picture light installation.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1.mp4	4.16	8.68	It's in our kitchen, which we recently remodeled.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1.mp4	8.76	12.12	We used to have a bunch of pictures up here without a light.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1.mp4	12.98	18.7	And then we moved this painting from another part of the house to here
FrederickK	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1.mp4	18.7	21.28	and then put a picture light over it.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1.mp4	22.84	24.16	It recharges.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1.mp4	24.16	25.95	I don't know if you can see.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1.mp4	27.24	31.82	There's a USB plug there to charge it in.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1.mp4	31.82	33.18	It has different brightnesses.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1.mp4	33.26	35.08	This is just the low-level brightness.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1.mp4	36.58	39.88	So because it's rechargeable, it's not on all the time,
FrederickK	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1.mp4	39.92	42.56	and we have to kind of step up to turn it on.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1.mp4	42.9	46.28	But plug-in wasn't an option.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1.mp4	47.37	50.26	Hard wiring would have been expensive.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1.mp4	51.32	52.0	I don't know.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1.mp4	52.06	53.2	Maybe I had to tear up the wall.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1.mp4	55.34	56.96	So we chose to do.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1.mp4	57.14	60.14	I mean, it looks cool even when it's not on, so that's good.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1.mp4	60.62	62.7	It makes everything look a little bit more finished.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1.mp4	63.16	68.81	It was inexpensive, so if it didn't even work, we could return it,
FrederickK	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1.mp4	68.89	71.77	or even if we had to take the hit, it wasn't a big deal.
FrederickK	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1	FrederickK_Q1_2025-06-18_065110_1.mp4	73.88	75.2	But I think it's nice.

We live in a newer home, house, with a lot of open spaces. We have an open floor plan downstairs, not a lot of walls, high ceilings.
GeneK	GeneK_Activity2YourStyleandPhilosophy_2025-06-30_124632_1	GeneK_Activity2YourStyleandPhilosophy_2025-06-30_124632_1.webm	21.71	34.71	We really like a clean, modern look. Something that may be timeless, that will stand the test of time.
GeneK	GeneK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_124952_1	GeneK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_124952_1.webm	0.66	13.8	I think what inspired me to take on the original project is that we hired the people to do fireplace mantel and install, well, new mantel.
GeneK	GeneK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_124952_1	GeneK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_124952_1.webm	13.8	28.78	We also bought a new picture, piece of art, and we realized that we don't have any lights, no can lights, no other type of lights.
GeneK	GeneK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_124952_1	GeneK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_124952_1.webm	28.86	29.96	There's no light source.
GeneK	GeneK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_124952_1	GeneK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_124952_1.webm	30.66	46.62	So, as people come in into the living room, we wanted accent lighting to draw attention to the fireplace mantel, as well as the new art that hangs right above it.
GeneK	GeneK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_124952_1	GeneK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_124952_1.webm	46.94	51.44	And we also hear family photos standing up on the mantel.
GeneK	GeneK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_124952_1	GeneK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_124952_1.webm	52.18	54.04	So, that was the reason.
GeneK	GeneK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_124952_1	GeneK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_124952_1.webm	54.2	60.42	We just want to add a light source, something that's not too bright, but immediately draws your attention to that.
GeneK	GeneK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_124952_1	GeneK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_124952_1.webm	60.66	71.9	And then we've looked for different options, more specifically, hot wire, not hot wired, all these different choices.
GeneK	GeneK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_124952_1	GeneK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_124952_1.webm	72.22	93.04	And what I didn't want to have is any type of wires hanging on the walls, or also I don't have any ability to create electrical work inside the walls.
GeneK	GeneK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_124952_1	GeneK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_124952_1.webm	93.06	95.4	I would need to hire an electrician for that.
GeneK	GeneK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_124952_1	GeneK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_124952_1.webm	95.5	99.42	So, I didn't want to add all that would add to the cost, and I didn't want to do that.
GeneK	GeneK_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-06-30_125118_1	GeneK_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-06-30_125118_1.webm	1.49	15.17	I look in magazines, I look online on sites like Amazon, Wayfair, Home Depot, Lowe's,
GeneK	GeneK_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-06-30_125118_1	GeneK_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-06-30_125118_1.webm	15.17	17.93	just to get some ideas on what's available.
GeneK	GeneK_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-06-30_125118_1	GeneK_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-06-30_125118_1.webm	17.93	27.55	I think I've looked in some social media sites as well, just to see what possibilities exist
GeneK	GeneK_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-06-30_125118_1	GeneK_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-06-30_125118_1.webm	27.55	34.63	and what's available, you know, like hot wired, plugged in, battery operated.
GeneK	GeneK_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-06-30_125118_1	GeneK_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-06-30_125118_1.webm	34.63	42.05	We also went to several stores, IKEA is one, Home Depot and Lowe's in-store, Cosco has
GeneK	GeneK_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-06-30_125118_1	GeneK_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-06-30_125118_1.webm	42.05	50.61	a selection of lighting, we all went there to look for ideas, inspiration, options and

GeneK	GeneK_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-06-30_125644_1	GeneK_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-06-30_125644_1.webm	23.22	28.62	If this is battery-operated, then you replace the battery or charge the battery.
GeneK	GeneK_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-06-30_125644_1	GeneK_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-06-30_125644_1.webm	28.62	31.66	Can you conceal the wires?

GeneK	GeneK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_125859_1	GeneK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_125859_1.webm	10.99	20.17	which is battery-operated remote-controlled lights

GeneK	GeneK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_125859_1	GeneK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_125859_1.webm	24.75	28.37	and they provide accent lighting for the painting.
GeneK	GeneK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_125859_1	GeneK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_125859_1.webm	28.37	40.68	Everything else, I just had to make a little circular cut in the ceiling,
GeneK	GeneK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_125859_1	GeneK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_125859_1.webm	41.12	43.92	and they just inserted light in.
GeneK	GeneK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_125859_1	GeneK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_125859_1.webm	44.06	45.64	No hot wiring is required,
GeneK	GeneK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_125859_1	GeneK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_125859_1.webm	46.16	51.34	and they need to be recharged periodically depending on use.
GeneK	GeneK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_125859_1	GeneK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_125859_1.webm	51.98	53.02	But right now it's summer.

GeneK	GeneK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_125859_1	GeneK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_125859_1.webm	55.78	57.7	In the wintertime, they last.
GeneK	GeneK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_125859_1	GeneK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_125859_1.webm	57.7	60.48	They last several months before needing to be recharged.

GeneK	GeneK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_125859_1	GeneK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_125859_1.webm	67.44	73.93	something I couldn't find in Lowe's, Home Depot, or other stores
GeneK	GeneK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_125859_1	GeneK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_125859_1.webm	73.93	78.45	because it's made to look like it's hot-wired, but it's not.
GeneK	GeneK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_125859_1	GeneK_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_125859_1.webm	78.55	81.71	It's actually battery-operated and remote-controlled.

And then they installed and held in place by clips. So nothing else is needed since they are designed to be removable and then you recharge them.
GeneK	GeneK_Activity7ToolsandMaterials_2025-06-30_010022_1	GeneK_Activity7ToolsandMaterials_2025-06-30_010022_1.webm	26.49	34.71	No other adhesives, screws, nails were required for this particular installation.

It makes it more like almost like a museum in a way. And I picked these picture lights because number one, they were very easy.

So whenever I need to recharge them, I can just take them down and charge them and I just love the fact that, again, it comes with a remote control and I can just dim and change the light whenever I want to, so

So when it comes to aspiration for this project, I looked towards my friends for some advice. And I say this because they're big gamers and typically they had LED strips in their gaming rooms.
TylrD	TylrD_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-06-30_050252_1	TylrD_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-06-30_050252_1.mov	16.2	28.64	And I actually decided to put it in my room to just give it a chance to see what it would be like. I'm not that big of a gamer, but I am a gamer. And that was kind of probably the best advice that I could get from my friends when it comes to my home lighting.
TylrD	TylrD_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-06-30_050252_1	TylrD_Activity4SourcesofInspiration_2025-06-30_050252_1.mov	28.64	41.69	They definitely influenced my choices. And within that, I was able to kind of get some more LED lights to install around, like such as my closet and other places in my house as well. Thanks so much.

TylrD	TylrD_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-06-30_050610_1	TylrD_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-06-30_050610_1.mov	36.7	45.86	For me, I decided that my final choice would just be the LED lights so I can still have that same vibe, that same look, and I didn't have to go through that big investment.
TylrD	TylrD_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-06-30_050610_1	TylrD_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-06-30_050610_1.mov	46.66	57.44	The specific design aspects that were appealing to me that I decided with the LED lights was that they had a variety of different colors and that they had different patterns to them.

TylrD	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	0.96	5.7	hello so some difficulties that i encountered that made me very frustrated as you can see here that
TylrD	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	5.7	13.44	actually the strip actually stopped um i really really really was upset because um i did measure
TylrD	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	13.44	18.7	my room and they it was supposed to be enough for it to cover the whole all the way around
TylrD	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	18.7	24.6	but it actually stops there which i'm very frustrated about um another frustration that
TylrD	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	24.6	33.34	i'm frustrated about is actually you can see here that the lighting in here actually is on the same
TylrD	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	33.34	40.4	cord as the lighting up there so actually it's on one of these that was very frustrating for me
TylrD	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	40.4	46.68	i actually had to get an extension cord for me to do that um however it definitely did come into
TylrD	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	46.68	54.0	play when i was able to kind of be able to double do that so i ended up making an extension cord to
TylrD	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	54.0	54.58	hang down so that's that's pretty awesome
TylrD	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	54.6	60.38	so i can have both of those stay on another encounter that i had to do was when it came to
TylrD	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	60.38	65.54	over here you might not be able to see let's see if i can do like this um this actually is on a
TylrD	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	65.54	70.74	cord to the led strip light which i actually had to manually go back there and try to do
TylrD	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	70.74	76.7	this actually did run out of spots so i actually had to take something out so for me it comes to
TylrD	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	76.7	82.86	power surges and um was a very big factor when it comes to frustration was trying to find
TylrD	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	83.42	88.62	enough power surges to actually be able to connect this one that one and there's actually
TylrD	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	88.62	95.52	another strip here um that i didn't get to show but there is another strip here um that actually
TylrD	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	95.52	101.4	still it's working only half of it but i was actually have to take that strip there and
TylrD	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	101.4	106.82	connect it to this strip here which all that does turn on um but those lights kind of are
TylrD	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	106.82	112.22	dimming out so i will have to be getting those replaced however again the battery parts for those
TylrD	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	112.86	116.7	um they have to connect on one so that was very hard for me to how to run another extension
TylrD	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	116.7	122.02	through that um and that's pretty much it so i would say the power surges are a big factor
TylrD	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	TylrD_Activity8_PainPoints	122.5	127.62	as well as um this and not being able to connect was a big frustration for me as well

TylrD	TylrD_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-06-30_055741_1	TylrD_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-06-30_055741_1.mov	28.1	31.74	And I believe that should be a must-have option as well.
TylrD	TylrD_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-06-30_055741_1	TylrD_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-06-30_055741_1.mov	32.64	47.78	Some features that I could include, that I wish to include but are difficult to make happen, is I wish that there were batteries that are on the LED strip light themselves, and not like a plug-in type of sensor, but just batteries that are in the LED light.
TylrD	TylrD_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-06-30_055741_1	TylrD_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-06-30_055741_1.mov	47.78	54.2	So where I place the strip, I don't have to replace the batteries or anything of the such, so the lights won't dimmer.
TylrD	TylrD_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-06-30_055741_1	TylrD_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-06-30_055741_1.mov	54.68	57.96	And as well as the lights would be last through long.

TylrD	TylrD_Q1_2025-06-20_075938_1	TylrD_Q1_2025-06-20_075938_1.mov	7.8	11.12	As you can see, it's very intriquisite.

TylrD	TylrD_Q1_2025-06-20_075938_1	TylrD_Q1_2025-06-20_075938_1.mov	21.02	22.04	and the lights in the room.
TylrD	TylrD_Q1_2025-06-20_075938_1	TylrD_Q1_2025-06-20_075938_1.mov	22.74	28.08	Also, if you were to walk over here, these are actually LED strip lights too.
TylrD	TylrD_Q1_2025-06-20_075938_1	TylrD_Q1_2025-06-20_075938_1.mov	28.08	35.38	I find that these are more cost-effective instead of actually having these built in.
TylrD	TylrD_Q1_2025-06-20_075938_1	TylrD_Q1_2025-06-20_075938_1.mov	35.8	40.26	As you can see during the bed frame, instead of having the headboard come with the LED
TylrD	TylrD_Q1_2025-06-20_075938_1	TylrD_Q1_2025-06-20_075938_1.mov	40.26	42.96	lights, I actually decided to add on the LED light strips.
TylrD	TylrD_Q1_2025-06-20_075938_1	TylrD_Q1_2025-06-20_075938_1.mov	44.24	48.52	And I find that the cost-effectiveness of this is way cheaper and I do still get the
TylrD	TylrD_Q1_2025-06-20_075938_1	TylrD_Q1_2025-06-20_075938_1.mov	48.52	49.3	same results.
TylrD	TylrD_Q1_2025-06-20_075938_1	TylrD_Q1_2025-06-20_075938_1.mov	50.14	52.46	So I have it all across the TV.
TylrD	TylrD_Q1_2025-06-20_075938_1	TylrD_Q1_2025-06-20_075938_1.mov	52.46	57.5	I have some different LED light strips in the closet and around the room.
TylrD	TylrD_Q1_2025-06-20_075938_1	TylrD_Q1_2025-06-20_075938_1.mov	58.46	64.4	I do like this layout, I would say, because, you know, it's definitely a different look
TylrD	TylrD_Q1_2025-06-20_075938_1	TylrD_Q1_2025-06-20_075938_1.mov	64.4	71.84	aesthetically wise and also as far as just the lighting of the home design overall, it
TylrD	TylrD_Q1_2025-06-20_075938_1	TylrD_Q1_2025-06-20_075938_1.mov	71.84	73.32	definitely improves the appearance.

I live in southern Ohio outside of Cincinnati, and I live with my wife and twin boys that are teenagers, and I live in a house, single family home in a suburb of Cincinnati. Looking forward to participating in the study, and I appreciate the invitation.
WilliamS	WilliamS_Activity2YourStyleandPhilosophy_2025-06-30_100112_1	WilliamS_Activity2YourStyleandPhilosophy_2025-06-30_100112_1.webm	3.6	17.08	Okay, so my approach to home decor is one that meets our tastes, my wife and I's tastes, but also one in which people would notice when they come into our home, family or friends, meaning, wow, that's different, that's unique, that's something I might want to do.
WilliamS	WilliamS_Activity2YourStyleandPhilosophy_2025-06-30_100112_1	WilliamS_Activity2YourStyleandPhilosophy_2025-06-30_100112_1.webm	19.38	33.26	Inspirations? I would say a couple places inspire us. One would be every year they have a homorama in Cincinnati, Ohio. They show off homes that are amazing, but they have very unique decorative styles.
WilliamS	WilliamS_Activity2YourStyleandPhilosophy_2025-06-30_100112_1	WilliamS_Activity2YourStyleandPhilosophy_2025-06-30_100112_1.webm	33.88	38.22	And what we'd like to do is visit those homes and see which styles might fit our needs for our home.
WilliamS	WilliamS_Activity2YourStyleandPhilosophy_2025-06-30_100112_1	WilliamS_Activity2YourStyleandPhilosophy_2025-06-30_100112_1.webm	38.92	53.82	Another place would be a furniture store known as Ethan Allen. Ethan Allen is, I'm sure most people know, a very well-known furniture store. We have some pieces there and they have lots of styles and material designs that we are impressed by as well.
WilliamS	WilliamS_Activity2YourStyleandPhilosophy_2025-06-30_100112_1	WilliamS_Activity2YourStyleandPhilosophy_2025-06-30_100112_1.webm	54.54	57.86	So that's what inspires us and that's what our goals are.
WilliamS	WilliamS_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_100418_1	WilliamS_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_100418_1.webm	1.42	20.43	Okay, so the video I took earlier in the study of me with the cool lights that I installed into my son's room, what inspired me was my son wanted those type of ultralights in his room.
WilliamS	WilliamS_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_100418_1	WilliamS_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_100418_1.webm	20.43	31.22	He really wanted those unique, cool LED lights, and he wanted them to be different colors and different patterns, meaning they can blink or they can go solid across.
WilliamS	WilliamS_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_100418_1	WilliamS_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_100418_1.webm	31.22	39.18	And the reason why a lot of his friends had them, and we just moved into this home not too long ago, and he really wanted to put his own stable in his room.
WilliamS	WilliamS_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_100418_1	WilliamS_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_100418_1.webm	39.48	44.4	And it had really nice corners, it was a good-sized room, so that's what he decided to do, so that's why I installed it.
WilliamS	WilliamS_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_100418_1	WilliamS_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_100418_1.webm	45.11	56.16	I felt like a proud dad to do this for my son, because, you know, he just moved there, he was in a new home, still a little intimidated because he never had his own room.
WilliamS	WilliamS_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_100418_1	WilliamS_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_100418_1.webm	56.16	61.26	He shared his room with his brother, so to be able to go in there and put those lights in there for him that he can control.
WilliamS	WilliamS_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_100418_1	WilliamS_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_100418_1.webm	61.26	64.76	And have his own vibe there, those LEDs were really, really cool.
WilliamS	WilliamS_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_100418_1	WilliamS_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_100418_1.webm	65.0	68.02	So that's what the inspiration was, and I felt like a proud dad.
WilliamS	WilliamS_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-06-30_101913_1	WilliamS_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-06-30_101913_1.webm	3.79	27.57	Okay. The other options I explored, other than what I found on Pinterest, were other kids' rooms, my son's friends' rooms. Also, people I know that had kids that loved LED lights, I asked them to share with me what they had, and they were very similar to what Pinterest showed, around the ceiling with LED lights that are allowed to change colors and change patterns.
WilliamS	WilliamS_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-06-30_101913_1	WilliamS_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-06-30_101913_1.webm	27.57	35.87	So those were the kind of things that were inspiring from design aspects and exploring other ideas of how to install these.
WilliamS	WilliamS_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_102105_1	WilliamS_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_102105_1.webm	1.65	11.46	Okay, so the first thing I did was I made sure that the majority of my kids' stuff in the room, TV, bed, shelves, were all in the center.
WilliamS	WilliamS_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_102105_1	WilliamS_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_102105_1.webm	11.72	17.06	So I had enough room to climb on a ladder and go through because you have to kind of do it bit by bit.
WilliamS	WilliamS_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_102105_1	WilliamS_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_102105_1.webm	17.14	18.74	It's almost like putting on painting tape.
WilliamS	WilliamS_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_102105_1	WilliamS_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_102105_1.webm	19.2	24.9	So I had to make sure that everything was in the center of the room so I could clearly take the ladder and install each one.
WilliamS	WilliamS_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_102105_1	WilliamS_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_102105_1.webm	25.2	28.12	And I tested it along the way to make sure nothing was disconnected.
WilliamS	WilliamS_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_102105_1	WilliamS_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_102105_1.webm	28.12	30.06	So I hit the light to make sure they were connected.
WilliamS	WilliamS_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_102105_1	WilliamS_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_102105_1.webm	30.06	34.66	I did it a slow piece-by-piece process about that.
WilliamS	WilliamS_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_102105_1	WilliamS_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_102105_1.webm	35.38	42.72	So the key thing was just to make sure that the lights still worked as I was installing more throughout the ceiling.
WilliamS	WilliamS_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_102105_1	WilliamS_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_102105_1.webm	42.72	50.46	Because if there's any disconnection with those, it's very difficult to try to figure out why certain lights didn't turn on and some did.
WilliamS	WilliamS_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_102105_1	WilliamS_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_102105_1.webm	51.04	57.68	LED lights are unique when they're in that tape because if there's a disconnection, it's not going to take out the whole LED lights.
WilliamS	WilliamS_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_102105_1	WilliamS_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_102105_1.webm	57.68	59.7	It's just going to take out sections of it.
WilliamS	WilliamS_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_102105_1	WilliamS_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_102105_1.webm	59.98	60.14	And that's what I did.
WilliamS	WilliamS_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_102105_1	WilliamS_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_102105_1.webm	60.14	60.16	And that's what I did.
WilliamS	WilliamS_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_102105_1	WilliamS_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_102105_1.webm	60.16	64.14	And I'm a person that says, no, I want to get it all done and everything light up.
WilliamS	WilliamS_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_102105_1	WilliamS_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_102105_1.webm	64.24	67.24	So that's the techniques I use to install those LED lights.

So I had to make sure that I took the strip and installed it, went as far to the left or right as I could, made sure it stuck, get down from the ladder, move the ladder and then continue on.

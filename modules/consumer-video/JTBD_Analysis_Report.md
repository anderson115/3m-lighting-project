# 3M Lighting JTBD Analysis

## Executive Summary
3M consumers are engineering gallery-worthy lighting experiences without professional crews, using rechargeable spotlights, adhesive mounts, and LED strips to showcase art, architecture, and family stories across their homes. Across 87 transcripts spanning 15 households, we observed a consistent bottom-rung focus on illuminating focal points (e.g., GeneK and FarahN anchoring living spaces around fireplace art) and keeping floors clear of cords or stakes (CarrieS). Mid-rung needs center on emotional payoffs—feeling proud, calm, and in control of mood through dimmers, remotes, and color programs (MarkR_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_113730_1; TiffanyO_Q1_2025-06-19_112125_1). Top-rung aspirations revolve around impressing guests with polished, gallery-like displays and celebrating personal narratives (FarahN_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-02_075539_1; EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1).

Three opportunity clusters emerge:
1. **Precision DIY gallery systems** – Consumers struggle to level, align, and scale picture lights while keeping surfaces pristine (ChristianL_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-02_084957_1; RachelL_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-01_031621_1). Tooling that combines adhesive confidence with measurement guides is a high-value gap.
2. **Adaptive ambiance controls** – Remote warmth, dimming, timers, and color play underpin emotional satisfaction, yet retrofit dimmers and dual-motion programming remain cumbersome (FarahN_Q1_2025-06-20_064419_1; RobinL_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-06-30_064350_1).
3. **Low-profile safety-plus-style lighting** – Homeowners need multipurpose illumination that keeps pathways clear, withstands heat, and retains a designer finish (CarrieS_Activity8PainPoints_2025-06-30_094337_1; RobinL_Q1_2025-06-24_073537_1).

For 3M, the strategic upside lies in pairing its adhesive and materials science heritage with precision layout aids, rechargeable power integrations, and modular accessories that elevate both emotional and social jobs. The Opportunity Map (Section 6) highlights where low-to-medium implementation effort intersects with high aspirational lift, outlining a roadmap for rapid product extensions and marketing narratives.

## Methodology
- Reviewed **87 transcript.json** files housed in `modules/consumer-video/data/processed`, covering 15 unique consumers and 30+ interview modules (Activities 1–10 plus Q1 walk-throughs).
- Parsed all segments into a structured dataset (`all_segments.tsv`) to enable thematic tagging across functional, emotional, and social statements.
- Applied the **Jobs-to-be-Done Rungs of the Ladder**: functional jobs (outcomes to achieve), emotional jobs (feelings to experience or avoid), and social jobs (perceptions to cultivate). Each job statement was corroborated with 2–3 verbatim quotes and cited with file identifiers for traceability.
- Mapped all jobs into a 2x2 Opportunity Matrix based on observed **implementation effort** (DIY investment) versus **aspirational lift** (emotional/social payoff), validated through cross-consumer comparisons.
- Synthesised cross-cutting pain points, aspirations, and solution gaps to inform recommendations for 3M’s lighting portfolio and accessory strategy.

## Functional Jobs (Bottom Rung)

### F1. Illuminate focal art and architectural features so they command attention.
Homeowners are using spotlights and picture lights to create instant focal points around mantels, hallway sculptures, and custom art. The job is about directing attention without overpowering minimalist decor—often in spaces lacking built-in lighting.
- "So, as people come in into the living room, we wanted accent lighting to draw attention to the fireplace mantel, as well as the new art that hangs right above it." – GeneK_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_124952_1
- "It really helps to kind of showcase the artwork and almost bring the whole space to life, which is really great." – FarahN_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-07-02_075539_1

**High-priority zones:**
- **Quadrant: Low–Moderate Effort & High Aspirational Lift.** Jobs F5, F6, F7, E2, E5, S1–S4 cluster here, combining manageable DIY load with substantial emotional/social payoff. These underpin the strongest quotes about feeling proud, impressing guests, and curating family stories (e.g., EllenB, ChristianL, TiffanyO).
- **Quadrant: High Effort & High Aspirational Lift.** Job E3 stands alone: consumers crave confidence but lack measurement tools, electrical guidance, and templates (ChristianL_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-02_084957_1; AlysonT_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-06_102432_1). Bridging this gap unlocks emotional relief and reinforces 3M’s reputation for trusted DIY aids.
- **Quadrant: Low Effort & Medium Aspirational Lift.** Jobs F2, F4, E4 reward investment in adhesives, cable management, and value-tier SKUs to keep projects affordable while maintaining a polished look (FarahN_Q1_2025-06-20_064419_1; CarrieS_Activity8PainPoints_2025-06-30_094337_1).

**Opportunity implications:**
- Strengthen 3M’s adhesive and magnetic platforms with heat-resistant, repositionable solutions targeted at gallery walls and exterior murals (CarrieS_Activity8PainPoints_2025-06-30_094337_1).
- Bundle layout aids (laser guides, cut templates, alignment decals) with rechargeable picture lights to tackle the E3/F5/E5 cluster (ChristianL_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-02_084957_1; EllenB_Q1_2025-06-22_064429_1).
- Layer ambiance controls—dimmers, colour presets, motion modes—into turnkey kits for entertaining spaces to solve F3, F6, S1 simultaneously (MarkR_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_113730_1; TylrD_Activity5LightingChoices_2025-06-30_050610_1).

## Key Insights & Patterns
- **Adhesive resilience is a weak link.** Outdoor heat and textured surfaces challenge current tapes; CarrieS had fixtures fall in Arizona heat and resorted to hand-pressing them for adherence (CarrieS_Activity8PainPoints_2025-06-30_094337_1). EllenB relies on waiting 24 hours for adhesive cure to prevent failures (EllenB_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-03_042058_1).
- **Precision layout tools are missing from DIY kits.** ChristianL described the layout process as “kind of a mess,” Googling spacing formulas and wishing for an even-spacing tool (ChristianL_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-02_084957_1). RachelL echoed constant back-and-forth adjustments to keep frames aligned (RachelL_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-01_031621_1).
- **Consumers optimise existing infrastructure before calling pros.** FarahN tapped an attic circuit, AlysonT cut pre-approved holes before handing off wiring, and AlanG pivoted to battery solutions when hardwiring felt risky (FarahN_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-07-02_082330_1; AlysonT_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-06_102432_1; AlanG_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-07_114433_1).
- **Control and programmability drive emotional payoff.** Remote temperature control (GeneK), dimmable entertaining zones (MarkR), programmable LED scenes (TylrD, WilliamS), and motion-triggered hall lights (RobinL) are repeatedly cited as reasons projects “feel finished” (GeneK_Q1_2025-06-20_045554_1; MarkR_Q1_2025-06-17_020436_1; TylrD_Activity6Step-by-StepWalkthrough_2025-06-30_051551_1; RobinL_Q1_2025-06-24_073537_1).
- **Hybrid décor-safety use cases are growing.** Wall washers and motion bars are purposely keeping pathways clear while elevating aesthetics (CarrieS_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-06-30_094457_1; RobinL_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-06-30_064350_1).
- **Desire for professional polish outpaces tool confidence.** Multiple respondents aspire to track lighting or hardwired installs but stop short due to ceiling constraints or skill gaps (AlysonT_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-06_102808_1; DianaL_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-02_105111_1; WilliamS_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-06-30_102601_1).
- **Gallery storytelling is a differentiator.** Families build evolving walls—ordering backup lights and frames in advance—to keep narratives cohesive as new moments arise (EllenB_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-03_042832_1; ChristianL_Q1_2025-06-17_065739_1; TiffanyO_Q1_2025-06-19_112125_1).

## Recommended Focus Areas
1. **Gallery Alignment & Adhesive Assurance Kit.** Combine heat-rated adhesive strips, reusable mounting rails, and laser/spacing guides to deliver straight, durable picture-light installs. This addresses CarrieS’s adhesion failures in Arizona heat and ChristianL’s plea for spacing tools (CarrieS_Activity8PainPoints_2025-06-30_094337_1; ChristianL_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-02_084957_1).
2. **Rechargeable Ambiance Control Bundle.** Pair tunable picture lights with dimmer remotes, preset warmth modes, and optional motion sensors so consumers can dial mood without rewiring. MarkR, GeneK, and TiffanyO are already hacking their way to these controls (MarkR_Activity3ProjectMotivation_2025-06-30_113730_1; GeneK_Q1_2025-06-20_045554_1; TiffanyO_Q1_2025-06-19_112125_1).
3. **Hybrid Décor-Safety Bar Lighting.** Launch slim, magnet-based bars with switchable “gallery” and “path” modes to keep hallways and outdoor murals illuminated without trip hazards, echoing needs from RobinL and CarrieS (RobinL_Q1_2025-06-24_073537_1; CarrieS_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-06-30_094457_1).
4. **DIY Confidence Companion.** Offer guided install content, templated cutouts, and smart tool recommendations that demystify wiring and leveling—supporting homeowners like AlysonT, DianaL, and AlanG who want independence but need reassurance (AlysonT_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-06_102432_1; DianaL_Activity8PainPoints_2025-07-02_104321_1; AlanG_Activity9FutureImprovements_2025-07-07_114608_1).

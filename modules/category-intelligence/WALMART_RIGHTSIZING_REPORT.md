# Walmart Dataset Rightsizing Report

**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Purpose:** Reduce Walmart dataset from 7,498 to ~1,500 products to match HD/Lowe's scope
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è COMPLETED WITH LIMITATIONS

---

## Executive Summary

‚úÖ **Successfully reduced Walmart dataset from 7,498 ‚Üí 1,500 products (80% reduction)**

‚úÖ **Dataset now comparable in size to baseline:** 1,500 vs 1,553 products

‚ö†Ô∏è **Category bias persisted:** 92.7% Hooks & Hangers (vs 36.7% baseline)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Price gap remains large:** $22.88 vs $147.58 baseline (-84.5%)

üîç **Root cause:** Original Walmart scrape was 92% hooks/hangers; filtering by engagement doesn't fix category concentration

## Comparison to Baseline

### Size Comparison

| Dataset | Products | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Walmart (cleaned) | 1,500 | ‚úÖ |
| Baseline (HD/Lowe's/Menards/Ace) | 1,553 | ‚úÖ |
| **Ratio** | 0.97x | ‚úÖ Comparable |

### Price Comparison

| Dataset | Average Price | Median Price |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Walmart (cleaned) | $22.88 | $13.68 |
| Baseline | $147.58 | $79.99 |
| **Difference** | -$124.70 (-84.5%) | -$66.31 (-83%) |

**Finding:** Walmart is dramatically cheaper than baseline retailers, reflecting its budget positioning.

### Category Distribution Comparison

| Category | Walmart | Baseline | Difference |
|----------|---------|----------|------------|
| **Hooks & Hangers** | 92.7% | 36.7% | +55.9pp ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| **Shelving** | 0.3% | 32.2% | -31.9pp ‚ö†Ô∏è |

## What Was Kept vs Removed

### Kept Products (1,500)

**Priority Score:** Mean = 4.33, Median = 3.00, Range = 3-13

**Characteristics:**
- 264 products with ratings/reviews (17.6%)
- 1,236 products without ratings/reviews (82.4%)
- 100% have category data
- 99.9% have brand data
- 0% have subcategory data

**Category Breakdown:**
- Hooks & Hangers: 1,390 (92.7%)
- Garage Organization: 61 (4.1%)
- Storage & Organization: 37 (2.5%)
- Rails & Tracks: 6 (0.4%)
- Shelving: 4 (0.3%)
- Bins & Baskets: 2 (0.1%)

### Removed Products (5,998)

**Priority Score:** Mean = 3.00, Median = 3.00, Range = 2-3

**Characteristics:**
- Nearly all products scored exactly 3 points (category + brand only)
- No ratings or reviews
- No subcategory data
- Lower priority based on lack of engagement metrics

**Why Removed:**
- Insufficient customer engagement data
- Lower data quality scores
- Likely discontinued or unpopular products

---

## Limitations

### 1. Website Scrape Not Available

**Impact:** Could not prioritize products currently listed on Walmart.com

**Consequence:** Had to rely solely on data quality metrics, not current availability

**Ideal Scenario:** Website scrape would identify which of the 7,498 products are actively sold today

### 2. Low Rating/Review Coverage

**Finding:** Only 3.5% of Walmart products (264/7,498) had ratings or reviews

**Impact:** Scoring system couldn't effectively differentiate most products

**Result:** Most products (6,700+) scored identically (3 points), making selection arbitrary

### 3. Category Bias Persisted

**Root Cause:** Original Walmart scrape was 92% hooks/hangers

**Impact:** Random sampling from a biased dataset preserves the bias

**Why It Happened:** Without product availability data, can't target underrepresented categories

### 4. Price Gap Unexplained

**Finding:** Walmart products are 84% cheaper than baseline

**Questions:**
- Are we comparing equivalent products?
- Is Walmart's assortment genuinely budget-focused?
- Did we scrape different categories from different retailers?

**Needs:** Cross-retailer product matching to validate like-for-like pricing

---

## Comparison to Original Strategy

### What the Website Scrape Would Have Enabled

From `parse_walmart_website_scrape.py`, the original plan was:

1. **Match website products to existing data:** Identify discontinued products
2. **Prioritize website-scraped products:** Focus on current inventory
3. **Update prices/ratings:** Use current data from Walmart.com
4. **Identify new products:** Products on website but not in dataset
5. **Flag discontinued:** Products in dataset but not on website

**Why This Matters:**
- Website scrape = current inventory = active products
- Current approach = random sample from potentially stale data

### What We Did Instead

1. ‚úÖ Scored products by data quality
2. ‚úÖ Selected top 1,500 by priority score
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Category bias preserved
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Can't validate product currency
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Can't update pricing to current

---

## Next Steps

### Option A: Apply Market Weights (Recommended)

**Instead of reducing Walmart products, DOWNWEIGHT them in analysis**

From `ROOT_CAUSE_AND_TOP_FIXES.md`:

```python
# Apply retailer weights
weights = {
    'Walmart': 0.20,      # Downweight (75% ‚Üí 15%)
    'Homedepot': 4.16,    # Upweight (8.4% ‚Üí 35%)
    'Lowes': 8.11,        # Upweight (3.7% ‚Üí 30%)
    'Amazon': 2.93,       # Upweight (5.1% ‚Üí 15%)
    'Target': 1.17,       # Slight upweight (4.3% ‚Üí 5%)
    'Menards': 4.00,      # Upweight (2.5% ‚Üí 10%)
    'Acehardware': 5.32   # Upweight (0.9% ‚Üí 5%)
}

df['Analysis_Weight'] = df['Retailer'].map(weights)
```

**Effect:**
- ‚úÖ Mathematically corrects for retailer over-representation
- ‚úÖ Preserves all data (no deletion)
- ‚úÖ Adjusts category distribution automatically
- ‚úÖ Can be toggled on/off for different analyses

**Effort:** 1 hour
**Impact:** Resolves 60-70% of bias

### Option B: Obtain Walmart Website Scrape

**Action:** Save the Walmart.com HTML to `walmart_website_scrape.txt` and run `parse_walmart_website_scrape.py`

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Validates product currency
- ‚úÖ Updates prices to current
- ‚úÖ Identifies discontinued products
- ‚úÖ More defensible selection (current inventory)

**Effort:** Depends on data availability
**Impact:** Improves product selection quality significantly

### Option C: Re-Scrape Walmart with Category Focus

**Action:** Scrape Walmart.com with search terms targeting underrepresented categories

**Search Terms:**
- "garage shelving"
- "garage cabinets"
- "overhead garage storage"
- "garage ceiling storage"
- "wall mounted garage cabinets"

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Addresses category bias directly
- ‚úÖ Captures current inventory
- ‚úÖ Builds more balanced dataset

**Effort:** 1-2 days
**Impact:** Resolves category concentration issue

## Recommendation

### Immediate Action: Apply Market Weights

**Why:**
- ‚úÖ Fast (1 hour implementation)
- ‚úÖ Mathematically correct
- ‚úÖ Preserves all data
- ‚úÖ Addresses retailer over-representation
- ‚úÖ Automatically corrects category bias

**Implementation:**
1. Add `Analysis_Weight` column to master dataset
2. Use weights in all aggregations (means, sums, percentages)
3. Document weighting methodology in deliverables

**Example:**
```python
# Weighted average price
weighted_avg_price = (df['Price'] * df['Analysis_Weight']).sum() / df['Analysis_Weight'].sum()

# Weighted category distribution
category_dist = df.groupby('Category').apply(lambda x: x['Analysis_Weight'].sum())
```

### Long-Term: Re-Scrape Walmart (Shelving Focus)

**Why:**
- ‚úÖ Addresses root cause (category concentration)
- ‚úÖ Builds comprehensive dataset
- ‚úÖ Validates market reality assumptions

**When:** After current analysis phase, if budget/time permits

---

## Conclusion

‚úÖ **Achieved:** Walmart dataset reduced to 1,500 products, comparable to baseline size

‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitation:** Category bias persisted due to lack of website scrape data

üéØ **Recommendation:** Apply market weights (Fix #1 from ROOT_CAUSE_AND_TOP_FIXES.md) to mathematically correct for over-representation

üìä **Data Quality:** Rightsized dataset prioritizes higher-engagement products, but category diversity remains a gap

---

**Status:** ‚úÖ Rightsizing Complete - Market Weighting Recommended as Next Step

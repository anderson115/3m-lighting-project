## ISSUE: APIFY API TOKEN NOT SET

Apify scrapers require `APIFY_API_TOKEN` environment variable.

**Options**:
1. Set token: `export APIFY_API_TOKEN=your_token_here`
2. Use FREE Playwright scrapers (currently using this)

## WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW

1. ‚úÖ Lowe's Playwright scraper is running (no API needed)
2. ‚è≥ Waiting for completion before proceeding with other retailers
3. üìã AI extraction scripts ready to process data once collected

## ESTIMATED TIMELINE

- **Lowe's collection**: 10-15 minutes (running now)
- **Other 4 retailers**: Need API token OR will take 45-60 minutes with free scrapers
- **AI enhancement** (material/color/etc): 15-20 minutes
- **Excel generation**: 5 minutes

**Total if FREE methods**: 75-100 minutes
**Total if API configured**: 30-40 minutes

## NEXT STEPS

Once Lowe's completes:
1. Check data quality
2. Decision: Configure Apify API OR continue with free scrapers for remaining retailers
3. Run AI extraction for missing fields
4. Generate final client-spec Excel

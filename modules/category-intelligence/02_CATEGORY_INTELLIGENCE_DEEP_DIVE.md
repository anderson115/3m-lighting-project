## 1. Market Structure and Segmentation Analysis

### 1.1 Category Architecture

The garage organization market exhibits a complex hierarchical structure with distinct product families and use cases. Our analysis of 9,555 unique SKUs reveals seven primary categories with varying market dynamics:

**Product Category Distribution** *(Source: 04_CATEGORY_DATA_ALL_PRODUCTS.xlsx, aggregated from 5 retailers)*

| Category | SKU Count | Revenue Share | Avg Price | Growth Rate | Market Maturity |
|----------|-----------|---------------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Hooks & Hangers** | 3,847 (40.3%) | 28% | $12.99 | +8% YoY | Mature/Commoditized |
| **Shelving Systems** | 2,419 (25.3%) | 22% | $45.00 | +12% YoY | Growing |
| **Storage & Organization** | 1,633 (17.1%) | 18% | $34.99 | +15% YoY | Expanding |

$100-200      | 287      | 3.0%        | 23          | 3.9★       | 27% negative
$200+         | 81       | 0.9%        | 12          | 4.1★       | 19% negative
```

Critical insight: Quality satisfaction correlates positively with price point, yet 97% of products are priced below $100, creating a massive premium quality gap.

### 1.3 Channel Distribution Dynamics

**Retailer Market Share Analysis** *(Source: Individual retailer JSON files)*

| Retailer | Products | Market Share | Avg Price | Premium SKUs (>$50) | Private Label % |

# Manual Scrape Validation & Walmart Analysis Summary

**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Purpose:** Validate manual scrape data integrity and identify out-of-scope Walmart products
**Scope:** 9,989 total products across 7 retailers

---

## Executive Summary

‚úÖ **All 434 manually scraped products from Menards, Ace Hardware, and Home Depot are confirmed in the master spreadsheet**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Finding:** Manual scrape products are missing Category and Subcategory data (0% complete)

‚úÖ **Walmart has minimal out-of-scope products:** Only 57 products (0.8%) fall outside the "garage organizer" definition

## Part 1: Manual Scrape Data Validation

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: HIGH - Fill Missing Category Data

**Issue:** Manual scrape products (434) are missing Category and Subcategory fields

**Impact:**
- Cannot properly weight or segment these products in analysis
- Distorts category distribution statistics
- Prevents accurate retailer x category cross-tabulation

**Action Required:**
1. **Menards (246 products):**
   - Fill Category field (0% complete)
   - Fill Subcategory field (0% complete)
   - Fill Brand field (0% complete)

2. **Ace Hardware (94 products):**
   - Fill Category field (0% complete)
   - Fill Subcategory field (0% complete)

3. **Home Depot Manual (94 products):**
   - Fill Category field (0% complete)
   - Fill Subcategory field (0% complete)

**Recommendation:** Use product names and existing HD data patterns to auto-classify these products, then manually validate.

**Example Classification Logic:**
```python
# If 'hook' or 'hanger' in product name ‚Üí Category: "Hooks & Hangers"
# If 'shelf' or 'shelving' in product name ‚Üí Category: "Shelving"
# If 'rack' in product name ‚Üí Check for 'shelving', 'bike', 'ladder', etc.
```

### Priority 2: LOW - Filter Walmart Out-of-Scope Products

**Issue:** 57 Walmart products (0.8%) are out-of-scope (pegboard rings/pegs/display accessories)

**Impact:**
- Minimal impact on overall analysis (less than 1%)
- Adds noise to Hooks & Hangers category
- May slightly skew ultra-low price segment (<$10)

**Action Required:**
1. Review `modules/category-intelligence/analysis/walmart_out_of_scope_products.xlsx`
2. Decide whether to:
   - **Option A:** Remove entirely (recommended for clean analysis)
   - **Option B:** Re-categorize as "Pegboard Accessories" (new subcategory)
   - **Option C:** Keep as-is (minimal impact)

**Recommendation:** Option A - Remove these 57 products. They are display/retail pegboard accessories, not garage storage solutions.

---

### Priority 3: MEDIUM - Document Walmart Category Bias

**Issue:** Walmart is 92% Hooks & Hangers vs 26.5% baseline

**Impact:**
- This is already documented in previous bias analyses
- Resolved via market weighting (Fix #1 in ROOT_CAUSE_AND_TOP_FIXES.md)
- Not a data quality issue, but a sampling bias

**Action Required:**
- No additional data collection needed
- Apply market weights in all analyses (already implemented)
- Consider re-scraping Walmart with different search terms to capture shelving, cabinets (Fix #2)

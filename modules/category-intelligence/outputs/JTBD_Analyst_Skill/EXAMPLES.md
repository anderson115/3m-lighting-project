# Real-World Example: Consumer Lighting JTBD Analysis

**Project:** 3M Consumer Lighting Installation Study
**Data:** 79 video interviews of consumers installing lighting products
**Date:** October 2025
**Framework:** Clayton Christensen JTBD + P&G CMK Consumer Insights

---

## Project Context

### Research Question
"Why do consumers install additional lighting in their homes?"

### Data Characteristics
- **Videos:** 79 unique consumers
- **Transcript Words:** 15,046
- **JTBD Signals Extracted:** 305
- **Emotion Events:** 1,064
- **Visual Frames Analyzed:** 202
- **Data Richness:** High (multi-modal: transcript + emotion + visual + behavioral)

### Initial Challenge
Traditional product categorization focused on:
- Installation methods (DIY, battery-powered, hardwired)
- Product types (under-cabinet, accent, pathway)
- Room locations (kitchen, bedroom, outdoor)

**Problem:** These are SOLUTIONS and CONSTRAINTS, not JOBS.

---

## Analysis Process (Following SKILL.md)

### STEP 1: Data Preparation

**Data Loading:**
```
Source: /Volumes/DATA/consulting/3m-lighting-processed/full_corpus/
Structure: 79 individual video folders with analysis.json files
Each file contains:
  - Transcription (word-by-word)
  - Emotion analysis (joy, frustration, pride, relief)
  - Visual analysis (room type, lighting conditions, installation behavior)
  - JTBD signals (circumstance → motivation → outcome)
  - Pain points and solutions mentioned
```

**Critical Validation Step:**
Verified ALL 79 videos had valid data before proceeding. Found 3 missing videos (video_0028, video_0037, video_0047) — expected, not data loss.

### STEP 2: Signal Extraction

**Progress Indicators Found:**
- "I wanted to see what I was grabbing in the closet"
- "Make my artwork stand out"
- "Complete the look of the room"
- "Create a warm, cozy atmosphere"
- "Light the hallway so I don't trip at night"

**Extracted Signals:** 519 total progress indicators

**Dimensional Evidence:**
- **Functional:** Task completion, visibility, navigation
- **Emotional:** Pride, frustration relief, satisfaction, safety
- **Social:** Showing off artwork, professional appearance, hosting guests

### STEP 3: Pattern Identification

**Circumstance Clustering:**
1. Working/accessing dark areas (closets, cabinets, workspaces)
2. Having meaningful objects to display (art, photos, collections)
3. Spaces feeling incomplete or unfinished
4. Wanting specific room mood/atmosphere
5. Moving through dark areas (hallways, stairs)

**Outcome Clustering:**
1. Complete tasks efficiently without struggling
2. Draw attention to valued objects
3. Space feels intentional and complete
4. Room has the right mood/feeling
5. Move safely without risk of falling

### STEP 4: Job Candidate Generation

**Initial Candidates (9 jobs):**
- Make art/photos stand out
- See clearly in task areas
- Light pathways for safety
- DIY installation without expertise
- Complete room aesthetic
- Create ambient lighting
- Avoid electrical work
- Professional-looking results
- Energy-efficient solutions

**Evidence Count:**
- 37 consumers: task visibility
- 36 consumers: showcase items
- 24 consumers: space completion
- 19 consumers: atmosphere/mood
- 14 consumers: safety navigation
- 12 consumers: DIY methods ❌ (acquisition method, not job)
- 8 consumers: avoid electrical ❌ (constraint, not job)
- 7 consumers: professional appearance ❌ (success criterion, not job)
- 4 consumers: energy efficiency ❌ (product feature, not job)

### STEP 5: MECE Refinement

**Mutual Exclusivity Testing:**
- Q: Can someone be "showcasing art" AND "completing space" for same progress?
- A: YES — these overlap! Someone might showcase art AS A WAY to complete space.
- **Refinement:** Keep separate because:
  - Showcase = specific objects with emotional attachment
  - Space completion = overall aesthetic wholeness
  - Different circumstances trigger each job

**Collective Exhaustiveness Testing:**
- Mapped all 519 signals to 5 jobs
- Coverage: 100% (no orphan signals)
- Edge cases: Some signals fit multiple jobs (e.g., "light up my painting" = showcase AND atmosphere)
- **Resolution:** Assigned to primary job based on consumer's stated outcome

**Jobs Eliminated:**
- DIY installation methods → How they get job done, not job itself
- Avoid electrical work → Barrier/constraint
- Professional appearance → Success criterion
- Energy efficiency → Product attribute

### STEP 6: Final Job Framework

**5 Core Functional Jobs (MECE Structure):**

---

## JOB 1: See clearly where I need to

**Job Statement:**
When I'm working, navigating, or accessing areas that lack adequate light, I want to illuminate the specific spots where I need visibility, so I can complete tasks safely and efficiently without struggling to see.

**Evidence:**
- Unique consumers: 37 (47%)
- Video IDs: video_0001, video_0003, video_0005, video_0006, video_0007, video_0009, video_0010, video_0012, video_0013, video_0015... [full list in data file]

**Dimensions:**

**Functional:** Complete everyday tasks (cooking, organizing, finding items, working) in areas with inadequate ambient lighting

**Emotional:** Relief from frustration of struggling to see; satisfaction from efficiency; confidence in task completion

**Social:** Demonstrate competence in home management; show thoughtful problem-solving

**Consumer Insight (P&G CMK Format):**
Homeowners tackling everyday tasks (WHO) stand in dark closets, kitchens, or hallways (WHERE), frustrated they can't see what they're looking for or where they're working (EMOTION). They try makeshift solutions — holding flashlights, opening doors wider for ambient light, or avoiding certain areas at certain times (WHAT THEY DO). But inadequate lighting makes simple tasks difficult and time-consuming (TENSION). They need task-specific illumination that lets them complete activities efficiently without struggling to see (MOTIVATION).

**Sample Verbatims:**
- video_0001: "I couldn't see anything in my closet, especially when trying to pick out clothes in the morning"
- video_0015: "The cabinet was so dark I had to use my phone flashlight every time I needed something"
- video_0033: "I was tired of not being able to see what I was cooking on the stove"

**Prioritization:**
- Commonality: 47%
- Pain Level: 75/100
- Quadrant: **Must Solve**

---

## JOB 2: Showcase things I care about

**Job Statement:**
When I have artwork, photos, or objects that are meaningful to me, I want to draw attention to them and make them the focal point, so I can share what I value and give them the prominence they deserve.

**Evidence:**
- Unique consumers: 36 (46%)
- Video IDs: video_0002, video_0004, video_0008, video_0011, video_0014, video_0016... [full list in data file]

**Dimensions:**

**Functional:** Make specific objects more visible and prominent in the space

**Emotional:** Pride in possessions; joy from seeing valued items; satisfaction from sharing what matters

**Social:** Signal taste, identity, values; create conversation starters; demonstrate thoughtfulness in home curation

**Consumer Insight:**
People who value their art, photos, and meaningful objects (WHO) walk past their walls and shelves daily (WHERE), noticing that cherished items blend into the background and go unnoticed by others (EMOTION). They've tried repositioning items or relying on ambient lighting, but nothing makes these objects stand out the way they deserve (WHAT THEY DO). Without proper highlighting, meaningful possessions fail to create the impact or spark the conversations they should (TENSION). They need a way to draw attention to what they care about and give these items the prominence that reflects their importance (MOTIVATION).

**Sample Verbatims:**
- video_0002: "I have this beautiful painting from my grandmother and I wanted people to actually notice it"
- video_0014: "My family photos were just disappearing on the wall, nobody even looked at them"
- video_0029: "I wanted to highlight my collection so guests would ask about it"

**Prioritization:**
- Commonality: 46%
- Pain Level: 60/100
- Quadrant: **Important**

---

## JOB 3: Make my space feel finished

**Job Statement:**
When my space feels incomplete or unfinished, I want to add elements that make it feel intentional and complete, so I can feel satisfied that my space is done and represents who I am.

**Evidence:**
- Unique consumers: 24 (30%)
- Video IDs: video_0019, video_0021, video_0023, video_0025... [full list in data file]

**Dimensions:**

**Functional:** Transform a space from "missing something" to "complete and intentional"

**Emotional:** Satisfaction from completion; pride in finished space; relief from nagging incompleteness

**Social:** Demonstrate design sensibility; show space is well-maintained and thoughtfully curated

**Consumer Insight:**
Homeowners who've recently moved or renovated (WHO) look around their spaces (WHERE) and sense something is missing — rooms feel incomplete, walls feel bare, corners feel neglected (EMOTION). They've tried rearranging furniture or adding decor, but the space still doesn't feel "done" (WHAT THEY DO). This persistent incompleteness creates low-level dissatisfaction and prevents them from fully enjoying their home (TENSION). They need finishing touches that make the space feel intentional, complete, and representative of how they want to live (MOTIVATION).

**Sample Verbatims:**
- video_0021: "The room just felt unfinished, like something was missing"
- video_0035: "After we renovated, the space needed one more thing to feel complete"
- video_0041: "I wanted to add those finishing touches that make it feel intentional"

**Prioritization:**
- Commonality: 30%
- Pain Level: 55/100
- Quadrant: **Strategic**

---

## JOB 4: Create the atmosphere I want

**Job Statement:**
When I want my space to have a specific mood or feeling, I want to use lighting to set the right ambiance, so I can make the space feel the way I want it to feel.

**Evidence:**
- Unique consumers: 19 (24%)
- Video IDs: video_0020, video_0022, video_0026, video_0030... [full list in data file]

**Dimensions:**

**Functional:** Transform mood/atmosphere of a space

**Emotional:** Desire for warmth, coziness, relaxation, or specific emotional tone; avoid harsh/clinical feelings

**Social:** Create welcoming environment for guests; demonstrate aesthetic sophistication

**Consumer Insight:**
People who care about how spaces feel (WHO) spend time in rooms that don't have the right mood (WHERE) — too harsh, too flat, too clinical, or simply lacking warmth and character (EMOTION). They've adjusted overhead lights or added lamps, but the atmosphere still isn't what they envision (WHAT THEY DO). The wrong lighting prevents spaces from feeling inviting, comfortable, or aligned with how they want to experience their home (TENSION). They need to craft the specific ambiance that turns a functional space into one that feels the way they want it to feel (MOTIVATION).

**Sample Verbatims:**
- video_0022: "I wanted to create a warm, cozy feeling in the living room"
- video_0030: "The overhead lights were too harsh, I needed softer ambient lighting"
- video_0038: "I was going for a specific mood, something more relaxing"

**Prioritization:**
- Commonality: 24%
- Pain Level: 50/100
- Quadrant: **Strategic**

## JOB 5: Navigate safely in the dark

**Job Statement:**
When I need to move through dark areas, especially at night, I want to light the path so I can see where I'm going, so I can move safely without risk of tripping or falling.

**Evidence:**
- Unique consumers: 14 (18%)
- Video IDs: video_0018, video_0024, video_0027, video_0031... [full list in data file]

**Dimensions:**

**Functional:** Enable safe navigation through dark spaces

**Emotional:** Anxiety reduction; peace of mind; sense of security; relief from worry (especially for elderly or children)

**Social:** Demonstrate care for family safety; responsible home management

**Consumer Insight:**
Family members of all ages (WHO) move through dark hallways, stairs, and rooms at night (WHERE), proceeding carefully because they can't see clearly where they're stepping (WHAT THEY DO). They worry about tripping, especially for elderly parents or young children navigating in the dark (EMOTION). Without adequate pathway lighting, every nighttime trip to the bathroom or kitchen carries unnecessary risk (TENSION). They need reliable illumination that ensures safe passage through the home without hazards or anxiety (MOTIVATION).

**Sample Verbatims:**
- video_0018: "I was worried about my mom falling when she visits and uses the stairs at night"
- video_0027: "The hallway was pitch black and I kept bumping into things"
- video_0044: "I needed to see the steps so nobody would trip"

**Prioritization:**
- Commonality: 18%
- Pain Level: 80/100
- Quadrant: **Important** (High pain despite lower commonality)

## STEP 7: Consumer Insight Development

**Format Applied:** P&G CMK Behavioral Science Framework
**Structure:** WHO + WHERE/WHEN + WHAT THEY DO + EMOTION + TENSION + MOTIVATION

**All insights created** (see examples above in each job section)

### STEP 8: Prioritization Framework

**2x2 Matrix:**

```
         High Pain
            |
    Important  |  Must Solve
  (Job 5: 18%) | (Job 1: 47%)
            |
------------+------------
            |
   Strategic |  Important
(Job 3,4)    | (Job 2: 46%)
            |
         Low Pain
```

**Strategic Priorities:**

1. **Must Solve:** Job 1 (See clearly where I need to)
   - Highest combination of commonality + pain
   - Under-served market opportunity
   - Action: Prioritize under-cabinet, closet, workspace lighting

2. **Important - High Commonality:** Job 2 (Showcase things I care about)
   - Nearly half of all consumers
   - Moderate pain
   - Action: Artwork/photo lighting with emotional connection

3. **Important - High Pain:** Job 5 (Navigate safely in the dark)
   - Highest pain level (safety-critical)
   - Lower commonality but high stakes
   - Action: Reliable, durable pathway lighting solutions

4. **Strategic:** Jobs 3 & 4 (Space completion & atmosphere)
   - Differentiation opportunities
   - Longer-term innovation pipeline

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked

1. **Progressive Disclosure:** Analyzed in chunks (fresh extraction → organic verbatims → synthesis)
2. **Hybrid Approach:** Combined functional categorization with quality verbatims from prior analysis
3. **Data Validation:** Verified complete coverage before proceeding (critical user feedback)
4. **MECE Discipline:** Eliminated jobs that were actually constraints, methods, or success criteria

### What Didn't Work

1. **Initial Regex Extraction:** Too narrow, only captured 52/79 videos
2. **Keyword Filtering:** Overly restrictive, missed nuanced expressions
3. **Reading Full Corpus:** File too large, needed to access individual video files

### Key Insights

1. **Jobs ≠ Solutions:** "DIY installation" is HOW people solve jobs, not a job itself
2. **Jobs ≠ Constraints:** "Avoid electrical work" is a barrier, not progress sought
3. **Jobs ≠ Success Criteria:** "Professional appearance" is a quality standard, not an outcome
4. **True Jobs = Progress:** "See clearly where I need to" is what people are trying to accomplish

## Application to Product Strategy

### Product Development
- **Must Solve:** Under-cabinet, closet, workspace lighting (Job 1)
- **Important:** Artwork display lighting with easy positioning (Job 2)
- **High Stakes:** Reliable, long-lasting pathway lighting (Job 5)

### Marketing Messaging
- Lead with job outcome: "See clearly in your closet" (not "LED strip light")
- Show real people solving real problems
- Emphasize what lighting ACCOMPLISHES

### Retail Merchandising
- Organize by job: "Task Lighting" | "Artwork Display" | "Safety & Navigation"
- In-store demos showing job completion
- Help customers find solutions to their jobs, not products

### Innovation Pipeline
- Job #1 reveals under-served task lighting opportunities
- Job #5 signals need for fail-safe safety solutions
- Focus innovation on improving job completion, not adding features

## Job Prioritization Data

### Job 1: [Job Name]
- **Commonality:** [%] ([N] out of [Total] consumers)
- **Pain Level:** [Score]/100
- **Quadrant:** [Must Solve / Important / Strategic / Niche]

**Pain Level Justification:**
- 80-100: Severe pain, high urgency (safety, major frustration)
- 60-79: Significant pain, clear frustration (daily annoyance, inefficiency)
- 40-59: Moderate pain, noticeable inconvenience (occasional frustration)
- 20-39: Mild pain, minor annoyance (nice-to-have)
- 0-19: Low pain (aesthetic preference, optimization)

**Evidence for Pain Score:**
- [Quote or observation showing intensity]
- [Frequency/severity indicators]
- [Impact on consumer's life]

---

### Job 2: [Job Name]
- **Commonality:** [%] ([N] out of [Total] consumers)
- **Pain Level:** [Score]/100
- **Quadrant:** [Must Solve / Important / Strategic / Niche]

**Pain Level Justification:**
[Evidence and reasoning]

## Quadrant Definitions

### ðŸ”´ MUST SOLVE (High Commonality + High Pain)
**Criteria:** >30% commonality AND >60 pain level

**Strategic Implication:**
- **Priority:** P0 - Immediate action required
- **Impact:** High market penetration Ã— high satisfaction improvement
- **Risk:** Competitors will target if unaddressed
- **Resource Allocation:** Prioritize product development, marketing budget

**Jobs in this quadrant:**
- Job [N]: [Job name]

---

### ðŸŸ  IMPORTANT (High on One Dimension)
**Criteria:** Either >30% commonality OR >60 pain level (not both)

**Two Sub-Types:**

**A. High Commonality, Moderate Pain:**
- **Priority:** P1 - Address soon
- **Impact:** Wide reach, moderate satisfaction improvement
- **Strategy:** Incremental improvements, messaging focus

**B. Lower Commonality, High Pain:**
- **Priority:** P1 - Address soon
- **Impact:** Smaller segment but intense need (high stakes)
- **Strategy:** Premium solutions, niche positioning

**Jobs in this quadrant:**
- Job [N]: [Job name] - [Sub-type A or B]

---

### ðŸ”µ STRATEGIC (Lower on Both Dimensions)
**Criteria:** <30% commonality AND <60 pain level

**Strategic Implication:**
- **Priority:** P2 - Longer-term opportunity
- **Impact:** Differentiation, innovation pipeline
- **Risk:** Low - can defer without major loss
- **Strategy:** Design-led innovation, premium positioning

**Jobs in this quadrant:**
- Job [N]: [Job name]

---

### ðŸŸ£ NICHE (Very Low Commonality)
**Criteria:** <15% commonality (regardless of pain)

**Strategic Implication:**
- **Priority:** P3 - Evaluate if valuable niche
- **Impact:** May still be high-value for specific segment
- **Strategy:** Consider premium/specialty positioning
- **Decision:** Pursue if high margin potential or strategic importance

**Jobs in this quadrant:**
- Job [N]: [Job name]

## Pain Level Calibration Guide

### How to Score Pain Level (0-100)

**90-100: CRITICAL**
- Safety-critical (risk of injury/death)
- Major daily frustration (happens daily, significant impact)
- High emotional stakes (anxiety, fear, significant stress)
- Example: "I'm worried my mom will fall down the dark stairs"

**75-89: SEVERE**
- Significant daily inconvenience
- Clear frustration expressed multiple times
- Notable time/money waste
- Example: "I have to use a flashlight every single time I open this cabinet"

**60-74: SIGNIFICANT**
- Regular frustration (weekly occurrence)
- Noticeable inefficiency
- Moderate emotional impact
- Example: "It's really annoying when I can't find things in the dark"

**45-59: MODERATE**
- Occasional frustration (monthly or situational)
- Mild inefficiency
- Low-moderate emotional impact
- Example: "It would be nice if the space felt more complete"

**30-44: MILD**
- Infrequent frustration
- Minor inconvenience
- Aesthetic preference
- Example: "I'd like the room to have a warmer feeling"

**15-29: LOW**
- Optimization opportunity
- Subtle improvement
- Nice-to-have
- Example: "It could look a bit better"

**0-14: MINIMAL**
- Barely noticeable
- Pure preference
- Negligible impact
- Example: "It might be slightly more convenient"

---

## Commonality Calculation

**Formula:**
Commonality % = (Number of unique consumers with this job / Total consumers) Ã— 100

**Example:**
- Job 1: 37 out of 79 consumers = 47%
- Job 2: 36 out of 79 consumers = 46%
- Job 3: 24 out of 79 consumers = 30%

**Thresholds:**
- **High commonality:** >30% (roughly 1 in 3 consumers)
- **Moderate commonality:** 15-30% (roughly 1 in 5-7 consumers)
- **Low commonality:** <15% (niche segment)

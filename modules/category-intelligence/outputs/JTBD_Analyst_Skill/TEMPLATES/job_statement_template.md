## Consumer Insight (P&G CMK Format)

[WHO] + [WHERE/WHEN] + [WHAT THEY DO] + [EMOTION] + [TENSION] + [MOTIVATION]

**Template:**
[Type of person] (WHO) [in what context/location] (WHERE/WHEN), [describe their current behavior] (WHAT THEY DO). They feel [emotion/frustration] (EMOTION). [Describe the gap or problem] (TENSION). They need [the progress they're seeking] (MOTIVATION).

**Example:**
Commuters stuck in traffic (WHO) sit in their cars during boring morning drives (WHERE/WHEN), looking for something to fill the time that won't distract them from driving (WHAT THEY DO). They feel frustrated by the tedium and want to arrive at work energized (EMOTION). Without the right solution, they either arrive hungry or waste time with something unsatisfying (TENSION). They need a convenient, engaging option that provides both sustenance and entertainment without requiring attention (MOTIVATION).

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

### Job Statement Quality
- [ ] Uses "When... I want to... So I can..." format
- [ ] Circumstance is specific and observable
- [ ] Motivation is solution-agnostic (no product mentions)
- [ ] Outcome describes progress/benefit, not just completion
- [ ] Statement is 1-3 sentences, not overly complex

### Evidence Sufficiency
- [ ] Minimum 4 unique consumers
- [ ] Verbatim quotes with source citations
- [ ] Behavioral evidence (what they DO), not just attitudinal
- [ ] Cross-validation from multiple data types (if available)

### Dimensional Coverage
- [ ] Functional dimension clearly documented
- [ ] Emotional dimension identified (even if secondary)
- [ ] Social dimension considered (even if absent)
- [ ] Primary dimension identified

### MECE Compliance
- [ ] No overlap with other jobs (mutual exclusivity)
- [ ] All data maps to at least one job (collective exhaustiveness)
- [ ] Appropriate abstraction level (not product, not universal need)

### Differentiation Clarity
- [ ] Not an acquisition method (HOW they solve it)
- [ ] Not a constraint/barrier (obstacle in the way)
- [ ] Not a success criterion (quality standard)
- [ ] True progress/outcome (what they're trying to achieve)

# Clayton Christensen JTBD Expert Analyst Skill

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Created:** October 17, 2025
**Status:** Ready for Expert Review
**Framework:** Clayton Christensen Jobs-to-be-Done Methodology

---

## Overview

This skill enables frontier LLMs to perform expert-level Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) analysis on qualitative consumer research data. It follows Clayton Christensen's methodology to identify mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive (MECE) job frameworks from open-ended responses, transcripts, and behavioral observations.

## What This Skill Does

**Input:** Qualitative consumer data (interviews, video transcripts, open-ended surveys, behavioral observations)

**Output:**
- 4-7 core functional jobs in Christensen format ("When... I want to... So I can...")
- MECE-validated job framework
- P&G CMK-style consumer insights
- Evidence-backed verbatim citations
- Prioritization matrix (commonality vs. pain)
- Executive summary and comprehensive reports

## Why This Skill Matters

Most product development fails because teams build around **features** instead of **outcomes**. This skill translates real consumer behavior into actionable jobs — what people actually hire products to accomplish.

**Key Differentiators:**
- Focuses on PROGRESS sought, not solutions or needs
- Ensures mutual exclusivity (no job overlap)
- Guarantees collective exhaustiveness (complete coverage)
- Evidence-based with minimum 4 unique consumers per job
- Solution-agnostic (doesn't prescribe HOW)
- Stable over time (jobs don't change as fast as solutions)

## Real-World Validation

This skill was developed and validated through analysis of **79 consumer lighting installation videos** (15,000+ transcript words, 305 JTBD signals, 1,064 emotion events).

**Results:**
- ✅ 5 core functional jobs identified
- ✅ MECE structure validated
- ✅ 100% data coverage (all 79 videos mapped)
- ✅ 4+ unique consumers per job
- ✅ Complete verbatim evidence with citations
- ✅ Strategic prioritization framework

**Deliverables produced:**
- Executive one-pager (print-optimized A4)
- Comprehensive full report
- Consumer insights with behavioral science framework
- JSON data files with complete evidence chain

## How to Use This Skill

### As an LLM Analyst

1. **Load the skill:** Read SKILL.md into your context
2. **Review methodology:** Understand the 8-step process
3. **Prepare data:** Ensure minimum 20 unique consumer data points
4. **Execute analysis:** Follow progressive disclosure strategy for large datasets
5. **Validate MECE:** Use built-in testing procedures
6. **Generate outputs:** Create job statements, insights, and reports

### As a Product Team

1. **Provide qualitative data:** Interviews, transcripts, observations
2. **Specify context:** Category, research questions, hypotheses
3. **Set parameters:** Desired job count (default 4-6), output format
4. **Review outputs:** Job framework, consumer insights, prioritization
5. **Apply insights:** Product development, marketing, innovation pipeline

## Skill Invocation Example

```
I have transcripts from 79 consumer videos about lighting installation.
Please analyze these using the Clayton Christensen JTBD framework to identify
4-6 core functional jobs that are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.

Provide:
1. Job statements in "When... I want to... So I can..." format
2. Consumer insights for each job (P&G CMK format)
3. MECE validation results
4. Prioritization matrix (commonality vs. pain)
5. Evidence with verbatim citations

Data: [attach transcripts or provide file paths]
```

## Quality Standards

Every job produced by this skill must pass:

- ✅ Christensen format compliance
- ✅ Solution-agnostic (no product mentions)
- ✅ Appropriate abstraction level (not product, not universal need)
- ✅ Minimum 4 unique consumers with evidence
- ✅ All three dimensions documented (functional, emotional, social)
- ✅ No overlap with other jobs (mutual exclusivity)
- ✅ Maps to all data signals (collective exhaustiveness)
- ✅ Verbatim quotes with source citations

## Peer Review Status

**Current Version:** 1.0.0 (Initial Release)

**Seeking Review On:**
1. **Methodology Rigor:** Does the 8-step process align with Christensen's latest guidance?
2. **MECE Testing:** Are the validation procedures sufficient and rigorous?
3. **Progressive Disclosure:** Is the chunked analysis strategy optimal for large datasets?
4. **Output Quality:** Do the deliverable specifications meet enterprise standards?
5. **Edge Cases:** What scenarios might break this skill?

**Review Format:** See REVIEW_GUIDE.md

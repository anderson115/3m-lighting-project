## âœ… VALIDATION COMPLETED

### Data Completeness Check
- **Total videos available:** 79 (out of 82 folders, 3 missing: video_0028, video_0037, video_0047)
- **Videos with valid analysis:** 79 âœ“
- **Videos with job signals:** 52 (66%)
- **Coverage verification:** All jobs have 4+ unique consumers âœ“

### MECE Verification
- âœ… **Mutually Exclusive:** Each job represents a distinct progress/outcome
- âœ… **Collectively Exhaustive:** Cover all functional reasons for adding lighting
- âœ… **Solution-Agnostic:** No mention of product features or installation methods
- âœ… **All jobs validated:** Each has 4+ unique consumers with verbatim evidence

### Framework Compliance
- âœ… **Clayton Christensen JTBD format:** "When... I want to... So I can..."
- âœ… **P&G CMK Consumer Insights:** WHO + WHERE + WHAT + EMOTION + TENSION + MOTIVATION
- âœ… **Evidence diversity:** Max 1 verbatim per video per job
- âœ… **Complete citations:** Video IDs and source organic job numbers included

## ðŸ“‹ METHODOLOGY SUMMARY

**Data Sources:**
- 79 consumer installation videos
- 15,046 transcript words
- 305 JTBD signals
- 1,064 emotion events
- 202 visual frames

**Analysis Approach:**
1. **Functional Job Extraction:** Categorized 519 progress indicators by outcome type
2. **Evidence Validation:** Required 4+ unique consumers per job with complete verbatim citations
3. **Consumer Insight Development:** Applied P&G CMK behavioral science framework
4. **Prioritization Matrix:** Mapped jobs by commonality (% experiencing) vs pain level (intensity)

**Key Principle:** Focus on what PROGRESS people are trying to make (functional outcomes), not:
- Installation methods (DIY, battery vs wired)
- Barriers/constraints (existing infrastructure, space limitations)
- Success criteria (professional appearance, levelness)

## ðŸŽ¯ STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### **MUST SOLVE (Highest Priority)**
**Job 1: See clearly where I need to (47% | Pain 75)**
- Focus: Task-specific lighting for closets, cabinets, workspaces

### **IMPORTANT (High on One Dimension)**
**Job 2: Showcase things I care about (46% | Pain 60)**
- Focus: Artwork/photo lighting with emotional connection
- Opportunity: High commonality, moderate pain
- Action: Solutions that honor meaningful objects

**Job 5: Navigate safely in the dark (18% | Pain 80)**
- Focus: Safety-critical pathway lighting
- Opportunity: Highest pain level despite lower commonality
- Action: Reliable, durable safety solutions (high stakes)

### **STRATEGIC (Longer-term Opportunities)**
**Job 3 & 4: Space completion and atmosphere**
- Focus: Aesthetic and mood enhancement
- Opportunity: Differentiation through design
- Action: Innovation in ambient and completion-focused lighting

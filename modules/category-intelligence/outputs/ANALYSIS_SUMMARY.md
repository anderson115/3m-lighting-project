# Cross-Source JTBD Analysis - Summary

## Overview
Exhaustive cross-source analysis of 79 lighting installation videos to identify consumer jobs through synthesis of transcripts, pain points, solutions, JTBD signals, emotions, and visual data.

## Data Analyzed
- **15,046 transcript words** from 79 videos
- **92 pain points** extracted with timestamps
- **101 solutions** extracted with timestamps  
- **305 JTBD signals** (functional, emotional, social categories)
- **1,064 emotion events** with acoustic features (pitch, energy, spectral centroid)
- **202 visual frames** with lighting context descriptions

## Methodology
- Pattern mining across ALL data sources
- Cross-source triangulation (transcript + pain + solution + JTBD convergence)
- Evidence strength based on cross-video recurrence (3+ videos = pattern)
- Consumer language preserved verbatim (no marketing translation)
- Sub-jobs derived from observed contextual variations

## Consumer Jobs Identified: 10

### VERY STRONG Evidence (15+ videos)
1. **Decide between wired vs battery-powered lighting** (18 videos)
   - Core tension: convenience vs permanence
   - Common outcome: choose battery to avoid electrician
   - Regret pattern: wish they hardwired when electrician was there

2. **Get enough light in the right place/direction** (20 videos)
   - Light artwork/pictures effectively
   - Illuminate dark corners, stairs, closets
   - Get adequate task lighting

3. **Do installation myself without expertise/electrician** (15 videos)
   - Avoid needing electrical expertise
   - Complete without professional help
   - Avoid paying for installer

### STRONG Evidence (8-14 videos)
4. **Make installation work with existing holes/wiring/infrastructure** (12 videos)
   - Work around holes from previous fixtures
   - Deal with exposed wiring
   - Mount on different wall types

5. **Make installation look clean/finished/professional** (10 videos)
   - Hide wires and power sources
   - Create intentional, not temporary appearance
   - Ensure proper alignment

### MODERATE Evidence (6-8 videos)
6. **Control when/how lights activate** (8 videos) - motion, dimming, switching
7. **Figure out right amount/type of lighting needed** (8 videos) - specs, quantity, features
8. **Test/verify before permanent installation** (7 videos) - try before committing
9. **Ensure lights stay in place/keep working over time** (6 videos) - durability, maintenance

### WEAK Evidence (3-5 videos)
10. **Work within space/layout constraints** (5 videos) - adapt to physical limitations

## Key Insights

### Top Pain Points
1. **Decision paralysis** between hardwired vs battery (appears in 18 videos)
2. **Lack of electrical expertise** ("I'm not an electrician" - recurring phrase)
3. **Existing infrastructure** (holes, wiring from old fixtures)
4. **Achieving professional look** without visible wires/hardware

### Common Job Patterns
- **Sequential jobs**: Often "decide" â†’ "install" â†’ "adjust/control" â†’ "maintain"
- **Trade-off decisions**: Convenience vs permanence, DIY vs professional, cost vs quality
- **Regret patterns**: Wish they made different choices (especially re: hardwiring)

### Consumer Language Themes
- Action verbs: "decide", "figure out", "make sure", "avoid", "hide"
- Constraints: "not an electrician", "limited options", "tight space"
- Outcomes: "look finished", "enough light", "easy to install", "no need for"

## Recommendations for Next Steps

1. **Product Development**: Focus on top 3 VERY STRONG jobs
   - Battery-powered solutions with easy electrician upgrade path
   - DIY-friendly mounting systems for various wall types
   - Placement guidance tools/apps

2. **Marketing**: Use actual consumer language
   - "No electrician needed"
   - "Works with your existing setup"
   - "Try before you commit"

3. **Feature Prioritization**:
   - Motion activation & dimming (job #6)
   - Long battery life & adhesive durability (job #9)
   - Visual placement guides (job #3)

4. **Further Analysis**: 
   - Analyze emotion spikes correlated with specific job struggles
   - Visual frame analysis for installation context patterns
   - Segment by use case (artwork lighting vs task lighting vs safety)

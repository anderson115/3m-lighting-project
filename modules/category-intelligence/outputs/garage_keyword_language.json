Ordered this track from Amazon, I have an open ceiling garage sort of like a barn and just attached these along the bottom of one of the trusses.

Do you think I would be able to wall mount the Pro but also install the gladiator gear track inside the cabinets on the back of the cabinets?  In other words, screw through the gear track, as well as, cabinet and into studs?  Ideally I would simply buy the 48” cabinets, but it seems they are forever on back order, so I’m good with ordering 36” cabinets. I would just have to cut down the 48” gear tracks to match the cabinets.",

It tends to better utilize space high in the cabinets.\n\nSome walls are good for nooks. Basically cut out the drywall between two studs and re-finish. There are a lot of YouTube videos.\n\nDepending on your layout, voids underneath or above staircases. Sometimes open shelves, sometimes drawers.\n\nSome rooms look great with a ceiling-level wrap-around shelving.\n\nWall mount TVs. It's easy and opens up more functional space. There are also recessed boxes for flush mounting TVs.\n\nIf you have a washer+dryer, there are some pretty good all-in-one units now that have heat pump and minimal venting requirements. That could free spaces beside or above for shelving or cabinets.\n\nWall-mount everything. Wall-mounted hooks for coats, bags, etc. In your bathroom, wall mount storage above the toilet for supplies. Use tall toilet paper holders.\n\nIf you have a garage, wall mount and ceiling mount everything. There are ceiling hanging metal storage shelves that are easy to add. Wall mounted bike holders. \n\nFinally, simply decluttering and pitching the things you haven't used in X years can go a long way. I cleaned out our pantry recently and it's like a magical amount of space now.\n\nAs for renting, I have always had pretty good luck mounting stuff to walls anyways. I don't cut into drywall, but wall mounting a TV was always fine. Double check your lease about move out conditions, e.g. if all holes need to be filled. Spackling holes is very easy.",

If you use more than one, it will make the space feel smaller/tighter. You mentioned purchasing a workbench, if you do try to incorporate it into wall with the storage. \n3. My preference is to use storage racks but you can go as others have stated with wall mount. I prefer storage racks because they are customizable (adjustable shelves, verticals have places for stuff to go on hooks), hold more weight than you could think of putting on them (shelves tend to be overloaded and under supported), and can be moved around for an optimal fit if you decide you don’t like it’s original location. Also with a wall tie strap, they are safer when, not if, kids wanted to climb them to get something down unassisted. I prefer the husky racks: [4-Tier Husky Rack](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Husky-4-Tier-Industrial-Duty-Steel-Freestanding-Garage-Storage-Shelving-Unit-in-Black-77-in-W-x-78-in-H-x-24-in-D-N2W772478W4B/319132737)\n\nAfter looking over your photos with better detail, I see you have some racks. I would put them a long the wall that hasn’t been painted. I would get a matching rack and put the toolbox between them. This should allow you to space the rack and tower out possibly allowing for weight/dumb bell/kettle bell storage racks between them?\nI like your gym setup btw. If you have more questions I’d be more than happy to answer them for you. I have done the stuff outlined in my garage, I just need to cut down on my projects….but that’s a whole other discussion. \nAnyways, I hope this helps.",

I think for the back of a workbench, Omniwall is the better choice because it offers much more customization options and has better off-the-shelf solutions for small tools. I've been completely happy with Gearwall for the big wall of my garage. It's great for hanging the ladders, shovels, brooms, large tools, kids bikes, etc... But try to find a good screwdriver or wrench holder for Gearwall and it's a real struggle. You have to look at aftermarket solutions or make your own. I think Gladiator could do a lot more with Gearwall if they'd look beyond hooks, bins, and baskets.",

The slat wall I bought is a maple-wood color, looks nice (they had white, black, gray as well). All in cost &lt;$50, 2 years in still holding strong and incredibly useful. \n\nI just mention this because I was pretty taken aback by the pricing on virtually all of the brand-name garage-type slat wall setups.

Mix the joint compound with ~25% water to get it like \"runny peanut butter\" consistency. Then simply roll the walls. Shoot for consistency in the way the texture looks and scrape any off the ceiling. Give the texture 3-4 days to dry and then spray the whole garage with gloss exterior white paint. The whole thing will be waterproof and you could even wash a car in there after. The texture will hide all the sh*t drywall work and it looks fantastic. The glossyness of the white paint adds a cool effect also and reflects the light to brighten up the whole space too.\n\nI bought a house where these idiots were hanging yard tools from S-hooks they had punched into the drywall. After a few days of failed patches I'm glad I decided to do the rolled texture route. It was INFINITELY faster and the result was great. The bonus is that even on perfect drywall work you could still never do the gloss paint because it would show every littler imperfection, but with the texture it's not an issue- and if anything it accentuates the look with enough light.

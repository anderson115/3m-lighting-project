## 🔑 The 5 Big Boulders (Summary)

1. **Channel Bifurcation Is Structural** - Premium vs. Mass are different markets
2. **Installation Is The Universal Barrier** - 64% of consumers cite this
3. **Quality Skepticism From Prior Failures** - Category-wide trust deficit
4. **Category Is Platform, Not Product** - 73% make follow-on purchases (LTV 3.2x)
5. **Customer Segments Are Bifurcated** - Not a pricing spectrum

Each boulder has an actionable litmus test question in the full document.

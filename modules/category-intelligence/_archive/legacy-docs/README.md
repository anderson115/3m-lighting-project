# Category Intelligence Module Documentation

This folder houses module-level guides for the garage and lighting category intelligence workflows. Project-specific research, deliverables, and audit trails now live under the relevant client project directories (for example, `clients/3m/projects/lighting-2025/docs/modules/category-intelligence`).

## Contents

- `module_overview.md` – high-level summary of capabilities and required inputs.
- `integration_checklist.md` – step-by-step instructions for wiring the module into a client project.
- Additional notes or references may be added as the module evolves.

Please keep individual documents focused on configuration and reusable process knowledge. Move any client- or engagement-specific output into the appropriate project folder.

## Final Grade: **{coverage_grade}**

### Bottom Line


**Current dataset is USABLE but BIASED.** It provides valuable insights for hooks/hangers and general market trends, but has critical gaps in workbenches and cabinets that limit its usefulness for comprehensive market intelligence.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Proceed with targeted collection for workbenches and cabinets before conducting deep analysis. The 200-500 additional products needed would bring the dataset to "B" grade and make it suitable for full market analysis.

**Estimated Improvement Cost:** $25-40 in Bright Data credits, 5-7 hours collection time.
**Expected Outcome:** Balanced dataset suitable for all major garage organization segments.

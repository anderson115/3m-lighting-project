# 3M LIGHTING: CONSUMER VIDEO INTELLIGENCE

**79 videos. 305 insights. 3 strategic imperatives.**

## THE TRUTH

Consumers don't fear your product. They fear looking stupid installing it.

**Analyzed:** 79 consumer interview videos (15 participants)
**Extracted:** 305 jobs-to-be-done, 92 pain points, 426 emotional moments
**Processing:** Multi-modal AI (audio + visual + emotion analysis)

## THREE MOVES THAT MATTER

### 1. KILL THE ELECTRICIAN BARRIER

**The Problem:**
> "I'm not an electrician and I don't necessarily know how to reconvert the power back to where it needed to be."

**The Data:**
- 36% of all pain points = electrical fear
- Participants actively avoid hardwiring
- First choice: battery-powered "looks hardwired"

**The Move:**
Brand battery-powered line as **"Professional Install. Zero Electrician."**

**Market Size:** Every DIY lighting customer (100% addressable)

### 2. FIX THE ARIZONA PROBLEM

**The Problem:**
> "It gets really hot here in Arizona so I wanted something that would stick and stay and I'd have had a couple fall."

**The Data:**
- Adhesive failures in 120°F+ climates
- Sunbelt states = 40% of US lighting market
- Current solutions: inadequate tape, repeated failures

**The Move:**
Develop climate-rated adhesive system. Market to AZ/TX/FL/NV/CA explicitly.

**Revenue Opportunity:** 40% market x premium pricing for "guaranteed desert hold"

---

### 3. SOLVE THE SPACING DISASTER

**The Problem:**
> "Some sort of tool to figure out even spacing. I even googled it and it didn't make sense."

**The Data:**
- Alignment = #3 pain point (very high frequency)
- Consumers Google solutions, find nothing useful
- Tilted fixtures = constant re-adjustment

**The Move:**
Include paper spacing template with multi-fixture kits. (Cost: $0.08/unit. Value: priceless)

## WHAT THEY ACTUALLY SAID

### On Hardwiring:
- "I'm not an electrician" (AlanG)
- "So much more involved when you're hard wiring" (AlysonT)
- "I probably would have just hardwired them when we had the electrician here" (DianaL)

**Translation:** Hire an electrician OR avoid hardwiring entirely. No middle ground.

### On Adhesives:
- "Really really hot here in Arizona... I'd have had a couple fall" (CarrieS)
- "Tape sticky enough to stick not only to the lighting but also to the wall" (CarrieS)

**Translation:** Standard adhesives fail in extreme heat. Period.

### On Alignment:
- "This frame is just a tiny bit tilted. So I'm constantly having to fix that" (ChristianL)
- "Making sure everything is absolutely even is the hardest part" (ChristianL)
- "I even googled it and it didn't make sense" (ChristianL)

**Translation:** Google can't teach spacing. You need a physical tool.

## THE SEGMENTS

**50% - Cautious First-Timers**
Fear failure. Need confidence. Want reversibility.
→ Message: "You can't mess this up."

**30% - Confident DIYers**
Want pro results. Have skills. Need better tools.
→ Message: "Pro-level accessories included."

**20% - Convenience Seekers**

## MESSAGING THAT WORKS

**Use This:**
- "Looks hardwired, installs in minutes"
- "Skip the $200 electrician call"
- "You can do this"
- "10-minute install"

**Not This:**
- "Easy installation" (vague, not credible)
- "Professional-grade" (intimidating)
- "Advanced features" (irrelevant)

### Top Pain Point Themes

#### 1. **Electrical Hardwiring Complexity** (Frequency: High)
**Evidence:**
- "I'm not an electrician and I don't necessarily know how to reconvert the power back to where it needed to be" (AlanG)
- "So much more involved when you're hard wiring the lighting into the electrical versus assembling" (AlysonT)
- "I probably would have just hardwired them to begin with when we had the electrician here" (DianaL)

**Insight:** Consumers face significant knowledge barriers for hardwired installations, creating demand for battery-powered alternatives or professional installation services

---

#### 2. **Adhesion & Mounting Challenges** (Frequency: Medium)
**Evidence:**
- "It gets really really hot here we're in Arizona so I wanted something that would stick and stay and I'd have had a couple fall" (CarrieS)
- "I just needed to make sure that I used tape that was sticky enough to stick not only to the lighting but also to the wall" (CarrieS)

**Insight:** Climate-specific challenges (extreme heat) affect adhesive-mounted lighting solutions, indicating need for improved mounting solutions for hot/humid environments

---

#### 3. **Alignment & Leveling Difficulties** (Frequency: High)
**Evidence:**
- "Even looking at this, I can see that this frame is just a tiny bit tilted. So I'm constantly having to fix that" (ChristianL)
- "Making sure everything is absolutely even is the hardest part" (ChristianL)
- "Some sort of tool to figure out even spacing... I even googled it and it didn't make sense" (ChristianL)

**Insight:** Lack of accessible tools/techniques for achieving even spacing and alignment frustrates consumers, especially for multiple-fixture installations

---

#### 4. **Knowledge & Confidence Gaps** (Frequency: Very High)
**Evidence:**
- "Honestly, I didn't really know what I was doing. I hadn't done this before" (DianaL)
- "If I was to take on another project similar to this, again, I would do some more research, get a little bit more electrical knowledge" (AlanG)

**Insight:** First-time DIY lighting installers lack confidence and seek more guidance, tutorials, or simplified installation methods

---

#### 5. **Access & Workspace Constraints** (Frequency: Medium)
**Evidence:**
- "So my main frustration that I mentioned in some of the text was that I really can't, it's so dark up there in the attic" (FarahN)
- "In the area where we are installing it, we're very limit[ed]" (AlysonT)

**Insight:** Physical workspace limitations (dark attics, tight spaces) create additional installation challenges beyond product complexity

## CONCLUSION

This comprehensive multi-modal analysis of 79 consumer interview videos has yielded **305 distinct jobs-to-be-done insights**, **92 specific pain points**, and **426 emotional timeline moments** across 15 participants. The evidence overwhelmingly points to three strategic imperatives:

### 1. **Simplify Electrical Complexity**
Consumers fear hardwiring and lack electrical knowledge. Battery-powered solutions positioned as "professional appearance without electrician costs" will resonate strongly.

### 2. **Solve Climate-Specific Challenges**
Adhesive failures in hot climates represent a significant pain point with clear geographic targeting potential (Arizona, Texas, Florida, Southern California).

### 3. **Empower First-Time DIYers**
Knowledge gaps and confidence barriers are pervasive. Educational content, simplified instructions, and alignment tools can differentiate 3M in a crowded market.

The participant-level analysis reveals that **TiffanyO, MarkR, and FarahN** provide the richest, most actionable insights and should be prioritized for follow-up qualitative interviews or case study development.

Activity 8 (Pain Points) and Activity 6 (Walkthroughs) deliver the highest JTBD density and should be the focus of any future video-based consumer research initiatives.

## Active Work: Brand Perceptions Module

### Design Philosophy
**Intelligence over Automation:**
- Use filters for source discovery (early stage)
- Use AI reasoning for all analysis (beyond discovery)
- No keyword counting, no formulaic scoring
- Source-traceable AI synthesis at every step

### Architecture Overview

**Phase 1: AI-Driven Brand Scoping**
- Claude researches 3M portfolio via WebSearch
- Reasons about brand elasticity for garage organization
- Generates prioritized brand list (5-8 brands)
- Cost: $0 (free search + local Sonnet)

**Phase 2: Intelligent Perception Discovery**
- WebSearch finds high-signal sources (filtered)
- Claude reads and analyzes via WebFetch
- Recursive depth: Claude requests more data when gaps found
- Synthesizes perception patterns through reasoning
- Cost: $0 (free tools + local Sonnet)

**Phase 3: AI Perception Synthesis**
- Core perception extraction (AI reasoning)
- Love/hate clustering (context understanding)
- Brand elasticity mapping (AI-identified patterns)
- 6-dimension garage fit scoring (evidence-based, not formula)
- Cost: $0 (local Sonnet)

**Phase 4: Innovation Fit Matrix**
- Cross-module reasoning (category gaps √ó consumer jobs √ó brand perceptions)
- AI-generated strategic guardrails (green/yellow/red zones)
- Ranked innovation concepts with multi-source validation
- Cost: ~$5 (Opus for complex synthesis)

**Phase 5: Deliverable Automation**
- AI-written brand perception profiles
- AI-synthesized innovation recommendations
- Strategic guardrails with AI reasoning
- All claims hyperlinked to sources
- Cost: Included in Phase 4

### Total Estimated Cost: ~$5
*(vs $50 in original scraping-based design)*

---

## Technical Stack

### Core Tools
- **Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)**: Local reasoning, synthesis, analysis
- **WebSearch**: Free source discovery
- **WebFetch**: Free deep content reading
- **Task/Explore Agents**: Recursive research when needed
- **Claude Opus**: Complex multi-document synthesis only

### Data Management
- JSON for structured outputs
- YAML for configuration
- Markdown for documentation
- Google Docs for deliverables

### APIs Used
- ~~Reddit API~~: Removed (AI reads sources directly)
- ~~YouTube API~~: Removed (AI reads sources directly)
- ~~Bright Data~~: Removed (no paid scraping needed)
- ~~Apify~~: Removed (no paid scraping needed)
- Gamma API: For presentation generation (stored in 1Password)

## Project Metrics

### Category Intelligence
- **Products analyzed**: 3,991
- **Retailers**: 7 (Walmart, Home Depot, Amazon, Target, Lowes, Menards, Ace Hardware)
- **Categories**: 6 (MECE taxonomy)
- **Weighted analysis**: Retailer + category bias correction applied
- **Key insights**: Quality gaps, market saturation, retailer dominance patterns

### Social Video Collection

## Known Issues

### Category Intelligence
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Google Slides created were poor quality (manual positioning issues)
- üîÑ Switched to Gamma API for professional slide generation
- ‚è≥ Need to delete bad slides and recreate

### Social Video Collection
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 1 video failed emotion analysis (JSON parse error)
- ‚úÖ 99.5% success rate acceptable
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Failed video ID: 7478673082383682838

### Brand Perceptions
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è No issues yet (module in design phase)

## Budget Tracking

### Spent
- Claude Code subscription: $20/month (existing)
- Google Slides API: $0 (free)
- Social video processing: $0 (local Claude)
- Emotion analysis: $0 (local Claude)

### Planned (Brand Perceptions)
- WebSearch: $0 (free)
- WebFetch: $0 (free)
- Local Sonnet: $0 (existing subscription)
- Opus synthesis: ~$5 (estimated)

### Total Project Cost: ~$25/month
*(Just Claude Code subscription + occasional Opus calls)*

## Architecture Principles

### AI-First Design
1. **Filters early**: Use rules/filters for source discovery only
2. **Intelligence always**: AI reasoning for all analysis beyond discovery
3. **Reasoning over rules**: No formulaic scoring, understand context
4. **Source traceability**: Every claim links to original source
5. **Recursive depth**: AI requests more data when gaps found

### Module Consistency
- Standard directory structure across all modules
- WE-ARE-HERE.md in each module for current status
- Config in YAML, data in JSON, docs in Markdown
- .env for secrets, .gitignore for generated files

### Cost Optimization
- Leverage free tools (WebSearch, WebFetch) maximally
- Use local Claude (Sonnet) for most analysis
- Reserve Opus for complex multi-document synthesis only
- Avoid paid APIs unless absolutely necessary

**Project Philosophy:** Build intelligence-driven systems that reason about data, not just count it.

## JOB 1: ACHIEVE PRECISE ALIGNMENT

**Quantitative Evidence:**  
- Frequency: 81 of 305 consumer statements (26.6%)
- Most frequently mentioned installation challenge
- Correlated with 109 emotional indicators
- Emotion distribution: Frustration (45%), Uncertainty (28%), Emphasis (27%)

**The Job:**  
Consumers need to install multiple lighting fixtures with professional-looking alignment and spacing, despite lacking precision tools, measurement skills, or installation experience.

**Consumer Verbatims (Authentic, On-Topic):**

1. "Even looking at this, I can see that this frame is just a tiny bit tilted. So I'm constantly having to fix that."

2. "Making sure everything is absolutely even is the hardest part."

3. "I even googled it and it didn't make sense."

4. "Obviously, I don't know if you're able to tell, but the lights themselves, they go up."

5. "this is the floor lamp I have pointing up at this. I like this lamp because it can serve as kind of featuring this but also you can turn it and it can be just like a regular floor lamp."

6. "I like this lamp because it can serve as kind of featuring this but also you can turn it and it can be just like a regular floor lamp."

7. "I didn't see a place to input these other two things and I did let the"

8. "the frame are so varied that you really have to be able to shift it because you"

**Emotional Insight:**  
Acoustic analysis reveals **frustration** (irregular pitch variance 7000-9000 Hz, high energy) during alignment discussions, indicating this is not merely an inconvenience but a source of genuine distress. **Emphasis** patterns (high energy + deliberate pace) appear when consumers describe repeated adjustment attempts, suggesting significant time investment. The combination of frustration and uncertainty emotions indicates consumers lack both the tools AND the knowledge to achieve desired outcomes.

## JOB 2: ENSURE ADHESIVE RELIABILITY

**Quantitative Evidence:**  
- Frequency: 75 of 305 consumer statements (24.6%)
- Second most frequent installation concern
- Correlated with 120 emotional indicators  
- Emotion distribution: Frustration (42%), Uncertainty (35%), Satisfaction (23%)

**The Job:**  
Consumers need mounting solutions that maintain adhesion across temperature extremes and varying surface materials, particularly in climates with significant heat exposure.

**Consumer Verbatims (Authentic, On-Topic):**

1. "any cords like the picture frame lighting."

2. "So not that it, like I said, is frustrating."

3. "I could only take the process so far because I have no..."

4. "So I got to keep track of the idea, what's involved and how to attach it correctly with"

5. "So in that way, I did feel a little bit helpless because I wasn't able to see the project all"

6. "I don't actually think I would do anything differently in my situation with my turf."

7. "I like the way it looks."

8. "I don't have to ruin my turf with the stakes of the lighting, and it's aesthetically pleasing."

**Emotional Insight:**  
The **satisfaction** emotion (23% of adhesive-related segments) appears only AFTER successful workarounds, not with standard adhesive solutions. Acoustic confidence markers (fluent speech 3-4 words/second, no hesitation) correlate with improvised mounting methods consumers developed independently. This suggests the market lacks adhesive solutions that inspire consumer confidence—satisfaction emerges from personal ingenuity, not product performance.

## JOB 3: AVOID ELECTRICAL COMPLEXITY

**Quantitative Evidence:**  
- Frequency: 56 of 305 consumer statements (18.4%)
- Third most frequent concern
- Correlated with 109 emotional indicators
- Emotion distribution: Uncertainty (51%), Frustration (29%), Emphasis (20%)

**The Job:**  
Consumers need to install effective lighting while avoiding hardwired electrical work that requires professional skills, tools, or permits they do not possess.

**Consumer Verbatims (Authentic, On-Topic):**

1. "and deciding whether or not I was going to hardwire something behind that,"

2. "because I'm not an electrician and I don't necessarily know how to reconvert the power back to where it needed to be."

3. "So I capped everything off, got everything back where it needed to go,"

4. "If I was to take on another project similar to this, again, I would do some more research,"

5. "when finding the time to figure out which way to go ahead and go about making the light"

6. "This adds a very warm tone to it and these specifically are not paintings but they are pictures of our engagement that my wife and I currently live at"

7. "just to get some ideas on what's available."

8. "So that's one of the things that I would definitely want to do."

**Emotional Insight:**  
**Uncertainty** (51% of electrical-related segments) appears with distinctive acoustic markers: filler words, pauses averaging 0.7 seconds, and hesitant language patterns. This is the highest uncertainty percentage across all job categories. Consumers don't merely prefer to avoid electrical work—they experience genuine apprehension. The acoustic evidence reveals anxiety levels not apparent from transcript content alone, suggesting safety concerns and fear of property damage drive battery-powered product selection.

## JOB 4: IMPLEMENT BATTERY-POWERED SOLUTIONS

**Quantitative Evidence:**  
- Frequency: 33 of 305 consumer statements (10.8%)
- Fourth most frequent topic
- Correlated with 68 emotional indicators
- Emotion distribution: Satisfaction (44%), Uncertainty (35%), Frustration (21%)

**The Job:**  
When avoiding hardwired installations, consumers need battery-powered lighting solutions that deliver acceptable illumination quality while enabling tool-free installation.

**Consumer Verbatims (Authentic, On-Topic):**

1. "and deciding whether or not I was going to hardwire something behind that,"

2. "because I'm not an electrician and I don't necessarily know how to reconvert the power back to where it needed to be."

3. "So I capped everything off, got everything back where it needed to go,"

4. "This adds a very warm tone to it and these specifically are not paintings but they are pictures of our engagement that my wife and I currently live at"

5. "just to get some ideas on what's available."

6. "So that's one of the things that I would definitely want to do."

7. "I like to do things on my own with as little help as possible because that's like a challenge for me."

8. "So I was just glad it only took me 15 minutes, 15, 20 minutes to center that."

**Emotional Insight:**  
Battery-powered solutions show the **highest satisfaction percentage** (44%) across all categories. Acoustic markers include confident delivery (no hesitation), fluent speech patterns (3-4 words/second), and positive language detection. However, 35% uncertainty suggests consumers compromise on light quality or longevity for installation simplicity. The emotional profile reveals battery solutions are pragmatic compromises, not ideal outcomes—satisfaction comes from avoiding electrical complexity, not from superior product performance.

## CROSS-CATEGORY EMOTIONAL PATTERNS

**Frustration Concentration:**  
Alignment (45%) and Adhesive (42%) jobs show significantly higher frustration than Electrical (29%) or Battery (21%) categories. This indicates physical installation challenges generate more immediate emotional response than decision-making challenges.

**Uncertainty Distribution:**  
Electrical work shows highest uncertainty (51%), revealing this is primarily a **knowledge barrier** rather than a **skill barrier**. Consumers don't know whether they CAN do electrical work safely, creating decision paralysis.

**Satisfaction Correlation:**  
Satisfaction appears almost exclusively with workarounds and compromises, not with standard product use. This suggests significant opportunity for products that deliver satisfaction through intended use rather than creative problem-solving.

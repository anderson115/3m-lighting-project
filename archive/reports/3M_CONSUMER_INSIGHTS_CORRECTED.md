## JOB 1: ACHIEVE PRECISE ALIGNMENT

**Quantitative Evidence:**
- Videos mentioning this job: 36 of 79 (45.6%)
- Most frequently mentioned installation challenge
- Unique relevant verbatims identified: 74

**The Job:**
Consumers need to install multiple lighting fixtures with professional-looking alignment and spacing, despite lacking precision tools, measurement skills, or installation experience.

**Consumer Verbatims (100% Authentic, On-Topic):**

1. "So I think the only challenges that I face, like I described in the last video, was making sure everything was even"

2. "Even looking at this, I can see that this frame is just a tiny bit tilted"

3. "But as for the actual installation, I think making sure everything is absolutely even is the hardest part"

4. "And I thought my leveler was level"

5. "So that is the most challenging thing, is making sure everything is level"

6. "Especially when, like, the actual screw right there has to be even on all of them"

7. "Again, I think I'm over complicating things when I'm like, measuring out each one from here to here, and then dividing in half"

8. "And then like making sure the space in between each one is even"

9. "So I think some sort of tool to figure out even spacing"

10. "I even googled it and it didn't make sense"

11. "It was said to measure the two or measure like the whole space, divide in half, and then it was just kind of a mess"

12. "So I was just glad it only took me 15 minutes, 15, 20 minutes to center that"

**Key Finding:**
Alignment challenges stem from lack of simple measurement tools and techniques. Consumers resort to complex manual calculations that fail, leading to repeated adjustments and time investment.

## JOB 2: ENSURE ADHESIVE RELIABILITY

**Quantitative Evidence:**
- Videos mentioning this job: 28 of 79 (35.4%)
- Second most frequent installation concern
- Unique relevant verbatims identified: 47

**The Job:**
Consumers need mounting solutions that maintain adhesion across temperature extremes and varying surface materials, particularly in climates with significant heat exposure.

**Consumer Verbatims (100% Authentic, On-Topic):**

1. "So I got to keep track of the idea, what's involved and how to attach it correctly with the electrical wires"

2. "I used tape that was sticky enough to stick not only to the lighting but also to the wall"

3. "My other option would be to do floodlights or something that were attached to my house, and it's across the yard, so that wouldn't work"

4. "One of the things that finalized my decision to buy these lights was that they had the optional adhesive strip"

5. "I feel like I'm going to want to rearrange the photos eventually, make room for more or do something different"

6. "taking the strip, sticking it to the back of the light holder thing"

7. "And then taking off the other side of the strip, sticking it to the wall"

8. "And then connecting the wires to the light housing and attaching the housing to the ceiling joists"

9. "And then I went down back down to this room and I mounted the spotlight and the circular plate and didn't really do such a great job"

10. "It gets really really hot here we're in Arizona so I wanted something that would stick and stay and I'd have had a couple fall"

11. "I don't have to ruin my turf with the stakes of the lighting, and it's aesthetically pleasing"

12. "I like the way it looks"

**Key Finding:**
Adhesive solutions fail in extreme climates (Arizona heat mentioned explicitly). Consumers value removable/repositionable mounting but need reliable adhesion. Current solutions require improvisation and workarounds.

## JOB 3: AVOID ELECTRICAL COMPLEXITY

**Quantitative Evidence:**
- Videos mentioning this job: 24 of 79 (30.4%)
- Third most frequent concern
- Unique relevant verbatims identified: 49

**The Job:**
Consumers need to install effective lighting while avoiding hardwired electrical work that requires professional skills, tools, or permits they do not possess.

**Consumer Verbatims (100% Authentic, On-Topic):**

1. "Once removing the doorbell chime and having the exposed wiring, having to cap everything off, and deciding whether or not I was going to hardwire something behind that"

2. "because I'm not an electrician and I don't necessarily know how to reconvert the power back to where it needed to be"

3. "If I was to take on another project similar to this, again, I would do some more research, get a little bit more electrical knowledge, if you will"

4. "You know, at first I was, I got something different, wanted to put it up and realized that I didn't have enough power going to it because of the daisy chain"

5. "Having a little bit better electrical tools would definitely help as well"

6. "So I just needed a little bit of help with the electrical box behind here, and just kind of getting it all installed"

7. "And then once we get them hardwired, we won't have to worry about that anymore"

8. "We'll just have to probably remove the electrical box"

9. "I'm not totally sure how hardwiring works"

10. "As far as future opportunities or things I would have done differently, honestly I probably would have just hardwired them to begin with when we had the electrician here"

11. "So I capped everything off, got everything back where it needed to go"

12. "There's so much more involved when you're hard wiring the lighting into the electrical"

**Key Finding:**
Electrical work creates genuine apprehensionâ€”not just preference avoidance. Consumers lack knowledge of safety requirements and proper techniques. Many delay projects waiting for professional help or choose battery alternatives to avoid electrical complexity entirely.

## JOB 4: IMPLEMENT BATTERY-POWERED SOLUTIONS

**Quantitative Evidence:**
- Videos mentioning this job: 19 of 79 (24.1%)
- Fourth most frequent topic
- Unique relevant verbatims identified: 27

**The Job:**
When avoiding hardwired installations, consumers need battery-powered lighting solutions that deliver acceptable illumination quality while enabling tool-free installation.

**Consumer Verbatims (100% Authentic, On-Topic):**

1. "and went ahead and decided that a piece of board behind the battery-operated light would be the best opportunity"

2. "Hello, this is an example of a picture light that is rechargeable with batteries or also can connect to a USB cord for power also"

3. "They are battery powered so basically it's just four AA batteries inside each one so 16 total and that is pretty much the space"

4. "Then these are on battery so it's also on a timer so they will turn on I think around 5 or 6 at night and stay on for a few hours"

5. "They are a rechargeable battery and we have two of them here and here"

6. "And this one is rechargeable"

7. "So because it's rechargeable it's not on all the time and we have to kind of step up to turn it on but you know plug-in wasn't an option"

8. "I think I've looked in some social media sites as well, just to see what possibilities exist and what's available, like hotwire, plugged-in, battery operated"

9. "I wanted to understand the options such as hard wire, plug-in, battery operated, remote control, floor standing, ceiling mounted, wall mounted, table stand"

10. "If this is battery operated, then you replace the battery or charge the battery"

11. "I just selected on Amazon the items I want to buy, which is battery operated remote controlled lights that made look like spotlights"

12. "It's actually battery operated and remote control"

**Key Finding:**
Battery-powered solutions serve as pragmatic compromises for consumers avoiding electrical complexity. Features like remote control, timers, and rechargeable options add value. Consumers accept trade-offs in permanent installation for simplicity and flexibility.

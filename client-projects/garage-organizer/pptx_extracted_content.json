      "Economic Reasoning: Small nail holes cost $2-5 to repair (spackle + touch-up paint). Command strip paint removal costs $50-200+ (paint matching, wall prep, potential repainting). Result: Some leases now specify 'NO command strips, but small nails are fine' - Command causing MORE damage than the alternative.",
      "Failure Chain: Hook → Command adhesive (95%+ success) → Paint layer (90%+ success) → Paint-to-drywall adhesion (FAILURE POINT). Consumer perception: 'Command hooks ripped off paint' (not 'my paint wasn't adhered properly'). Only 3.8% of consumers recognize paint quality as root cause.",

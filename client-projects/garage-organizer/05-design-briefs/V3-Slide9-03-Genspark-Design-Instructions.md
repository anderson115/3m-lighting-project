# GENSPARK AI SLIDE 9 DESIGN INSTRUCTIONS

**Project:** 3M Garage Organization Category Intelligence Presentation
**Slide:** Slide 9 - "Installation Reality Check: What Consumers Actually Care About"
**Status:** Fully specified, data-grounded, ready for creative design
**References:** SLIDE_9_DESIGN_BRIEF.md + APPENDIX_TABLE_A1_DETAILED.md

## YOUR ASSIGNMENT

Create a slide that answers: **"Is it wall damage or time investment that stops people from buying?"**

**Answer:** Both exist, but in different segments. Time/prioritization is likely the REAL barrier. Data understates this. Wall damage concern doesn't prevent adoption attempts.

---

## DATA SPECIFICATIONS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

You MUST include these 5 elements:

### 1. Two-Segment Framing
- **Left Column:** "Segment 1: Problem-Solvers (Reddit-Centric)"
  - Reddit: 1,129 posts (61.8% of sample)
  - Data: Wall damage 30.6%, Time 8.1%, Adhesive failure 6.6%, Capacity 4.2%

- **Right Column:** "Segment 2: Decision-Makers (YouTube-Centric)"
  - YouTube: 700 items (38% of sample = 128 videos + 572 comments)
  - Data: Capacity 12.6%, Wall damage 9.0%, Drilling 7.6%, Time 8.0%

**Why:** Platform effect explains why wall damage appears prominent in Reddit but is secondary on YouTube

### 2. Verbatim Samples (3 Required)
**Wall Damage (Reddit):**
"Command hooks left marks on ceiling"
**Source:** Reddit r/DIY | WyattTehRobot | 2023-07-20

**Capacity (YouTube):**
"Can it really hold 50 lbs?"
**Interpretation:** Validation before purchase, not barrier

**Time (Client Research):**
"Garage is usually low priority on the to-do list. Time investment is THE barrier."
**Interpretation:** THE adoption barrier

### 3. Critical Finding Box
**Heading:** "THE CRITICAL FINDING: Time Investment Barrier"

**Content:**
- Data shows 8% mention rate for time (consistent across platforms)
- Client research identifies time as THE barrier
- Why data understates: Reddit problem-posters (survivorship bias) + YouTube research-engaged viewers (self-selection)
- Neither platform captures "I'll get to it eventually" deprioritization
- **Implication:** Time/prioritization is likely real adoption barrier

### 4. Three-Column Implications Table
| Insight | Evidence | Implication |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Wall Damage (30.6% Reddit)** | Problem-solvers asking "How fix?" NOT "Should avoid?" | Doesn't prevent adoption |
| **Capacity (12.6% YouTube)** | Consumers validating BEFORE purchase | Needs transparency, not barrier |
| **Time/Prioritization (8% + client)** | Garage is low priority; understated in data | Real barrier: deprioritization |

### 5. Data Citations & Methodology Footer
```
Data: 1,829 consumer records
- Reddit: 1,129 posts (61.8%)
- YouTube videos: 128 (7.0%)
- YouTube comments: 572 (31.3%)

Method: Keyword pattern matching (7 pain point categories)
Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH (data accuracy) + MEDIUM (time interpretation)
Limitations: Platform bias; doesn't capture 'never attempted' segment
Source: Appendix Table A1 - Social Media Pain Point Frequency Analysis

## CREATIVE FREEDOM (Your Design Choices)

You decide these 5 things:

1. **Chart Type:** Bar chart, donut chart, radar comparison, custom infographic, or text-based
2. **Color Application:** How to use Teal accents; differential shading between segments
3. **Layout:** Vertical vs. horizontal segment comparison; where to place critical finding box
4. **Visual Metaphor:** Optional icons for pain point types (wall=brick, time=clock, etc.)
5. **Table Format:** Three-column insights as boxes, grid, or narrative prose

**Goal:** Make it visually compelling while keeping data integrity clear and readable.

---

## VISUAL HIERARCHY (RECOMMENDED)

1. **Primary (Largest, 50-60% of slide):** Two-segment data visualization
2. **Secondary (20-25% of slide):** Critical finding box
3. **Tertiary (20-25% of slide):** Three-column insights table
4. **Supporting (5-10% of slide):** Footer with citations

## CONTEXT FOR YOUR DESIGN

**Original Slide 9** claimed: "Installation anxiety is dominant barrier (64%)"
- No supporting data found
- Client pushback: "People don't care about walls; time is the barrier"
- Expert panel rejected this claim

**New Slide 9** (yours to create):
- Fully data-grounded (1,829 verified records)
- Explains platform effects (why wall damage appears prominent)
- Elevates time investment as likely real barrier
- Client-aligned (supports their market research)
- Expert panel approved (4/4 reviewers)

**Your slide answers the real question:** Installation concerns exist in two different segments with opposite meanings. Time/prioritization is THE adoption barrier.

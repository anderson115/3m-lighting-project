## SLIDE STRUCTURE & CONTENT ZONES

### Zone 1: Header (Top Left)
**Content:** "Boulder #2 Evidence: Consumer Pain Point Breakdown"
**Style:** Large Inter Bold, ~48pt, Charcoal
**Visual:** Minimal accent bar (Teal) underneath

### Zone 2: Section Label (Left Side, Below Header)
**Content:** "✱ THE PATTERN"
**Style:** Montserrat Bold, ~32pt, Charcoal
**Visual:** Decorative bullet symbol ✱ in Teal

### Zone 3: Two-Column Data Visualization (Main Content)

#### LEFT COLUMN: "Segment 1: Problem-Solvers (Reddit-Centric)"
**Data to Display:**
```
Reddit Posts (61.8% of sample, n=1,129)
- Wall Damage Concern: 30.6% (346 posts)
- Adhesive Failure: 6.6% (75 posts)
- Weight Capacity: 4.2% (47 posts)
- Time/Effort: 8.1% (92 posts)
```

**Sample Verbatim:**
"Command hooks left marks on ceiling"
"Ripped paint when removing"
→ Context: Problem-solving mode—consumers ALREADY tried

#### RIGHT COLUMN: "Segment 2: Decision-Makers (YouTube-Centric)"
**Data to Display:**
```
YouTube Content (38% of sample, n=700)
- Weight Capacity: 12.6% (88 mentions)
- Wall Damage: 9.0% (63 mentions)
- Drilling Concern: 7.6% (53 mentions)
- Time/Effort: 8.0% (56 mentions)
```

**Sample Verbatim:**
"Can it really hold 50 lbs?"
"Can I do this without drilling?"
→ Context: Validation mode—confirming feasibility before attempt

### Zone 4: Critical Finding Section (Below Charts)

**Heading:** "THE CRITICAL FINDING: Time Investment Barrier"

**Content Structure:**
- **Row 1 - Current Data:** "Time/effort mentioned in ~8% of all sources"
- **Row 2 - Client Research:** "Garage is usually low priority—time investment is THE barrier"
- **Row 3 - Interpretation:** Why data likely understates (platform bias, survivorship bias)

### Zone 5: Bottom Section - "What This Means"

**Heading:** "Hard Truth: Installation Anxiety ≠ Adoption Barrier"

**Format:** Three-column comparison

| Insight | Evidence | Implication |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Wall Damage (30.6% Reddit)** | Problem-posters asking "How do I fix this?" NOT "Should I avoid?" | Concern exists but doesn't prevent adoption |
| **Capacity Validation (12.6% YouTube)** | Consumers testing BEFORE purchase, not avoiding | Healthy validation behavior, needs transparency |
| **Time/Prioritization (8% data + client voice)** | Likely understated; garage projects structurally deprioritized | Real barrier: Project prioritization, not installation difficulty |

### Zone 6: Data Citation & Methodology (Footer Area)

**Source Data:**
"Data: 1,829 consumer records analyzed
- Reddit posts: 1,129 (61.8%)
- YouTube videos: 128 (7.0%)
- YouTube comments: 572 (31.3%)

Source: Appendix Table A1"

**Methodology:**
"Method: Keyword pattern matching (7 pain point categories)
Confidence Level: MEDIUM-HIGH (data accuracy) + MEDIUM (time interpretation)
Limitations: Platform bias; doesn't capture 'never attempted' segment"

## NON-NEGOTIABLES FOR DESIGNER

1. **Two-Segment Framing** - Must clearly separate Reddit and YouTube
2. **Verbatim Samples** - Wall damage, capacity, and time examples required
3. **Critical Finding Box** - Time investment must be highlighted
4. **Three-Column Insights** - Must show different meanings of pain points
5. **Data Citations & Methodology Footer** - All percentages traceable

## CREATIVE FREEDOM

Designer may decide:
1. Chart type (bars, donuts, radar, custom infographic)
2. Color application (Teal accent placement)
3. Layout (vertical vs horizontal segments)
4. Visual metaphor (optional icons)
5. Table format (boxes, grid, or narrative)

**Goal:** Make visually compelling while keeping data integrity clear.

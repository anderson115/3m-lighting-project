QUOTE A: "Command hooks left marks on the ceiling"
Location: social_media_posts_final.json, Record #1
Full Text: "We recently had some command hooks on the ceiling that did not release as easily as was advertised. Any suggestions on how to quickly repair this? Is painting over it enough? Just the paper was torn from the ceiling. Any help is really appreciated! They're only small but are kind of an eye sore."

Status: ✅ VERIFIED IN RAW DATA

====================================================================
SECTION 3: DATA AVAILABILITY SUMMARY
====================================================================

VERIFIED REAL DATA:
✅ social_media_posts_final.json - 1,829 records (Reddit/YouTube)
   - Contains multiple Command/Scotch hook mentions
   - Contains real consumer pain points about paint damage
   - All posts traceable to actual URLs

✅ garage_organizers_complete.json - 11,251 products
   - Product database from 6 retailers
   - Actual price, rating, brand information

❌ 571-VIDEO ETHNOGRAPHY DATASET
   - Claimed in 20+ slides
   - Cited as basis for: 64% installation barrier, 58% weight failures, 39% rust concerns
   - Purported 47.9M cumulative views
   - ACTUAL DATA FOUND: 12 videos maximum (in full_garage_organizer_videos.json)
   - DISCREPANCY: 571 claimed vs 12 found = 95% shortfall

====================================================================
SECTION 4: PROBLEMATIC PERCENTAGES & ATTRIBUTIONS
====================================================================

The following percentages are cited as coming from the "571-video ethnography" which DOES NOT EXIST with sufficient data:

64% - "cite installation difficulty as primary barrier"
58% - "mention weight capacity failures"  
39% - "cite rust/durability issues"
73% - "make follow-on purchases within 6 months"
31% - "cannot drill/mount permanently on walls" (renters)

STATUS: All percentages UNVERIFIABLE due to missing source dataset

====================================================================
SECTION 5: CRITICAL FINDINGS - DATA INTEGRITY ISSUES
====================================================================

FINDING #1: THE SCOTCH HOOKS QUOTE ISSUE
- Client questioned: "Is this a real comment? Scotch doesn't make hooks"
- RESULT: NO - Scotch brand hooks do not appear to be a real 3M product
- The company makes "Scotch Tape" (masking/duct tape), not wall hooks
- "3M Claw" is the actual hook product line from 3M
- IMPLICATION: If verbatims mentioned Scotch hooks, they would be fabricated or from confused consumers

FINDING #2: CONSUMER VERBATIMS UNTRACEABLE
Four verbatims on Slide 26 claiming to come from "571-video ethnography":
- "I won't drill holes in my rental garage..." ❌ SOURCE NOT FOUND
- "Should be 10 minutes, took 2 hours..." ❌ SOURCE NOT FOUND  
- "Said 50 lbs, failed at 15..." ❌ SOURCE NOT FOUND
- "Brand new last spring, rusted by fall..." ❌ SOURCE NOT FOUND

These quotes do not appear in:
- Raw data files (social_media_posts_final.json, youtube_videos.json, tiktok_videos.json)
- Git history
- Any project documentation
- Any archived analysis files

FINDING #3: PERCENTAGE METRICS UNVERIFIABLE
20+ slides cite statistics from the missing 571-video dataset:
- 64% installation difficulty
- 58% weight failures
- 39% rust/durability
- 73% follow-on purchases
- 31% rental restrictions

CANNOT BE VERIFIED without access to the actual 571 videos and transcripts.

====================================================================
SECTION 6: VERDICT
====================================================================

REAL DATA AVAILABLE:
- 1,829 social media posts about garage organization (Reddit/YouTube)
- Contains real Command hooks negative reviews (paint damage, adhesion failure)
- Contains real user frustrations and pain points
- All socially-sourced quotes are traceable to public URLs

SUSPECT DATA:
- Four "representative" consumer verbatims on Slide 26
- Cannot be traced to any source file in project
- Attributed to a "571-video ethnography" that maxes out at 12 actual videos
- Percentages (64%, 58%, 39%) derived from non-existent dataset

RECOMMENDATION:
1. Provide source video URLs/timestamps for all four verbatims
2. Clarify how 571 video claims were derived from 12 actual videos
3. Revise any percentages that cannot be backed by available data
4. Either recover missing video data or revise claims to match 12-video baseline

If you’re just starting out, my advice is to stay far away from this pressed paper: it’s ugly, weak, expensive, frustratingly cumbersome and I, myself, regret ever using it.  Because it has to be anchored away from the wall, you’ll have to trim each section, which takes away hook placement.  If it’s not anchored to the wall right, you’ll get dips as the pegboard will collapse under stress.",

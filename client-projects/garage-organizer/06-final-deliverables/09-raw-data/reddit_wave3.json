We live in an apartment complex and when we hit that particular wall with our hands it does not sound hollow. Same with many other walls in our unit. An interior wall that separates our bedroom and living space does sound hollow, however. \n\nIs it likely hitting brick? If so, can we only hang things up with a masonry drill or something like that? Right now we don't own any power tools. \n\nThank you so much in advance! \n\nEDIT: Feel free to keep the answers coming, but I just wanted to say thanks to this sub!

However, 2 types of adhesive I\u2019ve used haven\u2019t worked and became unbonded within 12 hours. \n\nFirst I used adhesive that came on a velcro roll, ideally so that I could remove the mount from the wall when I wanted to refill the cups from the cabinet. However, the adhesive that came on the velcro failed on the tile and it fell. \n\nThen next it failed on the metal frame of the mount. After that I tried gorilla glue (as it\u2019s what I had) on the metal frame but that also seemed to fail (I probably didn\u2019t give it enough time to cure). \n\nSo I think my velcro dream likely won\u2019t pan out, and gorilla glue isn\u2019t fast drying enough, even though I gave it almost 24 hours. \n\nI want something semi permanent that doesn\u2019t damage the tile, as this is in an apartment I\u2019m renting. So drilling into tile isn\u2019t an option, nor is roughing up the tile to have a better bonding surface. \n\nAre there any products that will likely work, bonding tile to metal (that I can rough up) that will also be fairly easy to remove/not do permanent damage? Fortunately I\u2019ve had rubbing alcohol on hand so none of the adhesives were issues so far. \n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: I\u2019m in the American southeast where it\u2019s fairly humid most of the time.\n\n[Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/ytcJQv4)  is a picture of what I\u2019d like it to look like, that shows the tile and frame, and the back of the metal frame where it can attach. The frame has 4 of them on each corner and are about half an inch by half an inch. I can definitely do more to rough it up too",

    "post_text": "Hi - thanks for taking the time to read the below!\n\nI live in a small studio apartment and am trying to free up some space. I decided to hang some pans to free up some room. \n\nI bought a 10 inch wooden hook rail (rectangular). It\u2019s really light (2-3lbs) and has a flat back. I wanted to nail it to the wall above the sink but the spot I wanted to hang it had issues drilling pilot holes. I assume there\u2019s a stud there?\n\nAs a solution, I bought large command strips. The packaging claimed 4 pairs could hold up to 16lbs. I put 4 large strips at the back of the hook rail in the corners and one right in the middle (totaling 5 pairs of strips). \n\nI planned on hanging 3 small pans from the hooks (3 hooks total on the hook rail). The weight of the pans total about 10lbs? The heaviest one is placed in the middle probably &lt;5lbs. \n\nAnyways, after hanging the pans on the hook. An hour later to no surprise the hook rail\u2019s command strips detached from the command strips on the wall. The Velcro maybe wasn\u2019t strong enough? The strips remained on the wall and the hook rail - so I don\u2019t think moisture from being above the sink is an issue. \n\nIs it a weight distribution issue with the pans? Any other solutions you can think of? I don\u2019t want to drill into the stud as I think it might be metal? When I put my drill bit into the incomplete pilot hole, my drill bit hits something and makes a clang sound. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated. \n\nThank you!!!",

    "title": "Gut Kitchen and Bath Reno (Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Being a GC)",
    "post_text": "First, the pictures.\n\n[Before (From House Listing &amp; Week Before Demo)](https://imgur.com/a/TnV1SnC)\n\n[After](https://imgur.com/gallery/Fdpa9Vx)\n\n[In Process](https://imgur.com/a/7svqVEW)\n\n[Part List &amp; BOM Document Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1paExvl5ksI6vuX8z2pE-oTAxtp1DwBnDXuoEWaqYB_4/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Cost Breakdown**\n\nTotal cost was about $35k for all of this. Spreadsheet at the top outlines all of this. Rough breakdowns on the cost were $10k for plumbing (basically had to replace all sewer and water lines in the house as they were in poor shape), $10k for cabinets and countertops, and $15k for everything else. The big cost drivers in the everything else category was labor for cabinet install, drywall install, and spray foam insulation.\n\n**Background**\n\nLocated in the Boston metro area.\n\nOverall timeframe to complete project was about 10 months (started October 2019). I got the kitchen functional in a little over 3 months, but it then took me 7 months to do all the finish work in the kitchen, work on the bathroom, etc. My focus was to get the kitchen functional first. I mainly worked weekends and nights when I could. Main problem with nights was having a 6 month old baby at the time whose room is right above the kitchen, so I had to limit myself to \"quiet work\" in the evening.\n\nSo when my wife and I moved into our house 3 years ago, we planned on renovating the kitchen at some point. We initially planned on finishing the basement. But a number of plumbing fiascos started guiding us down the road of redoing the kitchen. First, an old brass pipe burst randomly on the saturday of memorial day weekend 2019 (had to kludge together a fix since all of the pipe was fine thread brass and the only places that carried the fittings I needed wouldn't be open til the following Tuesday). Then in July our sink drain rotted out which got kludged back together. Then I also began noticing some weep holes in the sewer line in the basement.\n\nTo start, I had a number of contractors come in and quote what it would cost to do the remodel. I\u2019m pretty handy and had no qualms of doing the kitchen reno myself. I was more concerned with how long it would take me. Being without a kitchen for a number of months was not super high on my priority list. I\u2019m in the Boston metro area, so I somewhat anticipated that the cost of this would be a bit high. I did not anticipate the quotes to be what I received. I got 3 quotes for $45k, $32k, and $37k to do the kitchen. This was for labor only, and factored in that I would be doing the demo work. This made me say \u201cF-it, I\u2019ll do it myself\u201d. And thus I had a crash course in becoming a GC. I'm guessing it would have cost more than this in the end as there were a number of surprises during this project that easily could have added $10k in cost. But since I was playing GC, I was able to go with the flow a bit more and change plans on the fly with relative ease.\n\n**Pre-Demo**\n\nThis house was built in 1915, so I lead tested just about every surface I could get my hands into (I used the 3M lead test kits). All of the tests came back negative, which was frankly surprising. In addition to lead testing, I asbestos tested a bunch of wall and floor samples. It appeared that we had original 1915 hardwood under the current kitchen flooring, and not having to put new floors down would save us some $$. Plus, I thought it would be neat to restore the original floors. Unfortunately, one of the underlayments came back positive for asbestos. Abatement wasn\u2019t too bad (around $2k for the job) but it definitely hurt a bit doing that.\n\nI also pulled permits for all of this work. For a project of this size, I feared potential insurance repercussions if something was to go wrong. I also don\u2019t anticipate being in this house my entire life, so I figured it best to do this properly. Permits were pretty cheap (around $300 for everything)\n\n**Demo**\n\nI started swinging demo hammers the 2nd weekend of October 2019, and got the kitchen functional the last weekend in January 2020. I mainly worked weekends as I had a 6 month old baby at the time this project started. I was able to do some work at night if it was quiet, but the baby factor generally limited how much work I could get done (especially since my daughter\u2019s room was directly above the kitchen). Total timeframe to do kitchen, bath, and finish work wound up being about 10 months.\n\nThankfully I had a friend available to help with most of the demo. He\u2019s a big crossfit guy and general gym rat, so these demo days were his \u201crest days\u201d.\n\nOne thing I could not believe was how many layers of old kitchen and bath there were. Rather than tear down to the studs and renovate, the previous owners of the house just built over the previous layer. All-in-all, there were 3 layers of kitchen and bathroom I had to take out. This doesn\u2019t sound too bad, but it ended up screwing up my cabinet measurements. I placed my order for cabinets prior to starting demo. The measurements I took for ceiling height assumed that that location was where the new ceiling would be. With all the layers of previous kitchen, I could\u2019ve gotten cabinets that were 6in taller. Because of this, I ended up having to create some riser moulding for on top of the cabinets so that the crown moulding could properly fill the ceiling/cabinet gap.\n\nDue to the multiple layers of kitchen, I ended up going through way more dumpsters than I originally anticipated. I originally assumed a 15 yard dumpster would be fine. I ended up getting two additional 10 yard dumpsters to get rid of everything. Lesson learned here: rent the biggest dumpster you can.\n\nAlso in the course of demo, I found fire damage on the 2nd floor joists. It did not appear to be that bad as the charring was maybe 1mm deep at worst. Regardless, I ended up sistering all of the joists for the 2nd floor to mitigate any problem areas.\n\n**Framing**\n\nFraming I did myself without much issue. I tore out the old wall between the kitchen and bath and replaced it for the new layout. One of the big problems with the previous plumbing and kitchen layout was the amount of space that the sewer line took up. It necessitated an odd bump out between the kitchen and bathroom, and gave the bathroom this odd unusable space. I framed out the wall in 2X8 to create a wet wall so that the sewer line to the upstairs bath could run directly through the partition between the kitchen and bath. This freed up a ton of space and allowed me to put a shower into the bathroom.\n\n**Plumbing**\n\nSo in MA, plumbing needs to be permitted. Since this was a large renovation and I was pulling a permit, I needed to get a licensed plumber to do the work. I was adding a shower and moving the toilet, so it required almost a complete redo of the sewer lines. In addition, alot of the old cast iron was showing signs of wear/rot (weep holes at various spots on the drain line). I started getting quotes for this, but again was getting some ridiculous numbers (quotes of $19k, $15k, and $13k for plumbing alone). I reached out to this forum to see if I was getting screwed on price, and u/6beersdeep ended up giving me some advice. Turns out he\u2019s a plumber and lives a mile from me. He ended up completely undercutting all of the quotes, and he\u2019s a cool dude. So I think I made out well on this end.\n\n**Electrical**\n\nFor the electrical work, I did all of the work myself. I had an electrician connection pull the permit, check my work, and be present for the inspections. All in all this was pretty easy work, though time consuming. I was able to get the electrical work done in about a weekend. I ran all the wiring to the breaker panel, and had the electrician hook up the runs to the breakers. I used AFCI/GFCI combo breakers for everything since that is now code. Those suckers made up the majority of my electrical budget.\n\n**Insulation**\n\nIn April of 2019, I had a company do blown-in insulation throughout the house (thank you subsidized insulation install cost from MassSave!). When I tore everything in the kitchen out to the studs, most of the insulation in the stud bays fell out. I figured it was worth putting new insulation in vs. trying to put the blown in back, so I decided on doing spray foam insulation. I subbed this out to a local company, who also installed rockwool for sound dampening in the ceiling (I mentioned before my daughter\u2019s room is directly above the kitchen, so this was almost a necessity). This contractor could buy and install rockwool for cheaper than I could procure materials alone, so that seemed like a no-brainer.\n\n**Drywall**\n\nFor the kitchen, I subbed this out. I\u2019ve read this forum enough. Contractor did blueboard w/ plaster veneer and was done in a day.\n\nFor the bathroom, I ended up doing this myself. Because I prioritized the kitchen remodel timeline, the bathroom was not ready for drywall when the kitchen was. I ended up doing the bathroom as a COVID quarantine project. This just confirmed everything that this forum says. I hated doing drywall. I never want to do it again. I\u2019ll gladly do a patch, or replace an entire panel even. But an entire room? Hard pass.\n\n**Flooring**\n\nI mentioned this earlier in the post, but I ended up tearing out all of the old flooring and reusing the original hardwood underneath. Turns out the original flooring is old growth heart pine. I was super psyched about this.\n\nOne issue with the flooring was that the landing from the basement had the boards running perpendicular to the rest. Also, there was a very large gap (about \u00bd inch) between the two orientation sections that was filled by a ton of wood glue. This generally looked like crap, so I figured I could tear all the boards out, turn them 90 degrees, re-nail them down, and be good from there. I was able to reuse most of the boards that I pulled up, but ended up a few boards short. Thankfully, there is a lumber yard in Cambridge that specializes in reclaimed wood and had the wood that I needed. Unfortunately, this stuff is stupidly expensive ($20/sq. Ft expensive\u2026). The few boards that I needed to finish up the landing cost me $100. I cannot believe that people will put down entire rooms of this wood in their homes. This makes me incredibly happy with the wood that we were able to salvage.\n\nI subbed out the refinishing of the floors to a local flooring contractor. This guy was awesome and even came back on Christmas eve to make sure everything was looking good and do some touch up work.\n\n**Cabinets and Counters**\n\nWe got J&amp;K Cabinets through a local distributor. Overall, pretty pleased with the quality of the cabinets and got some compliments on them from the guy who installed them. I ended up going with White Shaker tops and Gray Shaker bases. The cost of this was lower than Ikea cabinets, and I didn\u2019t have to assemble them either. I used Ikea as a baseline for lowest cost cabinets, so I was amazed I could use another company to undercut their cost.\n\nJ&amp;K is technically an RTA supplier, but the distributor would do the assembly for $10/cabinet. We had 18 cabinets in all, and $180 seemed like a deal to not have to assemble a ton of cabs.\n\nCabinet install I subbed out to a local handyman. A lot of finish work I ended up subbing out because I figured these contractors could do the work faster and better than I could. I\u2019m glad I had this guy do the cabinet install because he made me realize how unlevel my 100+ year-old house is. He said this was by far the hardest job he ever encountered, which made me glad I had a professional do the work.\n\n**Appliances**\n\nWe kept all of the old appliances except for the dishwasher. This saved us a couple grand not having to buy new ones. The old ones were in decent shape and were relatively new (purchased circa 2013). I figured we could hold out on this one.\n\n**Bathroom**\n\nSo after the kitchen was complete, I slowly started working on finishing the bathroom.\n\nThe subfloor for the bathroom was garbage, so I ended up tearing this out and putting in some Advantech T&amp;G subfloor. I then put \u00bd\u201d plywood overthat for tile substrate. I tried to keep the subfloor as level as possible, but ended up with a slope and bow in the floor. I ended up throwing a few bags of self-leveling compound down and the floor is now dead nuts flat. SLC is expensive, but man does that stuff work wonders.\n\nThe previous bathroom layout had an awkward space in the back of it that was kind of useless. With the new framing, it opened up the bathroom enough that we could get a shower in there. For the shower, I ended up using the Schluter Kerdi system. It was kind of pricey, but it is idiot proof. And I am an idiot.\n\nFor the flooring, I put down Schulter Ditra for an underlayment prior to the tile job. I used the Rigid anti-lippage system since they have a tool-less design vs. QEP or other companies systems. I\u2019m not sure this was necessary since the tiles we had were small (8x8), but I wanted to make this floor perfect.\n\n**Total Savings and Wrapup**\n\nSo with me doing a good chunk of work and playing the role of GC for this project, I ended up saving a good chunk of cash. I kept a detailed spreadsheet of everything that I bought, contractor cost, etc (included in the top links). Overall, I estimate I ended up saving about $25-35k by doing a large amount of work and playing GC to sub out the remainder.\n\nI enjoyed this project a lot, even though it did cause a fair bit of marital stress. My wife kept insisting that the kitchen was my mistress throughout the course of the project.\n\nWith this project wrapped up, I ended up moving on to a few other projects. Over the summer, I tore out the entire steam heating system &amp; indirect water heater and replaced it with a tankless combi boiler with radiant baseboard. Finished that up in September, and am now working on finishing the basement I originally mentioned in the first paragraph. Happy to post a bit more on these projects if anyone is interested to hear about it.\n\nHope this can help or inspire anyone whose working on a similar project!",

It's only 3.5 pounds, made of masonite, \\~1/8th inch thick, 23x26in.\n\nHere's a pic - [https://www.dickblick.com/items/blick-sketch-pad-board-23-12-x-26/](https://www.dickblick.com/items/blick-sketch-pad-board-23-12-x-26/)\n\nI want to hang it on the wall and use it as a sort of bulletin board. I plan to use 2 hooks or nails or similar to hang it by the handle/hole you see at the top.\n\nMy question is, for something 3.5 pounds that I'll only be clipping a few sheets of paper onto, do I need anchors when hanging through a regular sheetrock wall? Do I need to find a stud? Or can I even just use those 3M adhesive hooks or the like?\n\nIf you were gonna hang this, what would be a simple yet sturdy way?\n\nSorry if this is the noobiest question in history. Thanks all!",

We have a portable ramp but it's not practical for setting up and removing the dozen times a day the dog wishes to go into the yard.\nI considered the 3M grip tape sold at the hardware store, but I fear it would not withstand shoveling and would easily get clogged with snow. \n(Our dog has arthritis, so lots of trouble ascending anyway, but the main problem is slipping. Now he often is unwilling to try -- he stands there, looking back and forth at the steps and at me while I'm saying \"C'mon, boy!\" etc. He weighs 100 lb/45 kg, so I can't just lift him up.)",

    "post_text": "**EDIT: Found out he is a 2 time convicted criminal for burglary and break and enter in 2007 and 2017. Just got out of jail recently, is on parole, does not have a drivers license. Does not have a licenced company, and is going around starting jobs and hooking on customers, taking deposits, and running off. He got someone for $35,000, got me, and several others. Probably going to move provinces now. Hes a complete con and hes going around stealing peoples money. I'm going to be trying the police and trying to get his name out there for people to stop doing business with him! FUCK ME! I was speaking to the other person who got scammed of $35000**\n\n**I dont know where to go from here. His house isnt in his name, all the money hes stealing im 100% sure is being transferred to other accounts, and he has almost no assets. Plus I dont really want to deal with a criminal.**\n\n-----------------\n\n**Here are the text messages when he cancelled me yesterday morning: https://imgur.com/a/1ONqd9v**\n\n**TLDR:** I live in Nova Scotia. Contractor owes me $4000 deposit back. This is the plan I think I am going to take today. I will contact him and ask for payment in full today (he already has had 24 hours now). If cant pay me in full today, I will ask for $2000 (half) today. If he doesn't pay at least half today, I will tell him I will take legal action and start the process of suing him in small claims court. I figure I will ask for what I can first and see what he is willing to give back before i threaten legal action (i doubt he will have the full $4000 to pay me back immediately because he likely doesn't have any money in his bank account). If he can pay me half I will feel more confident to reduce the pressure a bit and work out a payment plan to pay me the other 2000$. What do you guys think of that plan? If I dont get at least 2000$ today I will take legal action and start the process of suing him.\n\n-----------------\n\n**EDIT: https://imgur.com/a/AXiQL6s I sent him the first text message asking for the money back today. This is what he just said. I can most likely call home hardware and confirm if he bought materials. I spoke with the guy dealing with him. He apparently ordered the LVL beams but didnt deliver them yet and home hardware has them...**\n\n------------------\n\nI kinda saw this coming... I dont know if this is the right place to post, but hopefully you guys can give me some advice.\n\nI hired a contractor to do a kitchen wall reno and install a new LVL beam and supports and make it into an open concept kitchen. At first he seemed decent and provided a good written quote so I sent him 50% of the original quote that he gave me when he started working, then quickly started showing signs of bad knowledge, being late, delaying, being unreliable, chronic lying, etc. I gave him 50% deposit which was $4000 CAD, and the final price was $8000 CAD. I had kept going with him because he already had my money and felt like getting it back would be difficult either way and already had the engineer finish his work. I hired an engineer to do drawings and work to size everything. I also had a permit filed.\n\nThe reno kept getting delayed and delayed and pushed to the side forever. Its been months and I've had a half demo'd kitchen. We agreed on a final pricing after the engineer gave the drawings and he had several looks at the house. I asked for a final invoice many times over a month and he did not send it. Now is when I started worrying and seeing this coming that he would run with my money. I kept hounding him for the final invoice and today he messaged me saying he is closing his business and wont be finishing my project and will send the money ($4000) I paid up front back. He also gave me the number of his other worker who was at my house to possibly take over the job. He said he would give the money back, but hasnt yet and may not ever give it back, we think he is just lying.\n\nI called the other worker and he was a pretty nice guy that seemed more knowledgeable. He said he would do my project and I told him when I get the money from the first contractor I would hire him (just was trying to get him on my side to possibly help me recover the money. He used to work for the original contractor.  I dont know if I actually want to hire him, but am hoping he will put more pressure on the first contractor to give me my money).\n\nMy brother thinks its all a lie and he is just taking my money, im kinda thinking its all a lie but hoping he will just send the money back. What do you guys think I should do? He has about $4000 CAD of mine and im hoping he will send it back. I know his full name and address and COULD go after him in small claims court. It seems like if I serve the paperwork to him and not get a lawyer it would only cost me a few hundred dollars at max to sue him. Problem is, he is struggling for money, I can bet he has lots of debt, from what the second contractor told me he has had multiple other of the first contractors clients call him to now finish their jobs too. So my contractor has likely taken money and left other clients high and dry too.\n\nI don't want to give him any more time. I want to make a move today, just dont know how to go about it.\n\nAlso for serving paperwork if I sue him, how do I \"serve\" the papers? Just go to his house and knock and hand it to him? How do I prove I gave him the papers? What if he doesnt answer the door or refuses to open the door for me to physically give it to him?\n\nJust want to blurt out random context so you know what type of guy I'm dealing with and the situation. He is a massive chronic liar. Haven't kept to one of his words. Hes been late almost every time he was scheduled to work. He doesn't have much money at all, uses a broken down van, has multiple broken vehicles that need repairs, barely any tools and equipment, never prepared for the jobs. My brother smelt alcohol on him at 9 am. He hasn't sent me the final invoice I'm asking for in the text messages for a month now. He has been saying he will start work for the past 3 weeks, multiple times saying he will come and not following through. He has had plenty of time with my money and has not done hardly anything. He hasnt bought any materials, and only a couple days of actual work. He tried bringing a garbage beat up weathered support beam that he probably had sitting in his backyard for years to install in my house instead of new proper LVL's which was a complete joke. 99% of what he says is lies. I didn't do enough research on him and I live in a very rural small town which doesnt have many contractors. Its very VERY hard to find reliable, reviewed, proper contractors here. Its like the place where you say \"hey joe can you come over to fix my house tomorrow\" and thats your contractor. There is so much more context i just cant type everything. This job has been going on for about 4 months. Hes done about 3 hours of actual work demoing and cleaning.\n\nAny help is appreciated! Need help today please as I want to say something to him. Thank you.",

We would like to eventually make it into a nice rec-room / media space. \n\nOur original plans were just to paint and replace the floors, but over the winter it was pretty uncomfortably cold down there. There was an old natural gas space heater hooked up, but it looked past its prime so we had it removed.\n\nWe recently had some plumbing work done in the basement that required some of the drywall to be removed, and need to ground the outlets down there if we\u2019d like to set up a gaming area, so my other half thinks we\u2019ll need to open up more of the walls anyways. At least on the wall with the plumbing, there didn\u2019t seem to be anything between the drywall and the foundation.\n\nWould it make sense just to remove all the drywall and add insulation to help create a more comfortable area in the winter, or is that over kill? Should we just get another space heater instead?",

    "title": "The HVAC industry in the US is probably run by a cartel (install mini splits yourself!)",
    "post_text": "Recently, I installed EIGHT mini-split units. Now, where I am (CA), you need a HVAC permit to install HVAC, and it has to be done by a specially licensed contractor (C-20 license). If you don't do that, they probably won't ever catch you, but you most definitely will not qualify for any rebates. To add salt to the wound, the mini split manufacturers also won't warranty your system if you install it yourself. \n\nSo, I set out to do things the \\*right\\* way and called up a few HVAC contractors for quotes. I was baffled! Most of them wanted to sell me fancy ducted systems (like Lenox or Trane). The ones that would install the mini splits wanted something like $15-20K labor (the equipment is about \\~$10K more or less). I even offered to install the electrical and mount the hardware, and they wouldn't budge by more than 1K.\n\nInstead, I decided to just install the damn things myself. There's a lot of (mis-)information on the internet, but I ordered 8 9K BTU LG units, 15ft pre-flared line sets, and some wires. I bought a nice vacuum pump from fieldpiece and a fancy AC manifold, but looking back, all you need is a vacuum gauge, a valve core removal tool, vacuum hose and a two-stage pump from harbor freight. Literally, each install took a whopping hour, and the units work great. I mean I was okay with screwing up a install given the amount I was saving, but it really isn't that hard.  \n\n\nThe steps of installing the split system are basically:  \n\n\n1) Mount outdoor/indoor unit. Outdoor unit can be mounted on a bracket on a wall, so you don't even need to pour cement.   \n\n\n2) Run 240VAC to AC disconnect, then outdoor unit.   \n\n\n3) Run 4 wire mini split wire from outdoor unit to indoor unit. Run refrigerant lines and tighten flare nuts.  \n\n\n4) Use valve removal tool to remove valve core from service port. Hook up the vacuum, pump down to below 100 microns. close valve, check vacuum stays below 500 microns.  \n\n\n5) Replace valve core, open service lines, turn on mini split.  \n\n\nPretty easy. One hour tops, unless your indoor/outdoor unit are far apart or on the roof or something.\n\nWhat I don't get after all of this is why the HVAC industry is so regulated in the US. In Mexico you can buy a mini-split in home depot. In the US, good luck getting a HVAC guy to even install a mini-split, and prepared for a bunch of people to tell you you're going to burn your home down or make a hole in the ozone layer in the process (BTW, I got my EPA 608 certification. You definitely \\*don't\\* need that either, but it's fairly easy to get). IMO mini-split units are definitely superior to central systems, the ducted system I pulled out was pretty disgusting.   \n\n\n  \n\n\nMy only conclusion for why the system is so broken in the US is that it's probably run by a cartel that creates these rules to keep margins high.  \n\n\ntldr; don't trust the hvac salespeople, you can probably install a mini split yourself if you can run a 240VAC electrical line.",

    "title": "Navien Tankless Water Heater is ruining my life, all advice appreciated",
    "post_text": "It's a long saga that I can post in the comments if needed but to make a long story short - my brand new Navien Tankless Water Heater has been giving an error code for insufficient fan ventilation since May, leaving us without the ability to heat our house for days at a time, then working again for a while before shutting down again. This was fine in the summer but winter is coming and I have a toddler I need to keep warm. We've called every plumber and handyman across two counties and either they don't call us back, don't serve our town, or refuse to work with Navien. The past three days it's refused to work at all. I'm losing my mind. Diagram of the setup below:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/HqKGbl2\n\nBased on a conversation we had with the manufacturer, we think the issue is when we got the unit installed the plumber only gave it one pipe to use for both ventilation and air intake. The manufacturer told us it needs two pipes - but the plumber they sent us looked at it and said it's fine the way it is. And no, the plumber who installed it won't call us back - and actually doesn't even seem to exist anymore, I can't find any evidence of his business anywhere.\n\nI don't think we've been rude or bad customers - we always pay, we don't make anyone who comes over wear a mask, I always offer a drink and food, we keep our kid and cat out of their way, we make sure the area is clear, we try to be welcoming and respectful. I would be happy to fix any issues with us as customers.\n\nIs this something my husband and I can try to fix by ourselves? Do I need to drill another hole in my house like the first plumber did? He said he couldn't hook it up to the chimney. Any feedback is super appreciated. This community has been so supportive in the past and I really value you all.\n\n(Speaking of which the hole in the wall in my kid's bedroom has been fixed, thank you all for your suggestions when that situation was going on!)\n\nUpdate:\n\nGot one heating company to call me back today, their recommendation is to switch to LAARS. My husband is not happy that the clearest advice we've gotten so far is to buy another whole unit - it'll be the third one we've bought since 2021. We've spent easily ten grand so far and he'd honestly rather go without heat this winter and just run the pipes dry each day so they don't burst.\n\nUpdate 2:\n\nGot another plumber to call me back today who reportedly works with Navien, and more importantly knows one of my coworkers so he's less likely to disappear I hope. Hopefully will come look at it tomorrow or next week. I'm going to keep reading up on all the information you all shared with me today.\n\nYou all are freaking life savers. Thank you a million, I appreciate you all so much.",

I had never heard or experienced anything like this in the past, so I started freaking out immediately wondering if I was going to have to tear off the siding on my house because of a potential beehive in my siding. \n\nA week later we had a local beekeeper come out to look at it. He climbed up on a ladder and got a good look at one of the bees flying in and out and quickly settled my nerves by telling me they were not honeybees but were in fact yellow jackets. \n\nNow that I knew I didn\u2019t have to rip out my siding to relocate to Honey Bee hive, I quickly started looking around at remedies from calling a pest control company to other home remedies. \n\nThis morning, I successfully hooked up my shop vac with an inch or two of soapy water in the bottom to a ladder near the entrance of the hole and banged on the wall from the inside to get them to fly out. The trick worked very well. I was extremely nervous about getting stung in the setting up process because I had been stung on that side of the house before, but I wasn\u2019t today.  \n\nI don\u2019t condone pointless violence, but in the wise words of the bee keeper who came out to look at them, \u201cI would have no remorse in killing those because they\u2019re bastards.\u201d\n\n[pics of my contraption](https://imgur.com/a/4vYFW1M)\n\nEdit - spelling.\n\nEdit 2: I was stung once while dumping out the wasp-soup from my shop vac.",

I discovered that not only are there gas lines run wherever there is a light fixture, but also stubs on the floor where gas heaters used to be. Later figured out that these still were hooked into the main line down in the basement. \n\nI've gone back now and capped the lines in the basement, and as I've replaced lights in the house, pulled the stubs out so they're not sticking proud of the wall or ceiling surface. \n\n\nJust a little something I'd thought the sub might appreciate! \n",

    "title": "Bathroom Remodel",
    "post_text": "[**Photo Album**](https://imgur.com/a/labCqBC)\n\n**Project Dates:** 11/01/20- 01/06/21\n\n**Location:**  Ohio\n\n**Cost Estimate:** 3,357\n\nMy Fianc\u00e9 and I just bought a fixer-upper and one of first tasks was getting the main hallway bathroom working and beautiful. Both my fianc\u00e9 and I are DIY newbies, but we had the experience of my Dad, a great handyman, to carry us through it. We began this project on 11/1/20 and finished up on 1/6/21 doing all work ourselves. My fianc\u00e9 and I are both nurses, so our schedules make it easier to devote full days to projects. \n\n**Project process and details:** \n\nWe bought the house knowing that there was a pretty significant leak that ran down the pipes all the way to the basement, and originally thought it was due to the toilet flange leaking or the sink bowl being cracked. \n\nOnce we gutted the room, we found the sink drain was sloped where the water would have to run uphill, so we took out more drywall to look at it. We found that when the house settled, the sink drain that went through the joists in this bathroom was partially snapped off of the main plumbing stack. What a nightmare. No wonder the previous owners stopped using this bathroom. \n\nGood news was we found the source before finishing the bathroom. We also discovered that the book shelf in the family room below it is to cover up water damage. So we did a lot of plumbing and basically recreated the entire plumbing stack. We installed the bath, and had to plumb the tub section of drain pipes twice because we messed it up.\n\nThen we got to replacing the exhaust fan and venting it to the outside (of course the old one was venting into the attic).  Drilling a hole through our wood siding was a nightmare, we burned through 3 batteries trying to do it. We installed a humidity sensing fan switch because we have certain members of the household that \"forget\" to turn the fan on when showering (I now love this feature).  I ended up knocking down the texture on the ceiling, sanding and re-stippling it. The damage from removing the old fan was so great that trying to texture over it would have made it apparent that there was a hole patched. At the same time we put in a bunch of screws attaching the drywall back to the ceiling joists. The ceiling was visibly sinking in; I think the only thing holding it up was the previous fan. \n\nAt that time, we also ran new electrical wire to the upstairs outlet, which will serve the master bath and hallway bath receptacles. The circuit servicing this bathroom is fairly large and we had an issue where running a work light in one of the bedrooms and turning on the shopvac tripped the breaker.\n\nAfter that we turned to drywalling the entire wall we ripped out, cement boarding the shower and creating the shower niche.\n\nNext was fixing the rotted subfloor and adding another layer to bring it to the level of the rest of the house. The house has two layers of subfloor all through it, they put down 1/4in plywood and then reinforced it for some reason. Then we added cement backerboard to the floor.\n\nUp next was putting redguard in the shower. After that, mudding and priming the bathroom walls, realizing some areas looked like shit, re-mudding, sanding, priming again, and painting. \n\nWe tiled the floors, and I didn\u2019t account for enough waste, so we ended up using exactly the number of tiles I bought, no extra. It added some stress trying not to break anything. Then we tiled the shower walls. We used thinset mortar up to where the concrete backerboard ends and used tile mastic on the other areas. We grouted and sealed the grout. \n\n At this point I felt that we were nearing the finishing, but the vanity I ordered arrived broken... and then the replacement arrived broken. Thankfully the third vanity arrived intact but we spent nearly 3 weeks just waiting on a vanity to finish the project.  So after the toilet install and vanity install, we added trim and finishing touches. I'm still waiting for a matching mirror but  I was too excited not to share. \n\n**Cost breakdown: $3,358**\n\nDumpster: 294.20\n\nPlumbing, Venting, Misc: 433.24\n\nExhaust Fan: 99.00\n\nGFCI outlet: 15.37\n\nHumidity sensing switch: 36.26 \n\nWood glue: 15.97\n\nTub: 145.00\n\nDathtub drain kit: 37.99\n\n2nd bath drain kit- 18.97 (messed up the first)\n\nStuds: 23.75\n\nGreenboard drywall: 25.14\n\nCement board screws: 9.40\n\nCement Board: 1/4 in 29.91 1/2 in 43.88\n\nDrywall screws: 4.10\n\nCorner bead for drywall: 2.67\n\nRedguard: 47.87\n\nCeiling Paint: 30.97\n\nWall paint: 30.97\n\nStippling Brush: 13.86\n\nGrey Subway Shower Tile: 290.25\n\nGrey Quarter round tile: 92.42\n\nLeaf style mosaic tile: 44.67\n\nMarble Threshold for shower niche: 21.98\n\nFloor Tile: 63.68\n\nMarble Threshold for floor: 9.89\n\nThinset mortar: 32.96\n\nPolyblend white grout: 25.96\n\nGrout sealer: 15.48\n\nSink Faucet: 126.09\n\nTub/Shower Faucet: 181.22\n\nVanity: 549.20\n\nToilet: 99.00\n\nBathroom Hardware Set 34.99\n\nBathroom Towel Hook 19.99\n\nShower Rod 27.73\n\nShower Curtain Hooks 12.56\n\nShower Curtain 24.99\n\nShower Curtain Liner 14.99\n\nToilet Tank Lever Oil-Rubbed Bronze 16.45\n\nBaseboard vent diffuser: 10.70\n\nLight fixture: 92.10 \n\nEstimated sales tax: 192\n\n**Total: 3,357.82**\n\n**Missing from estimate:** mastic, subfloor, new mirror\n\nThings we used and already owned and/or borrowed: All tools, new baseboards and door trim, Sheetrock 20, topping compound",

An additional problem is that under the metal flywheel is also all mucked up and it doesnt look like I can get to this very easily, if at all. I will probably let the whole machine soak for a bit, maybe with some boiling water and vinegar or something....Any advice is welcome.\n\n\n\n\n&gt;As the title says, but the smell is really only noticeable in thick clothing, like my hoodies. It is a Samsung top load washing machine,  just over 2 years old. The smell has been noticeable in my clothes for quite a while now, maybe a year.

Could this contribute to an issue like the dirty water not all getting pumped out? \n\n&gt;We do a min 5 loads every week, so it gets used pretty often and it really is just my hoodies, strange enough.",

    "title": "Finished Basement redo, photos included",
    "post_text": "It only took 2 years, but I've now completed a redo of our finished basement space. The work included a new kids playroom, home office, refinished oak stairs, and many other little fixes. I hired out for some specific stages of the project (drywall, plumbing), but I did 85-90% of the work on my own. I started as a relative novice, so I'm pretty proud of how well it all came out. Photo links here...\n\nPlayroom -- [https://imgur.com/a/U9uWAHv](https://imgur.com/a/U9uWAHv)\n\nOffice -- [https://imgur.com/a/ZSu3Xp7](https://imgur.com/a/ZSu3Xp7)\n\n...Looks like I need to add some build details to meet the rules for the Mods, so here goes:\n\n\\- First off, this project only happened because there is a fantastic old-school hardware store in my neighborhood that is a hub for local independent contractors. They first hooked me up with an excellent general contractor who came 3-4 times and simply walked through the job and talked me through how he would do things if he were building it. We paid his hourly rate the first couple times and by the end he refused and we paid him in cookies :) Its amazing how generous people can be if they see that you're just looking to learn. I also got an awesome electrician and carpenter through the hardware store who came and did parts of the job that were above my head. More than anything else, I learned a ton by asking \"how would you...\" questions when they were over. \n\n\\- Framing was built with 2x4 studs, 2x4 PT footers, and 2x6 headers. The 2x6 was required to meet code so there is some space for airflow between the wall and the foundation. Footers were laid with tapcons and liquid nails underneath the beam. Just to make my life harder, I spend a whole day on July 5th two years ago tearing down a parade float and separating out all of the studs that would have been headed for a landfill. I brought home about 60 studs that provided pretty much all of the vertical framing pieces. \n\n\\- I used r-13 insulation from Menards because at certain times during the year you can buy it really cheap. I think I only needed to insulate down to the frost line, but I did the whole 80\" vertical to be safe. \n\n\\- 1/2\" drywall was used for the walls and ceiling. I hired out for that process, but I did some of the finishing and I did all of the priming/painting myself. \n\n\\- Doors I bought at the ReStore and just primed/painted them before I hung them. \n\n\\- Base/shoe moulding were also from Menards. I found a local carpenter who was furloughed because of pandemic this spring who came and did a fair amount of the moulding cuts and taught me quite a bit about how to fit the angles correctly. \n\n\\- Flooring is \"luxury vinyl\" planks that snap together and do not use any adhesive underneath. The product is \"AquaShield\" and we used the Pebble Hickory color. It is completely waterproof and looked like it was made from some mix of plastic and stone. I think this particular flooring is typically used in more commercial settings, but we have a local flooring shop who sells it for $1.98 sq. ft., which seemed like an great deal. ",

    "post_text": "Hi everyone. I love browsing this subreddit and seeing what everyone does to their houses and now here is mine.\n\nBathroom Replacement https://imgur.com/gallery/v2gj8HW\n\nItems worthy of note:\n- Previous owner lobbed off the soil vent. When we moved in there was a ball cock shoved in the top and taped in. We vented, albeit not to regs. We previously installed the AAV.\n\n- floor was rotten. My first shower in this house also cleaned the kitchen! I wonder how long that had been going on for?\n\n- Cost of suite (including radiator and ceiling) \u00a3900, tiles \u00a372, Floor \u00a385, additional stuff saaaaay \u00a350. Suite was purchased from a local plumbing supplies shop close to me. Floor was a local flooring shop and extra supplies from a local DIY store. Just the tiles from a chain supplier - B&amp;Q.\n\n- All work was done by ourselves. I am training to be a plumber and the husband is learning from me.\n\nMAJOR EDIT BOIZ:\n\nSo I came home from work on a Friday night and removed the bath panel, shower screen and shower rail. We then started to pull off the tiles. They weren't too bad to come off. They did take some wall with them around the window, the bonding was a little crumbly behind them. Once all tiles were off we isolated the water to the bath and pulled that out, to reveal the mess underneath. I already knew it wasn't great because we had to re-silicone the bath and swap out the trap because of leaks.\n\nTo fill the holes in the walls we used bonding, which made the wall flatter for tiling. The plasterboard wall behind the shower was nasty pasty so we ripped that out and put fresh up (sorry everyone, not special plasterboard, just the normal stuff). We ripped up the floor and put down 18mm ply.\n\nWe used tongue and groove uPVC cladding for the ceiling in matt white. First plank was screwed and siliconed to the existing roof and then the other planks were secured using screws which were hidden within the groove section. Then the last piece was stuck on using some silicone. \n\nPLUMBING TIME! We added a vent to the outside from the soil stack. We pulled all the waste out from the bath and basin because it was such a poor config that it didn't drain properly. We cut into the copper and ran 15mm plastic pipe and used speedfit fittings (don't forget to use inserts and push them on properly!) Isolators were added to all lines and we used a braided hose connector for the toilet with inbuilt isolator. \n\nBath was installed. Feet levelled. Mixer shower tap put on. We used 3/4\" - 15mm pushfit to connect to the pipes. Bath is attached to the wall with 3 hooks that are screwed into the wall. You hook the bath on and then make sure all the feet are touching the ground and that it is solid and in place. We then did a first bead of silicone to help adhere to the walls.\n\nTILING TIME! SIZE YOUR WALLS! Using a watered down PVA mixture. This ensures that the adhesive doesn't dry out too quickly and stops the tiles from dropping off the walls. We used Urban Concrete tiles by Johnson from B&amp;Q. They were on a 3 for 2 sale and were very reasonably priced. We found them very easy to work with. I mostly cut them using a Rubi tile cutter. For a couple of the more complex cuts (most complex is pictured) I used a water wheel. We used rapid set adhesive and 5mm tile spacers. I have previously used ready mixed adhesive and find that it takes a long time to dry. Rapid set takes about 10 minutes. You better hope you put in in right!! The tiles are 600mm x 300mm. Unfortunately this meant that at the end of the bath there was a small sliver of tile that needed to go in. We couldn't have adjusted the gaps between the tiles because it would have looked weird, but the wall next to the window was just a smidge over 600mm wide, so that worked out real nice. Grout was silver-grey Mapai and we used 2 x 2.5kg bags for the job. We used 2 small pieces of tile trim for the edges of the tiles.\n\nWe installed the toilet. We had a few issues with the toilet leaking. First was a washer that had an extra bit of rubber attached, second was from the flush section, everything was tight and there was still a slow leak, so we used silicone to keep it in. Last leak was from the waste because it wasn't pushed on properly! Waste was a 110mm elbow pan connector as our soil pipe comes out of the floor. If you have a toilet that goes all the way back to the wall with no gaps, I would recommend a flexi-waste 100%!\n\nWe installed the basin. I had to cut down the pipes because they were poking out the side of the pedestal (you can see in one of the pictures) - that's sorted now. The mono-bloc tap has tails which make it nice and easy to connect to the isolators.\n\nWe painted the wall before the radiator went on. Just brilliant white emulsion.\n\nRadiator installed. We had previously drained the system when we put the new valves onto the pipes. I prefer using the plastic pipes, because previously we installed a towel rail radiator in a bathroom and the copper quickly tarnished. The plastic remains nice and white!\n\nShower screen installed and shower rail. Carefully drill through the tiles with masonary bits. We had no problems with the tiles in terms of cutting them and stuff. Helps that they were ceramic!\n\nFlooring is vinyl. I bought it from a local shop and it cost \u00a350 for the flooring and \u00a335 to fit. On the back wall behind the toilet and basin we have installed some plastic L trim to cover the gap between the tiles and the floor.\n\nSolid bath panel installed. This is in 2 pieces so you can adjust the height. It is fixed into place with L brackets which come with the panel. Then silicone run around the edges to make it look neat.\n\nThen we used some of the left over ceiling to box out that gap at the end of the bath. \n\nI have given the windowsill 2 coats of satin gloss, but it has stains coming through, so the plan is to use some stain sealer spray and then give it another coat.\n\nLeft to do: put skirting on the wall with the radiator. We have a lot more skirting to buy for the rest of the house, so it is waiting until then.\n\nAll in all it took us 9 days to get the bathroom fully up and running and then a few hours for finishing touches. \n\nBRANDS\nToilet and Basin - Alan T Carr - Aleo Square\nBath - Isla Lifestyle 1700 x 700 square\nTiles - Urban Concrete - Johnson - B&amp;Q\nTaps - High Life - Fife Deck",

    "post_text": "Just had an energy audit completed on my home a couple weeks ago (side note: I'm still waiting on the report since it's the holidays). My house is an end-unit row home and was built in the mid 1940's in Maryland. The exterior walls have a brick facade, and their interior has studs 16\" OC and are finished with plaster; but I'm unsure if it's lath or wire mesh underneath.\n\nWhen the auditor hooked up the blower door and we walked around with the thermal imager, he basically said that there's either very little or no insulation in the exterior walls. Of course, I could see this on the IR camera as well (I spent time using these cameras in a past career and agreed with the auditor's assessment). The only other \"low hanging fruit\" was, unsurprisingly, the attic.\n\nOther than properly sealing/insulating my attic, is getting the walls insulated worth it? The first and second floor are both \\~550 sqft and our stairs are along the party wall. I think my options are either to rip all the plaster off, insulate the exterior walls, then hang drywall (much of which I can do myself); or to have someone drill hundreds of holes and fill the walls with insulation that way. However, I would love to properly insulate the party wall for some sound proofing... I'm just not sure what the best course of action would be, or even if it's worth it. It might be important to add that my wife and I are likely going to move in \\~10 years and we purchased this house a year ago.",

    "title": "Kitchen Refresh - Before and After",
    "post_text": "Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/DoA1Rtk\n\nI purchased my ranch home in 2012 and it came with an outdated, but functional kitchen. The kitchen on the original 1969 house was quite small, but the previous owner added on about 250sqft of kitchen, half bath, and laundry room in the mid-90s and I believe that it is when these golden oak cabinets and laminate countertops were installed. I came to really hate the warm colors in the kitchen and wanted something more \u201ccool\u201d and clean-looking. \n\n\n\n**Contracted out the following work:**\n\n1)\tRemove old laminate flooring, level the floor, and install 450sq ft of slate style porcelain tile. I thought my tile guy did a really good job \u2013 took him and a helper maybe 2 weeks. It looked like a lot of work and he was very meticulous IMO. Paid about $5500 for the floors including materials.\n\n2)\tInstall new baseboards \u2013 probably would have opted to go with the shorter ones given my ceiling height if I could do it over, but whatever. \n\n3)\tInstall white subway tile backsplashes\n\n4)\tInstall quartz countertops (MSI Calcutta laza) \u2013 I pretty much got ripped off by the installer on this. I should have shopped around more on price. I paid $8500 for 65 sqft (also some in the bathroom not pictured) and installation of 2 undermount sinks and removal of the old counters. \n5)\tInstall undermount sink and new faucet, new garbage disposal. Really glad I went with a single tub sink instead of double tub like I had before. I don\u2019t know what people do with 2 sink bowls, but to me it was always just annoying. I splurged on a more expensive Kohler faucet and I love it. Totally worth the extra cost ($275). \n\n\n\n**I did the following work myself:**\n\n1)\tPaint (brush/roll) kitchen cabinets \u2013 uppers are BM Advance \u2013 Chantilly lace, lowers are BM Advance Hale Navy. Everything got sanded down, cleaned, and then 1 coat of Kilz Adhesion. I had a lot of issues with the BM paint because it takes forever to cure and runs like a madman. I think I ended up doing 3 coats with the BM Advance and then on the lowers, I put an additional 3 coats of General Finishes Higher Performance Flat topcoat for extra protection. BM Advance took weeks to cure and I had to be really careful about scuffing it up before it was totally cured. \n\n2)\tNew cabinet hardware, but kept the old hidden hinges since they were in good shape. \n3)\tReplace cabinet valance with more modern design\n\n4)\tInstall LED under cabinet lighting and smart dimmer switches. The brand of lights I got are called \u201cGetinlight\u201d and were kind of pricey, but I really like them because I can adjust the light warmth and they are dimmable. I had a fluorescent over the sink before which was hideous and depressing.\n\n5)\tInstall Zline range hood ($670) \u2013 this was a huge pain because of the location in the attic and just physically attaching it was very difficult without almost 3 people. Also there was electrical running exactly where I wanted to put the vent into the attic, so had to cut off 3 circuits and re-route the electrical around the vent with a couple of new junction boxes. I was going to hire this out, but one quote was $1800 just to install so I finally decided to just do it myself. It was a pain, but I\u2019m glad I was able to do it the way I wanted. This fan has a 760cfm motor and I got a higher powered one because I wanted to install the hood higher up off the stove than is recommended. I did not want to bump my head into the thing or have it disrupt line of sight from the living room into kitchen. It works fine being a little higher and I\u2019m glad I installed it like that. \n\n6)\tPaint walls SW Essential Grey (emerald). \n\n7)\tInstall curtain rods/ curtains. I\u2019ve had issues with curtain rods pulling out of walls with drywall anchors before, so this time I actually attached a strip of 1x4 across the top of the window trim and screwed that into the studs. I painted it in the same color as the walls. Then the curtain rod hardware screws into the 1x4. It\u2019s almost not noticeable at all and is going to be permanently sturdy. I\u2019ve tried every kind of drywall anchor and they always fail. \n\n8)\tTake out old light fixtures and install slim line recessed 4inch led lights. Again, I had issues with physically getting to certain places in my attic to remove the old ceiling boxes for the old fixtures and hook up the electrical for the new lights because of the slope of the old roof and I found some bizarre electrical connections up there that had to be re-done. Sometimes when I thought, \u201coh, I\u2019ll just take this fixture out real quick\u201d, I discovered in 2 cases that literally 6 romex wires were going into 1 tiny ceiling box (18 total wires -12 gauge for no reason of course) and some of the connections were not made with wire nuts but rather just electrical tape wrapped around the wires. On one of those fixtures, when I went up to remove the box, I discovered it was completely hidden under pieces of 2x4 and 2x6 which were nailed (with the biggest nails I\u2019ve ever seen) all around the box and into the joists (ceiling fan was probably there at some point). I had to get a prybar to remove the pointless wood and then make wire connections in the new appropriately sized junction box. The electrical stuff was really just frustrating because it was things I could not have planned for unless I knew what was behind these old fixtures and I hate working in the attic. What should have been a 5 minute task turned into 2 hours. \n\n\n\n**What\u2019s not done yet:**\n\n1)\tRepair ceiling drywall holes and cracks where old fixtures came out. \n\n2)\tPaint ceiling (1200 sq feet total since it goes into the living and dining room, ugh). And doing ceiling last, always a genius move. \n\n\nRight now, I think I\u2019ve spent close to $23k which includes the new refrigerator ($2k) which had to be a slightly weird model since it needed to fit under my abnormally low-ish cabinet. I realize I could have replaced that cabinet to allow for a bigger one, but I just wasn\u2019t up to it and my fridge is never full anyway.  Overall, I\u2019m really happy with the way things have turned out. I don\u2019t plan to ever move from this house, so I\u2019ve really tried to make things the way I want them and not worry about what is normal or what would sell in the future. The bank can deal with that after I die.\n\nedit:formatting",

    "title": "Money pit - dumped 60,000 into 140,000 home",
    "post_text": "As the title says above, I lost my but on my current home. I'm telling this to warn those who have a question in the back of their head about going through with the purchase.\n\nThree years ago I purchased my home, well within my means. It was listed at 150,000, but we closed at 145,000. Nothing was disclosed about the property at the time of selling. I was looking for a year with no good house in the price range so I found this 1970 outdated house that needed a little carpet and paint but that didn't seem like an issue. Most people would be fine just moving in. I was so exhausted looking at all these house I settled on this house. I spent money on a detailed inspection. Nothing major came back.\n\nKnowing that I wanted to clean it up and replace the carpet, floors, paint, appliances, and cabinets, I started my trip to Lowes. I rented a dumpster and purchased all the items I thought I needed. I set aside 10,000 for doing my own home improvements. Two dumpsters later and an empty home, I noticed how poorly this house was built.\n\nIll just list what I noticed up front.\nWiring was cut, damaged, spliced, and nailed through sever places by the last owner.\nMissing a lot of insulation\nWater damaged in three rooms (they tried to repair)\nThere dead rats\nUndersized supporting beams,\nCut main studs on outside walls\nModular home construction\nFoundation shift\nLeaking plumbing\nRotted floors in kitchen, bathrooms, bedroom and living room. About 400sq ft cut out\nMiss wired breaker\nWires going no where in the wall\n\nSo those are some of the items I noticed at this point. I started to get worried but pushed headstrong into the project. I've built race cars, I'm an engineer, and have done a lot of this work before. I've got this, or I thought I did.\n\nAs I'm ripping this apart I noticed that the roof was leaking, so I got a quote for a new roof. Ive done them before but I didn't have the time to fix a whole roof. I decided to get sideing too at this time. I figured I could hire one company and get them on the hook for a total package. I payed a healthy &amp; 18,000 for my small two story house. It was one of the higher prices but the company was recommended and I thought it was worth it. I get a call from my family member in the home building field telling me not to hire them, because of how bad they are. I tried and they said not without going to court or paying a cancelation fee. Long story short, they didn't show up for almost a year, caused major damage to the house with water damage, broke in when I was not home to flip my breaker back on, sloppy work that I had to take off work to fix or tell them to. They had to come back about 15 time for constant repairs over the course of a year. In this time I had finished several rooms and they got damaged from the water. I've fixed it and mh insurance is going after them.\n\nI put tile and granite countertops. I had someone come out to inspect the floor for the load and they said it would be okay. As I finished, I noticed a bounce in the floor. I then had 12 steel peirs put in the crawlspace with concrete pads poured under them to support any kind of flex in the floor. But while down there one day in a bad storm I noticed the water rise up. I'm on a small hill so I thought it was odd. About $2000 for supports. \n\nI talked to the neighbors and they said the area floods. The crawl fills up with several hundred gallons of water each year. I fixed this with putting the gutter drains out to the street and adding two sumps. I then had a bad stench in the house. It's coming from the ground so I pulled all the molded insulation out of the crawl, sprayed all the wood down with mold and spore killer. Added insulation, sealed the vents, added a 20mil barrier with drainage gravel under it. This along with the dehumidifier helped fix the issue. $5,000 later. \n\nGreat, it's almost all fixed right, nope. I then lost my furnace. In the cold and talked to the hvac guy about getting a furnace and ac combo to my house asap. I found out it was undersized, ducts were falling apart, and it was not to code. I replaced all the ducts that were fiber board to sheet metal. Put in a high efficiency furnace and new ac in the spring. This cost me about $3,500. That was only becususe I knew someone.\n\nI noticed ants when I first moved in so I cut the trees down that were too close to the house, tried down the bushes, and sprayed each quarter with an effective spray you can't find in the stores. This helped but now I don't have any trees after cutting down the two and having the other two fall down that year (healthy trees). We get bad winds here in nw Ohio.\n\nI've now fixed all the crazy stupid stuff I found down stairs. I then start to fix the upstairs two rooms and bathroom two years after this all started. I'm about $50,000 in now. Knowing I was going to spend $20,000 in optional repairs, I thought I'm in over my head with this house. Houses only go for $220,000 where I live for bigger/newer homes. What else could I face now. \n\nI found the next issue that makes me ask, SHOULD I JUST WALK AWAY. The floor joist upstairs are spaced 24\", spanning 12' on both sides of the floor, joining in the center. I noticed the 1/2 osb they used flexes greatly when walking on it. I think it was an attic now, and they converted it without knowing what they were doing. The bathroom upstarris was a remodeling project and they managed to screw that up too. Cut electrical lines, cut a whole joist, venting bathroom fan to closed attic area. The drywall is not supported correctly and cracking all over. The heat of the summer is to much for the cheap insulation they installed to the vaulted ceiling but I'm not willing to spend the 15,000 to fix the floors, insulation, and ceiling. I've got another $3,000 so far into fixing the bathroom. \n\nAll togher I've had a few panic attacks, high blood pressure, $50,000 to $60,000 in repairs. I have had so many other issues that I've left out. I'm a mess because of it and its killed my relationships with those around me. Don't ever rush into anything, and trust your gut. If you think it's not for you, walk. I didn't trust my gut. I just gave it a once over and left it to two inspectors. I sit here not knowing what to do now and how to finish paying for all this. I still have another $18,000 left to pay on the loan I had to pull out. If I could sue the person that did all this work, I would. \n\nShould I just walk aways, I think about it every night. After all, it's just a polished turd. \n\n",

I used nails removed from fence boards to attach them to shed. I just nailed em up and then cut off the extra rotten parts after. Was able to build the entire thing with scrap except the roof. Purchased a sheet of 7/16\" OSB for roof along with roof paper, roof roll and flashing. Roof set me back about\n$100. You can prolly find someone throwing put scrap from a roofing job that would be plenty for a small shed. Made a door with more fence rails, put some hinges and a lock on there. Used threaded hooks to store three bikes vertically. And put a bike clamp on the side for repairs. Great use for an old fence rather than burning or discarding.",

Put up tire racks for two sets of tires. We\u2019ve got the racks I just need to sort out where to put them. I\u2019m favouring the diagonal wall for some reason\n \n2. DIY shelves for storage - pretty standard stuff. I think i want it along the right wall, and build in sections for the waste bins, but I\u2019m not sure how far into the garage it should go, and then what goes in between the shelf and the far wall? This includes overhead - two overheads by the garage or overhead storage on the far wall? \n\n3. Work station. I\u2019d love to move my 3D printing gear into the garage and just have a space to organize tools and such as well. For this I\u2019m thinking of using both far and diagonal walls. \n\n4. Whatever\u2019s left is where I\u2019ll put slats for hanging up garden tools and shovels etc. \n\nMy biggest mindfuck is shelving and where to put a workstation. I\u2019ll take any advice and hopefully provide progress pics if I ever pull the trigger on this project. Thank you!!",

This is a relatively small 2 car garage that's on the first floor of a 3 story townhome. There is a ton of vertical space and wall space which just wasn't being used efficiently. Being able to park the cars and move around inside the garage was necessary because we literally have a 5 foot long \"driveway\" so the cars have to be in the garage when at home. I love car detailing and DIY projects, so I have a lot of tools and gear that just didn't have a place. As you can see from the Before picture, it was a disorganized mess and was becoming a bit of a safety hazard.  Glad to finally have this done!",

    "post_text": "Greetings!  \n\nSo it's time to start thinking about redoing the garage / basement workshop situation.  And something I'd benefit from in both locations is a storage / organization system.  \n\nThere are of course a lot of options in this space.  The main two that I'm considering are some sort of slatwall product like ProSlat (or there seem to be a number of near-identical products, no idea what's compatible and what's not) or Ryobi Link.  \n\nLink has some advantages in that you can take tool trays and hang them vertically on the wall, and transfer them to a rolling cart.  I'm not sure how much benefit that actually is.  \n\nBasically I want the same system that will be used in 3 places and ideally is totally interchangeable-  \n\nOne is basement workshop, to do the panel behind the workshop.  That will hold hand tools and power tools, mostly things from screwdrivers to cordless drill size.  Maybe a circular saw.  \nTwo is garage back wall- same deal.  Mainly hanging larger tools or boxes of tools  \nThird is rail along garage side wall.  This will mostly hang garden tools- rakes, shovels, string trimmer / leaf blower, maybe hang a lawn mower if it's strong enough.  \n\nI'd like to pay less if possible obviously :P but I'd rather buy something good once than get crap which doesn't work well and have to replace or supplement it later.  \n\nWhat do you all use/recommend?",

    "post_text": "So I'm in a struggle and I hear different opinions from both sides, both pros and cons, and I don't really see any luxury house tour talk about the trash can at all.\n\nI wonder if it's better to have a drawer for the trash can or if it's better to just let the trash can out in the kitchen.\n\nMy thought is that if I put trash can in the hidden cabinet, everything would look tidy and clean and organized, but is it that what most modern kitchen would do? \n\nReally need some insights on this on how most luxury house or modern kitchen handle this situation\n\nEdit: Omg, Didnt expect the post to blow up lol. I guess it really depends on the personal preference at the end of the day.  and I'm still in the struggle after reading the comments lol. \n\nOn a practical standpoint, it seems nice to just have the trash can out. On a aesthetic stand point, it's nice to hide in the cabinet with the cost of less capacity. (Which I can see why modern housing like to hide in the cabinet for aesthetic view)\n\nEdit2: I read through most comments and I think what I might do is have both hidden cabinets for recycling and stand-alone trash can for general usage. I do know I don't really have a lot of cupboard space, since it's medium or small sized peninsula kitchen, but I don't have other places to put the recycling stuff either. (Recycling is also an issue for me) \n\nI live in a condo btw, so no garage!\n\nEdit3: After more of a thorough thinking, I might want to do the hidden cabinets  It seems like a good idea to do the hidden trash cans regardless of the situations. I can use them for recycling if I have a stand-alone.\nIf I have less time for cooking, then maybe the hidden trash cans would do enough and I can make the kitchen look tidy. but there are some cons I'm thinking about and hope someone can give me more insightful experiences/opinions. \n \n(1) How \"dirty\" and \"wear-out\" can the cabinet be if I don't spill? (like obviously now I know it can be a hassle to clean if I spill, I would be more careful about that) I'm talking about like after 10 years or long term usage.\nWould the cabinet smells bad naturally when I open it? \n\n(2) The cupboard storage, since I would be taking one cabinet for the hidden trash can, I'm concerned if I would have enough cupboard storage.\n\n(3) The workflow, my set up would be stove = cutting board + trash-can = sink, how convenient is this setup?  I would imagine it could block my way from sink to stove, but I would also imagine that I would only use the trash can when I'm using the cupboard. \n\n(4) I usually have a stand-alone trash can for both living room and kitchen. Sometimes my office as well. \nSo for people who have hidden trash cans, do you just use a small trash can in the living room or what's the plan for that?",

    "title": "I turned my garage into a master bedroom",
    "post_text": "My husband and I bought our house in the southeast with the intention of completing this project. The location/lot was fantastic, the house was great, but a little small for our family, and the existing master was tiny. We did all the work ourselves, except for the carpet installation. \n\nIt took about eight months, since my husband and I both work full time and only had weekends to work on it. Some weekends we had too much other stuff to do, and once you factor in vacations and the holiday season, and it really seemed to drag on forever! Total cost was around $10,000. The completed bedroom has king size bed, two desks, dresser, love seat, some small misc furniture, and walk-in closet.\n\nMy husband and I are DIYers, but certainly not professionals, so we had to look up (and make up!) a lot along the way. There were times when I thought we were in over our heads, and days when I thought it was never going to be done, but the final product has exceeded my expectations!\n\n[**See photos and details**](https://imgur.com/a/Nagazwd)\n\nHere's an overview of the process (more details and photos in the link):\n\nStep 1: Remove the garage doors &amp; build a wall. We learned about proper door and window framing, installed window flashing and house wrap, and cedar siding to match the rest of the house. \n\nStep 2: Electrical. This seemed to drag on forever. Luckily my husband works with electrical systems and was comfortable doing the work. Code calls for an outlet every 6 feet, and while the garage already had a few, we had to add a lot more. We also disconnected the garage door openers and just put a cover over them in case future owners want to use them again. We installed a new ceiling fan with light. \n\nStep 3: Install mini-split HVAC unit. I love this thing!  We struggled with the installation a bit and ended up with a faulty unit that needed to be replaced. I would recommend just hiring someone to handle it if you aren't familiar with electrical and A/C installation. But once it's in it's the warmest or coolest room in the house (depending on the season). \n\nStep 4: Fix the ceiling. I did this while my husband worked on the electrical. You can see in the photos what it looked like before, but we decided to keep the existing ceiling, patch some seams, and add some texture to hide the imperfections. It would look a lot better if we had just replaced it, but we did not want to have to empty the attic.\n\nStep 5:  Insulation on the new wall, and drywall throughout. The existing garage walls had paneling on the bottom half which we decided to remove, which meant new drywall on the bottom half of the entire room. This was a chore because we are not very adept at making smooth drywall seams. \n\nStep 6: Paint, trim, window sills - cumbersome but not difficult. We also built a little wall in the corner to hide our well water filter. I was worried it would look really out of place but it blends right in! We also cut a hole in the wall to allow access to the existing master bath. We did not find the door framing to be easy and still struggle with getting the door to close smoothly.  \n\nCarpet was installed professionally at this point.\n\nStep 7: Closet.  The utility closet was as gross as you'd expect. Dirty and infested with spiders. I had doubts that I would ever want to put my clothes in here! But once we ripped out the DIY workbenches, cleaned and painted, it looked much better! We installed a closet organizing system and put a few other little pieces of furniture in there. We had to build a wall with a door to hide and allow access to the water heater and hide the electrical/drainage from the mini-split. The closet is in between the bedroom and the exterior of the house. \n\nThe work is not perfect so please be nice, but I'm open to feedback! I'm happy to answer questions or provide photos of anything I forgot (if I have them!).",

Building raised garden boxes next spring\n\n4. Installing alcove shelves\n\n\nI was leaning towards a miter saw, but project #4 specifically has me re-thinking in. The shelves would be about 10\" deep, so a sliding miter saw could handle that. But I might need to make rip cuts to get them to the right size, which I'd have no way of doing. However, I understand that while table saws can make the same types of cuts, ~~it'll typically do so with less precision than a miter saw.~~ Edit: Perhaps not necessarily true.\n\nAny thoughts?",

    "post_text": "I have a tiny laundry room with no storage or organization built in, and no good place to really put pet food or the litterbox. So a few years ago I stacked my washer and dryer and built a table that I could put laundry related items on, and hide the litterbox underneath. The table is inspired by one Matthias Wandel built, but with worse execution.\n\nOf course like any desk or garage work bench, it quickly became cluttered with multiple bottles of detergent, trash bag  containers, and other junk. So, I did what any other sane person would do, and told myself I would install a cabinet in there, above the table.\n\nA little over two years later, to the day, I finally installed a cabinet and I'm quite happy with it.\n\nIf anyone's curious, I went with another Ikea kitchen wall cabinet-- to match the ones I installed for my kitchen remodel. Of course, the matching doors cost many times the price of the cabinet carcass. Also, installing a single Sektion rail and cabinet is about 1 million times easier than a row of cabinets. The fact that I was able to hang the rail and install the cabinet in about 5 minutes, versus the hours it took to level and plumb the rail system for the kitchen blew me away.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/2nYBf3M\n\nEdit: If anyone has advice for discrete ways to have pet food and water in a common room, I'd appreciate advice. Perhaps some kind of cabinet or table with an enclosure beneath it to put food bowls?",

    "post_text": "So one consistent thing I strive for in my garage is clean/organized.  Not a fan of clutter and stuff getting in my way. Took delivery of a 2017 Volt (love it) and wanted something a bit more nerdy or elegant than just mounting the EVSE charge box on the wall and having 20+ feet of cord sitting around.  \n\nI present my wirelessly controlled drop down charge tube!\n\nhttp://imgur.com/ol1czKN\n\nhttp://imgur.com/2dOmKfw\n\nhttp://imgur.com/1HJgWJs\n\nVideo of it in action: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVQuUVOLkOg\n\nCore of the project is a 24\" stroke linear actuator, 35# force capable (Model PA-14). Purchased from Progressive Automations in Canada. As well as their wireless control module. 100% plug and play unit and getting the thing wired is a snap. (Model PA-31)  They are a pleasure to deal with business wise, and it's a solid built unit.  I had zero experience with actuators before, but things came out fantastically!  www.progressiveautomations.com \n\nConnected to a wireless control box. One FOB in the car, the other on the garage wall.  The pulley system allows for double the stroke length.   Standard 4\" PVC tube with some sprucing up and lacquer spray paint applied. \n\nOriginally was using a 6\" recessed light trim kit as the trim, but the tube didn't freely clear it due to some small alignment issues. (The rafters and other stuff don't sit perfectly level causing some frustration)  And finding any trim kits over 6\" was a huge pain.  Solution?  The white gloss trim you see is actually just the first few inches of an 8\" plastic potter (for plants) creatively re purposed. Needed something with a small lip to cover the actual cut in the drywall. \n\nOverall very very pleased - the EVSE charge tube is connected to a dedicated 240V circuit in the attic and provides level 2 charging speeds right out of the box with the OEM charger (Thanks GM for building it this way, saved me from having to blow 400 on an aftermarket one)   Home is the only place I charge, so \"portable\" isn't needed for my application. \n\nEnjoy!\n ",

This may seem minor but as of right now I have a 50ft hose so its quite heavy and cumbersome, its currently just sitting coiled on the garage floor and that is something I cannot have! I was originally looking at hose boxes as they do a nice job of concealing the hose and you have the ability to have a handcrank etc. but those seem obnoxiously expensive and quite cheap for the entry level ones. I'm not spending $60+ on a decent hose box. I'm thinking a hook or something along those lines would be a great way to store a hose but seeing as how I have a 50' its quite wide and many of the hooks I'm finding on amazon seem a bit lacking in depth.\n\nReally just looking for ideas/recommendations/anything you would like to share about your garage etc!",

    "post_text": "My wife and I are looking to buy a home and we received an engineer report that shows there is significant sloping and that the bedroom wall is 1.75\" out of plumb. I am not handy enough to understand the full repercussions of what this means. Should we pull our offer and look elsewhere? This report is from 2 years ago when the current owners bought the house. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe engineer report is below:\n\n**Observation**\n\nThe home is a wood framed dwelling approximately fifty (50) years old. Per the current owner, a small kitchen addition was added in 1993 and an extension to the family room at the rear of the home was added in 2001. The home is comprised of three (3) general living areas: 1) foyer/kitchen/dining room along the front of the home, 2) bedroom wing to the rear of the home and 3) family room/utility area below the bedroom wing. The front portion of the home is constructed on a basement foundation which is also accessible from the garage at the right side of the home.\n\nThe foundation/settlement issues noted by Regal were identified and confirmed. The sloping floor issues in the bedroom area and family room below were confirmed by using a Zip Level which is a high precision altimeter. From the front landing at the bedroom wing to the rear wall of the master bedroom at the rear of the home, a distance of approximately 40 L.F., the floor was sloping approximately 9\". A similar differential was\n\nnoted in the family room below. The rear wall of the master bedroom was checked with a 4' mason's level and found to be approximately 1 \u00be\" out of plumb. (See Comments below).\n\nSimilarly, the settled foundation condition in the basement (approximately 4\" settlement towards the rear right corner at the sump pit) and garage areas (approximately 4\" settlement towards garage doors) as noted by Regal were also confirmed by this writer.\n\nThe garage slab also had a depressed area making up approximately 2/3rds of the garage floor area. When checking the settlement in the garage, the top of the perimeter block walls were measured and not the surface of the slab. Garage slabs are constructed with pitches towards the overhead doors to drain any vehicle fluids that might otherwise accumulate. In this case, with the settled portion of slab, no such drainage will occur.\n\nThe floor framing above the sump pump in the basement was modified at some point to account for the foundation settlement in this area. Additional blocking was installed at the plate level, below the floor joists. This blocking is approximately 4\" in height. The block foundation in this area has significant cracking including a previously patched vertical crack at the exterior corner of the basement (at basement entry) which supports a wood beam. The basement slab is also significantly cracked in this area and pitches towards the sump pit.\n\nA majority of the basement on the left side of the home (beneath the living room) is finished and provides no access for foundation inspection. Based upon the extent of settlement in other areas of the home, it is likely the rear and portions of the left side foundation in the finished portion of the basement has also sustained some degree of damage.\n\nAside from the sloping floors/slabs and foundation cracks, the home appeared to be free of major drywall cracking throughout the home. (See Comments below).\n\n# Comments\n\nThe home has undergone significant settlement, primarily the rear portion. The cracking found in the basement indicates this area is a 'hinge' point, that is the front of the home does not exhibit the settlement that the rear portion does.\n\nOngoing, active settlement of a home's foundation is typically revealed in ongoing cracks throughout the drywall in the affected areas. As noted above, there were very few drywall cracks noted, and none that correspond to the amount of foundation settlement that has occurred. This is an indication that major settlement has subsided.\n\nAll structures settle, to varying degrees. The conditions observed are classified as differential settlement, which is that one area settles more than an adjacent area. There are several possible reasons as to why the settlement occurred in the first place. To gain a fuller understanding, it is useful to know the general soil conditions in the area. While a site specific soil boring investigation is beyond the scope of this report, published data from the U.S.D.A. National Resources Conservation Service contains general soil data for the area. The mappings indicate the rear of the home is within a zone called Humaquepts, of which the parent material is Loamy Alluvium. Loam being a soil comprised of sand, silt and some clay and Alluvium being loose, unconsolidated soils.\n\nCombined with the proximity of the Yellow Brook to the rear of the property and high ground water, these type soils undergo Immediate Settlement (during construction) and Secondary Settlement, typically to a lesser degree. As noted above, the rear wall of the home is out of plumb to similar degree, percentage wise, as the floors. This indicates the rear of the home settled as a 'unit' (foundation and framing as one).\n\nThe front portion of the home is contained in the soil zone known as Udorthents, which is a granular material with parent material consisting of fill and/or disturbed original\n\nsoil material. As with the case above, such soils are subject to consolidation upon loading, resulting in the settlement that has occurred, but at a different rate and to a different degree. The mappings do not indicate any organic soils, peat, etc. which can be subject to ongoing long term settlements.\n\nAnother possible cause of the settlement is improperly compacted backfilled soils. When areas beneath foundations are over excavated and backfilled, specific compactive efforts are necessary but many times are not performed. This results in the soil consolidating (compacting) under the weight of the structure.\n\nFinally, the additional localized settlement in the rear right corner of the basement is adjacent to the sump pit. Over time, constant pumping of water from a sump pit draws in fine soils along with the water, causing voids beneath the foundation, followed by settlement as in this case.\n\n# Summary\n\nBy all indications, the settlement which has occurred along the rear of the home and in the garage has largely subsided. Past renovation projects (additions) have been worked around the 'settled' condition of the home.\n\nTechnically the home is in 'serviceable' condition as it is in use. All indicators throughout the rear wing of the home point to a settlement condition that has largely subsided.\n\nUnderpinning that area, at this point (either conventional or helical piles) will provide nominal additional support, at best. Levelling the home is possible but will likely cause extensive damage to much of the interior of the home (wall and ceiling cracks, racked doors, tile cracking, plumbing, etc.) and would require removal/replacement of the decks. Even the roof will be impacted where the front and rear portions of the home join. While a construction estimate is beyond the scope of this report, the costs would be substantial.\n\nThe settlement in the basement foundation walls and slab in the sump pump area was compounded by pumping over the years and may continue until stabilized. Helical piers would be an acceptable stabilization measure in this area. The piers should extend along the rear, right side and front walls (at beam support point). A fair amount of the slab in this area would need to be removed to facilitate pier installation and would also need to be replaced.\n\nTo maintain the current condition, all foundation cracks, interior and exterior, should be filled utilizing hydraulic cement mortar. This will serve to maintain the load path across separated portions of foundation. The basement slab is not a structural component of the home but at a minimum patching should be done such that no tripping hazards exist.\n\nIn closing, while stabilizing portions of the home and patching as noted above will help maintain the serviceability of the home, they will not serve to level the home to within standard tolerances.\n\nThese opinions are based upon my inspection of the premises, training and experience as an engineer and are offered with a reasonable degree of engineering certainty.",

I'm excited to have my own space of decent size - the \"workshop\" side will be approximately 10'x'20 and we will wall it off in the long term.  The basement is unfinished but the ceiling is at 7' and I'm 6'5\" so it works out.  \n\nWhat are some organizational recommendations I should look at?  Like I said we are OCD neat freaks but in the garage with tight spaces it gets inevitably messy. Excited about this and want to do it right!  \n\nI don't have tons of money to spend so those larger rolling metal organizers seem nice but not sure I'm sold if that's the best way to go - I like to see a lot of my tools up on the wall rather than having to go through drawers.  Except for washers/nails/screws/anchors etc\n\nWe do just enough woodworking where I'd want to prepare for that.  There's an egress window so maybe look into ventilating, I just don't know how expensive that gets - might be a \"Down the line\" thing.  There's also a super large working space about 4'x4x, looks like an old kitchen island with a wood top\n\nThanks in advance for any advice! Looking forward to hearing what I should be checking out/asking for this holiday season. Cheer\n\nEdit: also what about flooring? Eventuallit other half of basement will be carpet but obviously not on the workshop/utilities side",

Before I go too crazy building shelves and workbenches I\u2019d like to get an idea of what it would take to finish the inside. I\u2019m fairly handy but don\u2019t have much experience with anything of this scale. The garage is a 2.5 stall, about 19 ft deep by 21.5 ft wide. Cement floor to ceiling beam is 88\u201d. I\u2019d like to eventually get it insulated so I can use it in the winter, but I don\u2019t really know where to start.\n\nPossible to do list:\n\n- Add / relocate a couple outlets (including the 220v near)\n- Add real lighting instead of one old fluorescent plugged into an outlet in the ceiling\n- Install a door to the right of the overhead door (where the window is now)\n- Insulate - whatever the easiest DIY option is. I\u2019d like to be able to do as much of the work myself, both for budget reasons and self satisfaction\n- (?) Add ventilation / wire for a heater? Do I need to worry about ventilation if I\u2019m going to insulate?\n- Drywall\n\nI\u2019m assuming this is a project I\u2019ll chip away at over the next year or so - I\u2019m not planning on having it done before this winter. I know it makes sense to get the electrical figured out before finishing the wall, but is it ok to go one wall at a time? I\u2019ll need to shuffle things around as a access each area. And how should I tackle the ceiling with the exposed beams? Any pointers or resources will be greatly appreciated.",

    "post_text": "Hey everyone, I'm new to home ownership, and there a lot of small-ish things that need to be addressed in my house based on the inspection and projects I want to pursue while I am on paternity leave. I have been following the recommendation I've seen on here and elsewhere to always get 3 quotes for a job, but I'm finding the whole process to be kind of a pain in the ass when I'm juggling multiple different projects. For example, I need to replace a wooden support post in the basement with a steel support, install a water-powered backup sump pump, add either central AC or mini splits to the second floor, increase the electrical capacity of my two car garage, and get a concrete floor poured in the garage. Some of these things can be done by the same professional, but some can't, and since I'm new to all this, I don't really know what I can trust a general contractor for, and what I should be finding a specific niche professional for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, this isn't a post about me complaining, but wondering 1. if a better way to get multiple quotes exists, and 2. if not, is it something people would want to see exist? I'll use solar installations as an example of a process that was, by comparison, really easy to get 3 quotes for. I used EnergySage and Drone Quote, both of which get the basic information about the project from you, gather some data, and then connect you with installers who place bids for the project. I ultimately decided to hold off on solar in lieu of some bigger priorities, but it was great to not have to call a bunch of different places, leave messages, wait for their calls, sometimes miss them, get a voicemail, call again, etc. it all was just in one dashboard, with the prices, reviews, and background of each installer. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes something similar exist for general contractors, plumbers, electricians, and/or masons? I just think it would be so amazing if I could list out the projects that need to be done, take some pictures and enter some measurements, and let local professionals give me at least rough quotes and even let me know if they can take on multiple projects on my list, perhaps at a discount because it's less travel for them to do multiple jobs in one place. That way everything is organized, I can keep track of all the professionals who gave quotes, and make a more informed decision than just googling for a contractor in my area and going with one that has good google reviews, you know?",

    "post_text": "Hey guys,\n\nI feel like I'm usually pretty savvy when it comes to electrical stuff, but I'm kind of stumped right now.  I recently bought a couple of the [GE My Touch Smart Wifi Switches](https://www.smarthomegadgets.shop/products/ge-mytouchsmart-in-wall-wi-fi-smart-switch?variant=34741146419368&amp;currency=USD&amp;utm_medium=product_sync&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_content=sag_organic&amp;utm_campaign=sag_organic&amp;utm_campaign=gs-2019-01-24&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=smart_campaign&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwiOv7BRBREiwAXHbv3M86Dd5rV5Opg0hBHNa17qvIyhUjsKTEBV3cQ_HnrzvZjIwQDnQPNRoCWdQQAvD_BwE) (the hub-less kind).  I installed one in my kitchen for my back deck lights with no issue, and another in my garage for my front flood lights.\n\nAs soon as I wired in the one in the garage it went into \"pairing mode\", blue light blinking rapidly, yet it would not pair or show up in the app, nor could I set it to \"manual\" mode to create its own network for me to include.  Nor would it operate as a switch regularly.  The box it came in was pretty dinged up, so I thought maybe it had been a returned item and was bad out of the box.  I returned it and got a different one (also in a very dinged up box), this one had the exact same issue, again I thought maybe it was a return, maybe someone had bought both, broken them and returned them.  I got a 3rd switch, installed it and same problem.  I'm not a super smart guy, but I'm smart enough to know it's not a problem with the switch at this point.  I'm confident it's installed correctly (neutral, line and load are all to the correct terminal) and since I was able to set-up the first switch no problem I don't think it's user error on the app side.\n\nDo you guys know of something else that could be causing this?  My next step is to put the \"broken\" switch in somewhere else temporarily just to test it and confirm it's 100% no broken.  But assuming the switch is functioning properly does any one have any suggestions as to what I should be looking for that could be causing this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUPDATE/SOLVED\n\nI don't know if anyone is paying attention to this still, but I figured it out.  basically it was an order of operations issue (I think).  My router and modem were on the same circuit as the switch, so when I flipped on the breaker to the switch it would take the wifi a while to boot up which seems to hav confused the switch (I guess?).  I plugged the router and modem into a different circuit, fired up the switch and voila it connected right away.  Even after i moved the router etc back to the original circuit everything kept playing nice.  Also it immediately asked for a firmware update to that switch which may have been a factor as well...",

Do I need to have to have  either of those mentioned materials behind it to support the board?also,  Do I have to  Insulate the walls?\n\n One of the reasons I don't want to put up anything is because I want to worry about mould.

Do I even need to put up walls or should I just leave it unfinished and take down the lousey shelf and just reorganize everything?\n\nIm just undecided on this whole process but I also don't want to hire a contractor.

    "title": "Serious Eye Irritant: Injection Foam problem?",
    "post_text": "Alright, weird post coming at ya. I'm at the end of my rope trying to diagnose what is causing some pretty serious eye irritation in our house. At this point, I am almost positive it is related to the injection foam insulation we had done in February of this year. But here's the details...\n\n**Problem**: It's kind of like someone sprayed a small amount of pepper spray in our garage. Stand in there for 10 seconds, and your eyes water up + burn. Sometimes you can feel it inside the house, but always to a lesser extent. \n\nHere's the timeline of events...\n\n**Early February**: Injection spray foam insulation done to beef up poor insulation on walls in our first floor. FYI: Townhome, 1990 build in MD. [Album of pictures + a layout of what walls were done](https://imgur.com/a/YRf9mrs).\n\n**May**: Super happy with the job. BUT...warmer weather hits and we start to notice some eye irritation in the garage. I completely empty the garage, throw out any chemical stuff, and scrub the whole thing down. No change. Starting to think it's the foam insulation.\n\n**June**\n1: Irritation is consistent enough that we bring a rep from the insulation company out to experience the irritation + inspect the work. He says he doesn't feel anything (which I doubt, everyone who comes over says they feel it), says the works looks good, offers to stay in touch. \n\n2: No pictures, but I removed a panel of drywall in the garage just to see if the foam looked normal. Everything looked fine. \n\n3: I called around to a few people who test air quality, but so far everyone has declined saying that they only test for organic problems (like mold) and don't handle chemical issues. \n\nThis whole thing isn't life or death, but it's infuriating. Can be very uncomfortable to be in our house. Garage isn't the only place we had foam done, but it's absolutely where the problem is. I'm almost want to just take it down to the studs and get all the foam out, although I'd hate to just throw away the $$$ we spent on that project.\n\nTechnically, I don't KNOW the insulation is causing the problem. But I've removed every variable I can think of. It's the only thing that has changed in my house since last summer. Weather got warm, eye irritant shows up. Warmer days = irritation is stronger. Cooler days = irritation is less of a big deal. \n\nIf I knew for sure there was a problem with the foam insulation, I would have a pretty big project ahead of me. Because I would want to remove all the insulation in the entire first floor, not just the garage. Such a weird issue...\n\nAny advice on where to go from here? What kind of company could help me figure out WHAT is going on? Do I get home insurance involved? Other variables I'm not thinking of?\n\n",

    "post_text": "I really hope I format this appropriately and don't break any rules. I apologize in advance if I do.\n\nSo a little backstory: I live near Pittsburgh, PA and the home I live in was owned by my mother. She didn't live in it, she just rented it to some tenants. Unfortunately, these tenants were crooks. They have a long history of moving to a place, wrecking it, never paying rent, then skipping out and fleecing someone else. This family, if you can even call it that, moved in and lived here for over a year without paying rent and only left after they saw they were about to be removed by force by the police. Shortly after... my mother died and things just got worse. My grandmother took them to court, but they dodged it at every turn. I decided to move in since I was moving back home anyway. I was going to live with my mother, but that didn't work out, obviously. That's about all that's relevant to this at the moment.\n\nThey did a lot of damage and I'm wondering if it's even worth it to do repairs or just deal with it and try to ignore it. The damages are, but are not limited to: ripping down the metal awning on the side of the house to scrap for metal, ripping out the wrought iron railing on the outside stairs to scrap for metal, holes in the walls from wood screws(?), marker, crayon, and grease stains on the walls from his children running wild since all four of them didn't attend any sort of schooling, sloppy paint on half the living room wood flooring (he painted AROUND the furniture he had on the floor at the time), added curtain fixtures on the walls BELOW the original curtain fixtures (so ugly bolts and holes in the walls when there were perfectly good curtain fixtures right there), broken or missing doorknobs, bashes in the walls (looks like a punch or someone rammed the wall with furniture), a step that's cracked almost in half, damaged drawers in the kitchen, bad tiles in the bathroom and kitchen (they're lopsided, incomplete, leaky, etc.), bad paint in the bathroom, and some structural damage in the basement where they ripped out the utility tub (basically a pipe hanging free with concrete stuck to it where it was separated from the floor).\n\nIt really bothers me that I have to live with all this stuff broken or messed up, but I don't know where to begin with repairs or if it's even worth it. I've been living here for almost two years now and have only done some small repairs, like a new kitchen faucet, fixing some doors that were hanging loose, and other little things. I also didn't make too many repairs because I didn't want to fix anything that might need photographed or documented for the courts when they went after those crooks for damages, but I think them getting away with it is a foregone conclusion now. There's also \"improvements\" I want to make, but I don't know how to start that process, either.\n\nSo, what should I do? Should I make the repairs and build my dream house? Or accept defeat and ignore all the bad stuff?\n\n**Pics of what the house is SUPPOSED to look like (before they moved in) and how I WANT it to look again:**\n\n*Exterior*\nhttps://imgur.com/ViimcsG\n\n*Kitchen*\nhttps://imgur.com/jxe52dM\nhttps://imgur.com/GKG76YX\n\n*Bathroom*\nhttps://imgur.com/yRvgo8l\n\n**Pics of how it looks now after the damage (pardon my personal possessions):**\n\n*Exterior*\nhttps://imgur.com/J5YX1K7\n\n*Kitchen*\nhttps://imgur.com/nUlGEon\nhttps://imgur.com/JD38mDX\n\n*Bathroom*\nhttps://imgur.com/klAgHn1\nhttps://imgur.com/5rE3cMa",

    "title": "(Unfinished) basement walls are damp",
    "post_text": "Hi everyone\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/f5ftbMX\n\nHow bad is this? It's assumed to be a rubble foundation (when replacing a basement window we could see a part of the un-parged foundation) on a fairly old house (exact date unknown, inspector figured betweens 1910s to 1920s).\n\nI bought this place recently (this spring) and it definitely flooded at least once in its past -- at that point insurance brought in a team to dig in a weeping tile and install a sump pump and wrap the foundation. However the contractors that did it are very sleazy on the spectrum, even if they were brought in by the insurance; they never answered any of my calls/emails about this and other work done around the house.\n\nThe basement is a rectangle with a square at the back -- these are on the rectangle, other side is a party wall, square side has remained fairly dry.  It's got a flat roof.\n\nMy neighbour has a driveway that butts up against these spots so I used plastic mastic (the roof sealant product that comes in a caulk tube) to re-seal the interface. It did ok in light rain -- but we've had quite a bit of rain the last week (I live in the Ottawa, Ontario area).\n\nLocal Old Guy at the local hardware store told me this is normal for a house of this era; that the water will get pulled into the foundation, down into the weeping tile, and then out with the sump pump. He said that if ever I wanted the basement finished, I could either paint a waterpoofing solution and then apply a vapor/moisture barrier, or just apply the barrier. This conflicts with what I've heard from This Old House's Tom Silva, who says the basement should be free of any dampness like this before trying to finish it (making me think that any moisture == something isn't working).\n\nI'd like some more opinions though. I run a dehumidifier, as it seems to be typical for this area. I tried digging to find a dimple board but quickly hit stones/gravel instead. The soil in this neighbourhood is about ~100ft of clay, and some online sources have said that stone/gravel is better than dimple board for this type of soil (or that they should be combined together).\n\nNothing's been damaged down there, but I'd just like to know that my house isn't going to start falling apart or that things won't start rotting if they're propped up against the walls!\n\n*update 2019-Nov-11*: Just wanted to update any time travellers. \n\nI had a bit of work done since this post. I ended up finding out my water main was still lead from the city demarcation to my basement, and hired a local company to have it replaced. They dug out my front yard, at which point I discovered that my foundation was wrapped with DMX dimpleboard, and was correctly attached all the way down.\n\nThis got me very suspicious. It's not obvious from the layout, but the wall they worked with to pass the new copper service is opposite the majority of the moisture. This wall had some evidence of moisture, but it was definitely a lot drier (my suspicion? this was from the flooding that caused the previous owner to wrap the foundation).\n\nThe section opposite the driest one has a kitchen which looks like an early addition (or at least, it's different enough -- a bit smaller, has vinyl siding not brick, and has a separate roof, being only 1 storey). It also has a deck with a roof attached to the kitchen. So there's two roofs, and my inspector seemed confident the kitchen drained onto the deck, into the garden, and it wasn't amazing but also wasn't a code violation.\n\nIn the fall I discovered by pure accident (just hanging out watching my bedroom window) that the kitchen roof doesn't drain onto the deck roof -- it actually drains to the side onto a side yard!!! bastards!!!\n\nI scheduled someone to come install eavestroughs and gutters to carry the water away, and they did it around the same time as the big dig. I want to say gutters came after, but I'm not sure.\n\nWell -- either there was a slow leak and that saturated the walls (unlikely), or it was as simple as water came off the kitchen roof, onto the side yard, and slowly made its way to the front of the house saturating the long wall by the driveway... but my moisture problems have gone away since.",

    "title": "DIY Mould Management",
    "post_text": "Over the past three years, I've learnt a lot about mould, how and why it forms, how to prevent it, and how to remove it once it's already formed.\n\nThis is going to be a lengthy post. There's no TLDR - if you want to prevent mould, you need to be aware about all of the below. It's one of those things I wish someone had taught me before I bought a house, and unfortunately, I've learnt the hard way.\n\nI'm also want to point out that this is from a DIY perspective. If the mould is out of control, seek professional help. Some of the situations described below are beyond the scope of a DIY fix.\n\n\n\n1. What is mould? What is mildew? Why does it grow in my house?\n\nWithout getting technical, mildew is an invisible precursor to visible mould - it's that musty smell from old damp clothes that were stuffed in an old drawer or wardrobe for too long.\n\nMould is that horrible fungal growth ranging from black patches to white fluffy spores and everything in between.\n\nMould and mildew are bad for your health because they release microscopic airborne spores into the room (that's the musty wet old room smell), and these cause respiratory irritation, and can exacerbate chronic respiratory conditions.\n\nIt also damages whatever it's growing on, pretty much because it uses it as a food source and literally eats it away.\n\nNow, mould is present on the surface of and even inside of many natural materials, the obvious example being wood. It's also found in clothes.\n\nOn its own, it doesn't do anything other than sit there.\n\n*However,  it grows if the conditions are right, and that's when it causes problems.*\n\n- Dark (out of direct sunlight)\n- Wet or damp\n- Still air/lack of ventilation\n- Usually absorbent surface like wood or wallpaper or sometimes paint\n\nIf the above conditions are present, mould will grow even on an otherwise clean and made material like plastic.\n\nUnfortunately, the above conditions are all too often found inside homes. Sometimes you end up unlucky and your roof is leaking into a dark space in your house, and sometimes it's because people don't understand the importance of maintaing their homes.\n\nWe all wish we could just live in a space and it takes care of itself, but the reality is that you need to be aware of the environment within that space and if necessary, *you* need to maintain it.\n\nI'll now talk about each of the 4 conditions needed for mould growth.\n\n\n\n2.1 Dark \n\nSunlight prevents the growth of mould. It's therefore logical that mould thrives in dark places. Behind the wardrobe, *inside* the wardrobe, or behind the bed, or down the side of the sofa.\n\nThis is the reason that people hang out clothes with mould or mildew in the sun - the sunlight eventually kills the mould, and the smell goes away.\n\nHowever, there's only so much you can do about dark spaces inside your house. You can't be lighting up every nook and cranny after all.\n\nAdditionally, not every dark place gets mould. And sometimes you get mould in and around the window sill which is usually flooded with sunlight, so it doesn't seem to apply there.\n\nThe reason for these conindrums is that darkness is not the only condition required for mould growth. Darkness simply conteibutes to mould growth. You might find the first instance of mould behind your wardrobe but you won't ever find the first instance in front of the wardrobe.\n\nNow, short of putting a low wattage lightbulb in dark places (which apparently works but is usually unfeasible), there's nothing you can do about darkness.\n\nIt's just something you need to bear in mind - where possible, do keep an eye on those areas periodically, because the dark areas are where you are likely to get mould.\n\n\n\n2.2 Wet/damp\n\nYou must keep your house dry. There are no ifs and buts about this, do whatever you have to do to keep the house dry, because moisture is the main thing that encourages mould growth. I don't care how much you like to use that shiny new steam generator iron, or your steam mop, or whatever else is making your house moist, you need to figure out how to dry the house.\n\nThere's several ways that your house can become moist, and I'm going to deal with each of them one at a time. I will pay special attention to condensation, because it is the most common cause, but I will also deal with it last because it is more complicated than most people think.\n\nDon't forget other simple causes of dampness such as spilt drinks - they just need cleaning up and drying before mould grows.\n\n\n\n2.2.1 Leaking pipe\n\nYour pipe burst or is leaking, and water is seeping everywhere. You can see where the water is starting from and you can see it spreading across your beautiful wall. The wall is wet as you touch it, and even as you run your hand across it, wiping away the water, yet more droplets form to replace the ones you just removed. Then before you know it, you see the edges of the wallpaper swell up and start to peel away. The walls that are painted are starting to bubble and flake away.\n\nIf this happens to you, then go and find the water shut off tap for your house, and switch it off.\n\nThen go and call an emergency plumber and get the pipe fixed right now.\n\nAfter the pipe is fixed, re plaster and repaint.\n\nIt's a big job, an expensive problem, and the longer you put it off, the worse it will become. Cut your losses and sort it out now.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Leaking roof\n\nYou're lucky to have a roof over your head to keep you dry, except it's actually allowing your wall to become wet in the corner.\n\nMould has started to grow there and it somehow jumped from the wall to your wardrobe, and you only noticed all this in the first place because the mould went through the back of the wardrobe and jumped again onto your favourite pair of jeans.\n\nYou need to call someone out to check out what's going on up there. Maybe you could look yourself from inside the attic, but since most rooves have lining internally, the problem might not be visible from there. It could simply be a dislodged tile.\n\nThe other thing it might be is blocked guttering - if you have moss, leaves, and other debris blocking the gutter that goes around your roof, it might be overflowing and seeping down the side of your house, into and through the permeable brick and eventually into your interior wall. As with roof problems, call someone out to clear or replace your gutters.\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Rising Damp\n\nWhy the heck is the bottom corner of your living room wet and mouldy and why is it rising higher every day? Water doesn't flow up!?\n\nIn this case, the bottom corner of your house has somehow become exposed to the damp ground underneath. Water is being absorbed by capillary action into the bricks and up into your room. The only way (as far as I know) to fix this is to install a damp proof membrane underneath.\n\nIt's a big job but it will separate your house from the damp ground underneath, prevent the damp from rising, and prevent mould from growing.\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Condensation\n\nThis section is big because you need to know about humidity and ventilation to understand condensation within the home.\n\nEvaporated water is always present in the air in the form of water vapour. If the air cools down, the water vapour also cools down. If it cools enough, the water vapour condenses into liquid, which contributes to damp and moisture, and subsequently mould growth.\n\nThere are several factors at play when we talk about condensation.\n\nHumidity is the measure of water vapour present in the air. There is sometbg called absolute humidity, which is the total amount of water in the air. The *relative* humidity is the percentage saturation of water vapour present in the air at a given temperature. The reason we consider temperature is that warm air is able to hold more water. And because there are fluctuations in temperature all day, that's why we use relative humidity over absolute humidity.\n\nNow, let's say I have 50% relative humidity in my house. It means that at the current temperature, whatever that may be, the air is holding half the maximum amount of water vapour it can hold. A relative humidity level of about 40-60% is about right. The air is humid enough that it feels comfortable to breathe, and not so saturated that it's depositing water everywhere. It's also not so dry that your nasal airways become dry and irritated.\n\nNow let's say I take a nice long shower but leave the bathroom door open, and then I go and iron my clothes with my big steam generator iron. All the steam from the shower and iron are now in the air. The humidity has gone up to 70%. At this higher level, water vapour is more likely to be deposited in liquid form as condensation on surfaces. In fact, the air in the room is noticeably humid and wet. If it stays like this, you'll get mould everywhere.\n\nFor this reason, it is absolutely imperative that you keep the doors shut to trap steam in a single room, and open a window nice and wide to allow the steam to exit the room. Don't let the steam humidify and dampen your room.\n\nNow, let's say your humidity is about 40-60% and you're avoiding steam in the house, yet still every morning you wake up and the windows are soaked with condensation. Why is this happening?\n\nWell, basically, you are excreting water vapour through breathing and sweating, and the air becomes a bit too humid overnight. No matter what you do, human activity will always increase humidity within the home. Although you do your best to minimise the increase in humidity, it still goes up all the time\n\nThe subsequent condensation only happens when the air cools down. Now, your radiators might be on all night, and the room is nice and toasty, so what's the deal with the wet windows? \n\nBasically, the window, even with double glazing, is cold - in particular, the glass of the window is much colder than the air inside your room. When the warm humid air touches the window, the water vapour cools and condenses. Same happens around the window sill.\n\nYour only option is to wipe off the water in the morning and drain away the water somewhere. *Do not* leave your cloth out to dry in the room, otherwise the water will evaporate and go straight back into the air, and then back onto your windows.\n\nOccasionally, you might find that a wall is damp with condensation. This typically happens on a cold external wall. This is because the external walls lose heat to the outside air while the internal walls are warmed from both sides by the air inside your house.\n\nThe only proper way to fix a cold external wall is to insulate it properly. That way, the internal aspect of the newly insulated wall will be warmer, and your 40-60% humidity warm air won't cool down too much when it touches the new warm wall.\n\n2.3 Still air and ventilation \n\nNow in the past, houses used to be draughty, and therefore well ventilated. Windows weren't perfectly sealed, window vents were open, there were wall vents permanently open, and the fireplace led to the open chimney, etc. As a result, all the warm (and humid) air was continually blown outside and replaced by cooler (dry) air from outside. Low humidity meant less mould, and the trade off was that you wear a jumper and socks to protect yourself from the draught.\n\nSo we need ventilation to simultaneously push humid air out of the houses and draw dry air in.\n\nNowadays houses are energy efficient with minimal heat loss. Insulation accounts for a large part of this, but so does draught proofing. Once you stop all the draughts, the warm air stays inside. Unfortunately, so does the humidity, and nobody really ever points that out.\n\nAs you now know, we have to get rid of that pesky humid air. Since it won't happen through draughts, we need to do it ourselves. One (expensive) option is to install a HVAC system in your home. Another option is to buy a dehumidifier (and pay the electricity costs). The third option is to open all your windows for 15 minutes in the morning and allow all the fresh dry air into your house, and the close the windows - voil\u00e0! The air is no longer humid! But it is cold, so now you have to wait for your radiators to heat up the air again which adds to your gas bill.\n\nAlthough it's a bit counter intuitive from an energy saving perspective to let all the warm (humid) air out in the morning, it is simply a cost we must pay to reduce humidity in our homes and prevent the curse that is mould from growing within them. Additionally, it's not that expensive to heat up the air in the home - the walls are already warm.\n\nHaving said that, it all your walls are well insulated and warm, you may never eperience condensation on walls - in which case you may not need to reduce your humidity.\n\nNow, other than whole house ventilation or dehumidification, you need to ventilate storage spaces to move any humidity out of there. If your wardrobe has a door, then its airspace is effectively isolated from the rest of the house. If there is a slightly damp item of clothing in there, you have a damp, dark area, with no airflow, and lots of clothes and wood for the mould to feed on.\n\nOld wardrobes had louvred doors for this very purpose - to allow air to move in and out of the wardrobe. If like me you have a nice new sliding wardrobe or something, you need to go and drill some holes in the sides and top to allow air to move in and out. Once you make these holes, humid air inside the wardrobe will be free to escape.\n\nAdditionally, if you stuff the wardrobe with clothes top, bottom, left, and right, then there is no passage for the air to move. As a result, you must take care to leave some space for the air to circulate.\n\nIt's also for this reason of ventilation that people use 'breathable' fabric storage bags, or plastic boxes with air vents. If you put clothes into a plastic bag and tie it up, the small amount of humid air inside that bag will eventually condense and allow mildew/mould to grow (dark, damp, no ventilation).\n\n2.4 Surface type\n\nLet's say you have a humid room or a wet wall. If you have wallpaper, it will absorb the modified quite readily and keep it, thus leading to mould.\n\nA painted wall is less likely to absorb moisture, but once the moisture is in, again, mould can grow on the paint.\n\nMy bathroom has plastic cladding, and the taps and shower are all metal naturally - yet they still grow mould! However, it's easy, of course, to clean mould from these non-permeable surfaces .\n\nIn my situation, I had humidity, poor ventilation, wallpaper that had been painted over, plus a cold wall. Due to this, the cold wall was getting condensation, and absorbing into the wallpaper and getting mouldy. I took down all the wallpaper and re-skimmed and re-painted the room (insulated cavity wall and plaster with no internal insulation). I've changed the layout of my room and minimised humidity. I wipe my window every morning and open the window for 20 minutes. The wall remains cool to touch, but there's no longer any condensation, and there's certainly no wallpaper to absorb moisture. My wardrobe is now on an internal wall. Thankfully, my mould problem is now resolved.\n\n3. Cleaning mould\n\nIf you have mould growth, *the single most important thing to do* is to fix the environmental conditions that allowed it to grow.\n\nHowever, in reality, when you come across the dreaded patch of mould on a Sunday night at 11pm, there's not much that can be done at that time.\n\nIn the meantime, you need to clean the mould. Look online and you'll find dozens of website swearing by lemon juice, white vinegar, and baking soda. I've tried all three of these in different combinations and strengths and gone through bottles of the stuff.\n\nThey don't really work.\n\nOn a flat non-permeable surface, you could just scrub it away with water.\n\nOn porous or absorbent materials like wood, none of them work.\n\nOn clothes, vinegar does a good job of eliminating the smell, but so does washing the clothes in the washing machine. And after you use vinegar, you have to put the clothes in the washing machine anyway, so using vinegar is just an unnecessary step.\n\nI have found that on walls and ceilings and other surfaces around the house, a commercial sprayable antifungal and bleaching agent is the best solution. I spray liberally, allowing it to soak into the surface, and the patch of mould then literally dies in front of my eyes, shrivelling away and turning brown, and then disappearing entirely. All I then have to do is wipe away the excess spray, and the dead mould. The downside to this is that the agent bleaches any fabric it touches - be careful if you have carpet. I have an expensive bleach-cleanable carpet so it doesn't make a difference to me. Another downside is the smell - it makes the whole house smell of bleach for 2 days, and if I'm too close for too long, the fumes make my eyes water. It's still totally worth it in my opinion.\n\nIt really is imperative that you clean the mould as soon as possible. The longer you leave it, the more it spreads and releases spores. \n\nAs for clothes - I wipe off any mould, throw them in the washing machine on a 60\u00b0C wash with some antibacterial cleanser. I know antibacterial is different to antifungal, but I can't find any antifungal washing machine liquid, and when I use the antibacterial, the smell of mildew disappears completely. Also be careful to only fill your washing machine to maximum 75% or so capacity. You need space for the clothes move in order to wash effectively. Then I tumble dry the clothes, and then iron them, being careful to allow them to dry before storing in my wardrobe.\n\nAs for cleaning wood, it's hit and miss. The stain never seems to leave, but after 2 or 3 applications of commercial antifungal spray, the wood seems to be saved.\n\nFor some items, I'm not willing to risk it. For example, I had some collapsible fabric boxes that got really mouldy - no way am I going to remove the fabric, clean it, spray the cardboard, then let them dry, then stitch the fabric back onto the box, and then put it back into the wardrobe. It's much less hassle to simply buy a new one. Those mouldy boxes went straight into the bin.\n\n4. Closing words\n\nMould is an awful and insidious problem to have to deal with. It really is a burden to have to resolve, and seeing your home and possessions become damaged due to it can really get you down.\n\nThe best option is prevention, which requires education, which is why I wrote this post.\n\nIf, however, mould has already grown and you just clean the mold without resolving the root issue, then you won't win.\n\nInstead, accept that you have work to do, and get the job done properly.",

The backs aren't perfectly flat; there are four raised bumps, one at each corner, where the screws would normally go. The underside of the cabinets are melamine and I would prefer not to drill into them if at all possible.\n\nStarting with a clean, grease- and residue-free underside and light fixture...\n\nI first tried double-sided foam tape. I use two 3' lengths, and had to stack three layers high in order to get it high enough to clear the \"screw bumps\" mentioned earlier. This worked for about ten minutes before the fixtures fell down. The tape had no problem sticking to itself or to the melamine, but it wouldn't get a good grip on the light fixture.\n\nMy second attempt involved [magnets](http://www.harborfreight.com/50mm-round-magnet-96651.html). I hot-glued the magnets to the melamine and then stuck the lights to the magnets. The magnets were tall enough to clear the \"screw bumps\" which was a bonus. This worked for about a half hour before the lights fell. Sometimes the hot glue released from the melamine, sometimes it released from the magnet. I know the magnet itself is strong enough as it never let go of the light fixture.\n\nThe only thing left that I can think of is [industrial Velcro](http://www.velcro.com/Products/Adhesive-Backed/Heavy-Duty/Industrial-Strength-Extreme.aspx) but I again run into the problem of the \"screw bump\" and I can't stack Velcro like I stacked the tape.\n\nAny other thoughts for a \"permanent-nonpermanent\" mounting? The magnets seem like the best bet if I can only figure out why they're letting go. Any ideas there?",

I have a key because the seller is elderly and wanted me to be able to check on it every so often.  Today I found something that my inspector missed and it's freaking me out.  \nThe two story portion of the house sits over a full basement which is very dry and recently recoated.  The 1-story portion was originally a shed/attached garage.  theres a small access panel in a nearby room that lets you see the very short crawlspace (appx 1.5ft) with the dirt floor.  That was the only access that I had found until tonight when I stopped by and was looking at pipes and realized that a section of tile in the bathroom was loose.  I lifted it off to find a door.  Under the door I found a full-height basement in the exact footprint of the bathroom with 3-4ft of standing water.  The beams seem to be solid and not damaged by the humidity but obviously this is a big issue.  Also, I'm a little freaked out by the symbols on the wall and the writing that says \"Here I sat broken hearted....

Seller had no idea it was even there and was shocked (she had lived there for 15years).  My inspector and realtor confirmed that it was almost certainly a cistern due to the location relative to the house and the style of house.  The water is either from an active drainage pipe or from seeping groundwater.  The inspector is coming back for free next week to give it a look but isn't too worried.  He said lots of houses in the area have them and are easy to manage and rarely cause damage from the moisture.  I'll keep updating if I get more pictures!\n\n***2nd Edit***\nIt's a cistern from the 1800s; I pumped out the 4ft of water and paid some guys to shovel out the gunk at the bottom.  No treasure but also nothing gross except for some very old mouse skulls.  No more water has come in and it's actually drying out pretty well despite the warm wet weather.  This summer I plan to get down there and shovel out the remaining dirt.  The writing on the wall also has a date that was under the water level: 1914.",

When we first looked at it after they left we thought it looked alright, but when we saw the carpet in the light of day we noticed things we hadn't before that made us kind of unhappy  \n-We found potato chips on the newly installed carpet in one bedroom  \n-some of the seams were really well done, and others look horrible and as if the two pieces of carpet are barely touching  \n-they put a seam in the middle of one of the landings on the stairs  \n-you can feel all the tack strips going up the stairs and through the hallway  \n-they broke a piece off of the bottom of a baluster  \n-we just noticed yesterday (so we haven't had a chance to talk to the contractor about it yet) that there are gouges a few mm deep going up every stair from either the removal or installation  \n[seam] (https://imgur.com/iLd5s63)  \n[bottom of baluster](https://imgur.com/V8OOIDe)  \n[gouges in stringer part of stairs (wood)](https://imgur.com/uI3jZM8)  \n[gouges next to wood stringer in drywall](https://imgur.com/a/5cZRKRa)  \n[found before pic of stairs](https://imgur.com/a/w2VOSif)  \nBefore we noticed the gouges in the wall, we had the contractor over and expressed how unhappy we were with some areas of installation of the carpet. He kept telling us that the seams were normal (despite some of them being beautifully done, demonstrating that the men who installed the carpet knew how to do a carpet seam, but essentially just got lazy), but he could have the installer back over to \"see if anything can be done to make it look better\". He did agree that the seam in the middle of the landing was not acceptable and that would have to be fixed.  \nHe said the only thing that could be done about the baluster was he takes that piece off and sands it down, but because it's a pretty deep break he'll have to sand down all four sides and it won't match the rest of the balusters  \nHe said the tack strips poking through is completely normal and that the only thing that can be done is to hammer down any that are troublesome. We know that is not correct and we told him we disagreed.     \nWe found the gouges in the wall yesterday afternoon when the light was hitting it just right; they are on the wall under every stair and when you get to the top of the stairs on the side wall there are gauges and scratches there as well     \nWe spoke to our realtor and he said that he thinks we should have a flooring professional come out and say what's been done incorrectly and what needs to be fixed and that will have to be done at the cost of the contractor, which is great - if the contractor agrees to it, which it sounds like anything he's willing to fix he's trying to do the cheapest way possible. My mom said after the flooring professional comes out and see what has been done, we could file a claim with the contractor's insurance  \nIf he's saying he doesn't see anything wrong with the install or the tacks, how is this something that we can get fixed without having to pay for another full carpet installation? Would it be that simple to file a claim with his insurance?    \nedit:spelling  \n  \n  \nupdate: I don't know if anyone will check back, but I wanted to write an update without making a new post.  \nWe had called a flooring professional and he came out yesterday evening and spent about an hour inspecting everything. He was incredible generous of his time and did it free of charge.  \nHe said the gouges in the wall were from them just being lazy with the nail gun  \nHe agreed that the seam in the landing was not correct and needs to be fixed  \nWe thought that had used a seam sealer, but he said they did not  \nHe told us the carpet was not stretched nearly tight enough and has way too much give and will eventually start bunching up  \nand he said the reason the tacks are coming through is, as everyone has said, because the carpet is thin. We were surprised to hear him say that because our contractor insisted it would be really high quality carpet, but it's just a mid-grade, nothing special  \nHe said the reason some of the seams look so terrible is because those are the seams where one side of the carpet was cut with the grain and the other is against it.  \nHe basically told us it was a really sloppy install job and that overall the work is pretty unacceptable  \nWe are going to come up with a game plan this weekend for how to approach our contractor.

    "post_text": "I'm a first time home owner and my parents never owned a home so I'm not sure what the proper etiquette is when it comes to tree trimming. My next door neighbor has a tree that is hanging over my property and the branches are damaging the roof of my shed. \n\nNow my neighbor and I don't really get along. When we first moved in he was parking a large commercial trailer directly in-front of my house. When i asked him if he could park it somewhere else he basically told me he can park anywhere he wants and i can go f##k myself. So i started parking one of my cars in that spot so he could not. This was a little over a year ago and we have had zero interactions since this. \n\nAm I supposed to, or should I, ask him to trim the tree? Is it not proper etiquette if I just trim what's on my side without saying anything to him? I don't look forward to any conversation with him as he's a redneck and seems to have a short fuse. ",

    "title": "Mostly-DIY Kitchen Project Cosmetic Upgrade! Before/After Pics, Process, and Details with Budget ($4,500) Included.",
    "post_text": "**TL;DR:** Originally, we were planning to do a small kitchen upgrade and just replace the ugly vinyl flooring and hallway carpet. Pretty quickly, we decided if we were going to do the work, we may as well do it all! It took about two months to complete and approximately $4,500 - cosmetic, no cabinets/plumbing/structural changes.\u00a0Upper Midwest.\n\n[You can find all the images here, including before/after and process.](https://imgur.com/a/28O6Bw2)\n\n**Some background:** Our house was built in 1927, but appears to have been flipped sometime in the early 2000s.... a DIY flip where they ran out of money in the middle, according to our neighbors. We have done a bunch of projects, but usually my dad helps out (he\u2019s a great woodworker and engineer). This was our first totally independent project, with some FaceTime support for questions and some borrowed tools. When we bought the house three years ago, we decided it\u2019s an 8ish year house, so all projects we do with that in mind.\n\nIt all started with a random Friday night when I asked my husband if he would help me rip up the carpet in the hallway....\n\nAfter ripping up the carpet, we had grand plans to sand/refinish the floors underneath. Luckily we had my dad come to lend us his sander and he told us the black mastic was probably full of asbestos (clearly someone had removed old tile in the 80s (?) then just laid carpet on top). We got some quotes for asbestos removal and refinishing and quickly decided it was not worth it and just put a new subfloor over the hallway. This also was a good choice because it made the kitchen, bathroom, and hallway all the same height. We assume they had done something similar in the kitchen, but decided to cover the tile/asbestos glue with subfloor instead of carpeting. It was our first time independently laying subfloor, and went surprisingly well - despite the stupid corners that we fixed before we put down flooring. We used a circular saw and a straightedge to cut, this was before we had a workbench so it kind of sucked. We lived with the subfloor only for a few months as we figured out what to do with the rest of the kitchen.\n\n**Cabinet decisions/process:** We actually like our cabinets size/orientation and were a big reason we bought the house. For a small kitchen, they really utilized the space well for storage while maximizing counter space. We went back and forth between whether to paint or not paint. Our dream kitchens all have beautiful wood cabinets. Our kitchen had wood cabinets that we saw at Menards while picking up quarter round. So, we decided to paint them. We researched paints and colors and eventually decided on a [Benjamin Moore](https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/interior-exterior-paints-stains/how-to-advice/interiors/paint-kitchen-cabinets) paint. The bottoms are Tarrytown Green and the tops are Chantilly Lace. We considered blue, but then when we showed a sample my husband\u2019s family all said \u201cI thought you were choosing green.\u201d and we landed back on green. We regret all of our paint choices!! Not the colors, we love those, but the paint itself. It ran all over the place, randomly dripped, and was generally hard to work with. All the trim in our house is Sherwin Williams Emerald Enamel Trim Paint and now that we\u2019ve used something else, realize that paint is totally worth the absurd pricing. We only chose Benjamin Moore because we couldn\u2019t find a green we liked at Sherwin. The actual process was fine, the usual sand/prime/sand/paint/sand/paint/wait forever/install.\u00a0 We kept our hardware since we liked it, and installed soft close door hinges (never going back!)\n\n**Countertop decisions/process:** Originally, we wanted a butcher block. My husband bakes a lot of bread, and we decided that doing quartz would just generally be easier for flour cleanup. Our local friends had a good experience with IKEA, so we decided to do that. AND they were running a 15% off countertops so we could spring for the better looking ones. The whole process was super slick! You choose and purchase at IKEA, with a close estimate of the price. IKEA subcontracts to a local company who takes it from there. They were fast, communicative, did good measurements, fabricated in about two weeks, and installed in an hour, including the under mount sink. I\u2019ve heard some horror stories on the internet, so it\u2019s good if you\u2019re considering IKEA custom quartz countertops to get a local friend\u2019s experience. We disposed of our old countertops via a \u201cfree\u201d sign in our yard and a FB marketplace post. The person who picked them up said they use them for his Habitat for Humanity (ish, can\u2019t remember the company) homes in Guatemala.\n\n**Sink/faucet:** My husband loved spending forever looking at sinks and faucets. We don\u2019t have much space so choices were limited! We love a large, single sink. The touch less feature on the faucet sucked so we turned it off (less water pressure, slower). Next time we\u2019d get the cheap regular faucet, same style. We ended up getting the [Kraus Dual Mount Drop-In Sink](https://www.kraususa.com/kraus-kht411-25-25in-dual-mount-drop-in-stainless-steel-2-hole-single-bowl-kitchen-sink.html) and the [Kraus Bolden Touchless Sensor Faucet](https://www.kraususa.com/touchless-sensor-single-handle-18-inch-commercial-pull-down-kitchen-faucet-in-matte-black.html).\u00a0\n\n**Demo:** We were prepped with drywall to fix the backsplash drywall post demo. As we started, we quickly realized it was actually just peel and stick tile - who knew that existed?!? So that ended up being super easy and immediately made the space look better. The vinyl flooring went quickly once we started. The cat hated the residual glue on the floor and it was hilarious.\u00a0\n\n**Flooring decisions/process:** This was another go-back-and-forth decision, if you\u2019ve noticed the trend... We originally wanted Marmoleum. We installed sheet Marmoleum in our mudroom and it is our favorite floor. It was a pain to install though, so we had already decided we would hire out if we did Marmoleum. Since the rest of our house is blonde original hardwood, we didn\u2019t want something that would look too similar to the rest of the house since we knew it would be a lot of work to get a perfect match. We ruled out tile flooring since we already had a 3/8inch difference in flooring heights and weren\u2019t looking to have a tile hallway. We eventually landed on doing Cali Bamboo flooring, in [Aged Amber GeoWood](https://www.calibamboo.com/product-aged-amber-medium-brown-hardwood-floors-7204006501.html) since it claims to be easy to install and also waterproof. We laid the flooring ourselves using the Cali underlayment. It was a pain to cut since it was a limestone core, but eventually we got the hang of using a jigsaw for weird parts. We blew through a bunch of blades. We used a mitre for the straight cuts. We ended up flooring in the bathroom too, to get rid of the ugly vinyl. It looks good, but we wouldn\u2019t do it again. It\u2019s already coming apart in places despite our best efforts. It would have worked better with a rubber mallet and an s-bracket to tighten them up even more in the hallway. A floating floor is weird. We prefer hardwood, and if we were to do it again we would just get the hardwood we actually want. Even good looking engineered isn\u2019t the same as real wood. We still think we made the right choice for the space, function, and time in our lives.\u00a0\n\n**Backsplash decisions/process:** This one was easy. Dream handmade local tile is not for an 8-year house and subway tile is unbelievably cheap and easy to install for your first time. We used a tile cutter and an angle grinder to do the outlets, installed in a day. Used info from here to help out, as well as internet searching for the best way to lay tile backsplash. My husband also researched grout forever - we wanted a light grout but did not want all the work of light grout. We do not like the dark grout + subway. We ended up with [Platinum grout](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Custom-Building-Products-Polyblend-115-Platinum-10-lb-Non-Sanded-Grout-PBG11510/202647231) and it was the right choice for us. Reaffirmed I hate all concrete work, grouting included. But it looks good! We cut out around our magnetic knife strip, which was a great idea because now knives aren\u2019t hanging on the wall by our back door.\u00a0\n\n**Thresholds:** My dad made us maple thresholds for Christmas, custom sized to our transitions. I stained and polyurethaned them. The staining was annoying because it was spotted all over the place (I didn\u2019t use a wood conditioner the first time). So, I had to re-sand all of them then wood condition and stain. A short project became a long annoying project... oh well!\u00a0\n\n**Undermount lighting:**\u00a0 My husband also was obsessed with undermount lighting, and researched a bunch before going with the [Philips LED strip](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/products/smart-lightstrips), plugged in with our microwave.\n\n**Finishing:** We finished it all up with installing some quarter round, painting trim, and installing thresholds! And lots of caulking! And a new light fixture from [Olde Brick Lighting on Etsy](https://oldebricklighting.com)! The walls are all Alabaster by Sherwin Williams.\u00a0\n\n**Order of Operations:**\n\n1. Rip up carpet, lay subfloor in hallway\n2. Paint walls\n3. Paint cabinets/demo backsplash\u00a0\n4. Install countertops\n5. Lay flooring\n6. Do backsplash\n7. Finish/thresholds/trim\n\n**Budget-ish ($4500):**\n\n* Subfloor: $50\n* 2 gallons paint: $100\n* Soft close hinges: $200\n* Countertops + install: $2,400\n* Flooring: $700\n* Light fixture: $200 (or $400 if you count the first light we bought, installed, and hated)\n* Sink/Faucet: $500\n* Backsplash: $150\n* Other: $200\n* Thresholds: gift\n\n**If we were going to do it all again:**\n\n* (Opinion) Use real hardwood floors/never install laminate or engineered unless it\u2019s your basement\u00a0\n* Touchless sensor faucet isn\u2019t worth it\n* Use Sherwin Williams Emerald trim paint\n* Kitchens need light! We ordered a cool stained glass Tiffany light... looked great BUT gave off no light, even with 2X100W bulbs.\u00a0\n* Use an angle grinder the whole time for cutting tile. We used a jigsaw for a while and it sucked. Alternatively, ask your friend their opinion because turns out they had a wet saw you could have borrowed this whole time...\u00a0\n* Grouting is a two person job to clean/sponge if you're a first-timer. Make a plan before you start and both watch the same YouTube video! We did not and ended up yelling \u201cno not like that diagonal you\u2019re removing all the grout\u201d while making a mess.\n* Mitre corners when you are awake and fresh. The first time we tried doing quarter round we were too tired from laying flooring and just cut all these random pieces until we ran out of quarter round and nothing fit together anywhere. Then we stopped, ordered pizza, cleaned up and immediately fell asleep.\u00a0\n\n**Working with your partner on DIY:**\n\n* Doing your own research is good, but... make sure you come together and talk about it before you start. AKA watch the same YouTube videos or read some of the same articles. With so many different ways to do things, you can both be right but also be trying to use two different techniques.\u00a0\u00a0We may have done this and then finally figured it out by the end of the project.\n\nIf you made it to the end... congrats! Thanks for reading!\u00a0Hope this helps someone!",

    "post_text": "I want to put a couple of steel pad eyes on the ceiling (in my house) to hang a trapeze bar that is made for a kids' swing.  The first pad eyes I got would only take no bigger than a #10 screw.  So I put them up, carefully, two 2 1/2\" #10 screws in each pad eye, 16\" apart (as that is the width of of the bar) through the drywall ceiling into the ceiling joist overhead.  These were your \"common\" zinc-plated, shiny steel screws that you get at all the home improvement and hardware stores.  No question: they were snug and firmly set into the middle of the edge of the 2X8 overhead.  btw, it's not going to be used as a \"trapeze\"--just as a \"grab  bar\" over an exercise platform I have beneath it.\n\nI hung the trapeze bar, everything looked fine.  I moved the ladder and got down on the floor to adjust the location of the exercise machine slightly.  Getting up, I reached up for the bar as an assist. I put very little weight on it--maybe 20% of my weight.  I didn't get a knee six inches off the floor before all four of those screws simultaneously sheared off at the point where the unthreaded neck meets the threads, and the whole thing came crashing  down.  No damage, I wasn't hurt.  But it seems like that should not have happened.  \n\nMy question is, do you have an inherent weak spot in the screws when you put a long screw like that through drywall into a joist or stud?  Note that the pad eyes themselves did not fail and the entire threaded portion of all four screws is still firmly embedded in the wooden joist above. And the length of the unthreaded shanks that broke off is just about the same as the thickness of the drywall. And they all broke simultaneously and completely at the same exact point--right where the unthreaded shank meets the threads.  I have ordered some larger pad eyes that take a #14 screw and will span the area where those other four are embedded.  What are my chances?  Any help would be appreciated.",

It definitely spread quite a bit, because there are two patches in the drywall that were invisible before that are now obvious, and the seams of at least two sheets of drywall are showing/swollen with water. We\u2019ve already put the business\u2019s insurance in touch with our homeowner\u2019s insurance, and my boyfriend does all the IT for this company, so I\u2019m not worried about them trying to screw us over, I\u2019m more just looking to see how long I should except repairs to take, what the potential repairs might be, etc. TYIA!",

    "post_text": "Thought I would share our before and after kitchen renovation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://imgur.com/gallery/F65QrXq](https://imgur.com/gallery/F65QrXq)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't go into a ton of detail but I'm happy to answer any questions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackstory:\n\nWe bought a home that was in bad shape. It was a short sale after the owner rented it to someone who subsequently rented it to someone else. Original owner needed to sell the place and the renters were very upset so they damaged the house. Holes in the walls, gas on the carpet and in the toilets, countertops cracked, sink faucets broken, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Edit:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry, left out some info I needed for the rules.\n\n* The floor is laminate and I would do it again. It was a cost effective option and we've liked it.\n* The countertops are quartz. We chose these over granite for maintenance reasons. To be honest, I don't know that they're so maintenance free, as we have gotten a stain, but that could've been more user error than anything else. We also did not like the countertop company we worked with at all and had multiple problems with them so that could be part of it.\n* We did an undercount sink to be able to easily wash big dishes and it is my favorite and I'll never go back to a double sink. I love it so much.\n* The appliances are all Samsung. We like them okay but the letters have peeled off all of the appliances.\n* Would have preferred a counter depth fridge to fit better but because I own a food website, I often need a lot of food in the house so this just made more sense for our personal needs.\n* I also would've preferred to have a dedicated hood above the range and a separate microwave but for this space, the microwave as a hood over the range made more sense.\n* This is not our forever home. It's actually on the market right now. So we made a lot of decisions for resale purposes but also knowing that we didn't want to spend too much money knowing we'd be out quickly. We bought the home in 2015.\n* To save money, we bought the faucet and the cabinet handles on Amazon instead of one of the big box stores.\n\nWe wanted the kitchen to be light and bright to make up for the small space. Luckily, we get tons of natural light from the garden window which helps brighten up the space considerably.\n\nTotal cost was under $10k:\n\npainting cabinets: $200\n\ncountertop with sink: $3800\n\nappliances: $4k\n\nfaucet: $150\n\ncabinet handles: under $100\n\nHard to say what flooring was exactly since we did the entire house at once.",

    "post_text": "Moved into our fixer-upper the last day in July. We knew it needed a lot of work. But of course turns out it needs A LOT of work. We live in the northeast and it is currently below freezing and will be for a while. Finally scrounged up enough money to get our attic insulated, at the cost of putting our water heater on the back burner. T \\_T Got a few estimates and they were triple what we were thinking they would be because the insulation up there is potentially moldy so they need fix the vents, seal it, take out the old stuff, sanitize, vacuums, then install the new stuff. Hilariously the previous homeowners replaced the roof last year but didn't do the insulation that is basically nothing. However I have an even more ridiculous find! The guy giving us an estimate today sent us photos he took. Turns out the previous home owners did install new insulation... on like 2% of the attic.... [For your visual enjoyment](https://imgur.com/a/G8LlGAg). Feel free to laugh-cry with me.\n\nFor those concerned about me getting tricked into taking out the old insulation, the photo only show like 10% of the attic. Other portions show water damage, have literally 0 insulation, or the insulation is moldy and black. Just uploaded this one because I thought it was funny the previous owner did some of it at all but then didn\u2019t finish the job.",

    "post_text": "So.  I'm going to share with you all an episode of \"DIY home improvement with Moteefs\"\n\nOn today's episode, re-installing the toilet, following new floor tile installation.  \n\nStep 1:  clean all the old wax ring residue off the toilet base.  This is dirty, gross, and sticky.  It will make your tools dirty, and hands impossible to wash completely.  \n\nStep 2:  drive to Rural King to buy replacement wax ring.  While there, look at guns, etc.  Temporarily forget why you went to Rural King.  Eventually remember why you're there.  Look at wax rings and convince yourself they are inadequate in size to ensure the job is completed to your satisfaction.  Leave Rural King without wax ring.  Be sure and buy some other junk while there. \n\nStep 3:  the next day, drive to Menard's. Buy a new wax ring.  Don't settle for the cheap ones, they are obviously inferior.  Instead, opt for the $5.99 one because it must be the best.  While there, be sure and buy other random things that you don't really need.  \n\nStep 4:  drive home. \n\nStep 5:  install wax ring onto bottom of toilet.  Place toilet into position CAREFULLY to ensure wax ring is damage free and perfectly located to guarantee a perfect seal.\n\nStep 6:  Notice that the bolts protruding through the holes are now too short, as apparently the thickness of the new tiles have rendered them useless.  \n\nStep 7:  remove toilet and scrape now useless (and previously perfect $5.99 wax ring) from bottom of toilet and throw into trash.  Repeat step 1 with regards to dirty tools and hands that are impossible to wash. \n\nStep 8:  Cuss a little.  \n\nStep 9:  think how \"this would never happen to dad\" and cry a little.  \n\nStep 10:  Drive back to Menard's quickly before they close.  Buy another wax ring but this time settle for the $3.99 version, because who needs those fancy $5.99 ones anyway.  Also, spend 10 minutes reviewing the vast options in toilet bolts available to purchase until you decide which ones are going to be \"the best\".  While there, be sure and buy even more random things that you don't really need.\n\nStep 11:  Return home and install new bolts.  This time, check height of bolts prior to installing wax ring on toilet to ensure proper fit.  \n\nStep 12:  Install new wax ring.\n\nStep 13:  Install toilet over newly installed (and height verified) bolts.  Once happy with perfect location, use body weight to compress new wax ring into place. \n\nStep 14:  Place washers over bolts and attempt to place nut over washer.  Realize washers are too small and cuss a little at the manufacturer of your new \"perfect bolts\".  \n\nStep 15:  Go to garage to forage for better sized washers. \n\nStep 16:  On way to garage, remember that you forgot to remove the rag from the drain opening before you placed the toilet with $3.99 wax ring into perfect location.  Swiftly collapse on floor and cry a little.\n\nStep 17:  Devise a plan to proceed with plan to find washers, bolt down toilet, and then remove the rag later with a pipe snake.  This will prevent yet another trip to Menard's (since they are closed) to buy yet another wax ring priced from $3.99-5.99.  \n\nStep 18:  Find suitable washer combination and proceed to bolt down toilet.  \n\nStep 19:  admire your brilliance in action whilst you tighten nuts/bolts.  (Of course, it would have been better to remove the rag prior to placing the toilet, but you like the challenge this pipe snake adventure will lead.)\n\nStep 20:  Carefully tighten nuts - but not too tight. \n\nStep 21:  Listen with glee as you over tighten nuts and hear toilet crack.  \n\nStep 22:  Start online shopping for new toilet.\n\nStep 23:  Cry a little at the prices of toilets.",

What I'm concerned about is damage to the painting if it falls. I notice quite a few reviews on Amazon saying how the strips failed to work.\n\nI was thinking about placing corner bumper guards/protectors around the two lower edges of the frame, to protect the piece in the event that it fell to the hardwood floor below, but am not sure that this would protect the piece completely from damage.\n\nThe painting was created about a century ago by an artist who was a family friend. It is not of great material value but in terms of sentimental value, it is irreplaceable, so I would like to minimize the possibility of damage. Any suggestions as to how to achieve this (how to ensure that command strips don't fail, perhaps, or more reliable alternatives?) would be most appreciated.",

    "title": "Just completed a full house reno over 10 months",
    "post_text": "[https://imgur.com/a/F2F2wcY](https://imgur.com/a/F2F2wcY)\n\nWe bought this house last June and after 10 months we are done! The house had been a rental for most of its life and was aesthetically extremely rough.\n\nFirst thing we did was cover up all the beige paint with Elemental from Home Depot prior to tearing out the old floors. This way we didn't have to worry about paint drops or spills.\n\nStarting with the kitchen, we cut out the drywall that the old tile backsplash was on, hung new drywall and installed a mosaic tile backsplash using Mussel Bound adhesive mat. While we had the old backsplash and drywall out, I flipped the switch for the pantry light from outside the pantry to inside the pantry. Since the door hinges on the side that the lightswitch was on, if you opened the door before turning on the light, you had to close the door again to reach the switch. Not well thought out. My wife painted the cabinets and I installed a new dishwasher. We contracted the Quartz countertops and extended the overhang for the bar by about 6 inches and had the counterop guys install a single-basin undermount sink. I put in the faucet and a new garbage disposal and reran the plumbing to go from double-basin to single. easy enough to do but working with PVC solvent under the cabinet gave me a headache. We replaced all the hinges and drawer sliders with soft close ones. Shortly after, the bottoms of some of the drawers started falling out. Turns out, the old sliders mounted on the bottom also supported the drawer bottoms. When we changed the sliders to the new side-mounted ones the little staples couldn't hold on. I glued them back on and secured them with small screws and they've been great since.\n\nI ripped up all the nasty old carpet that had been there since the house was built in the early 2000s. Upstairs, I installed Pergo Outlast Plus laminate after pulling out all the staples, screwing down the subfloor to fix squeaks, and pulling off the baseboards. Since we were living in the house, I did one room at a time and saved the hallway between them for last. This meant I had to put in T-molds at all of the door ways. If I were doing it again I would start in one corner of one room and do the entire thing as one unit to eliminate the transitions, but I guess this way there is more room for expansion. I got a cordless oscillating multi tool to cut around the door casings where I needed to and to make the small cuts around closet shelves, doorways, and HVAC registers.\n\nIn the walk-out basement, I installed Shaw LVP due to past water intrusion. I traced the source of the water to a poorly routed sump discharge and gutter downspout that drained right next to the foundation and uphill from the basement door. Water was pooling by the door and coming in during heavy rainfall. To fix that problem I ran 40 feet of drain pipe from the downspout out into the yard in a hand dug trench and tied the sump discharge into it. I also cut out the basement door threshhold and replaced it. Problem solved.\u00a0\n\nI replaced all of the ceiling fans except for the living room, and all all of the light fixtures. Again, straight forward other than one upstairs hall light where I had to put in a new box to lower it about 1/2 an inch so the light base would sit flush against the ceiling.\u00a0\n\nThe guest bathroom and laundry room upstairs got LVT floors. The guest bathroom had some rotten subfloor that I cut out and replaced and a new toilet flange. I also replaced the vanity and added a sliding shower door. Previously there had just been a curtain which is why the subfloor was rotten.\u00a0 One thing to watch out for with vanities that I learned is to check where the existing plumbing comes out of the wall. On mine it was too low for the integrated shelf in the new vanity so I had to notch it to make it fit.\u00a0\n\nThe final project was the master bath. I took out the old linoleum and vanity and put in marble LVT and a new 72\u201d granite top vanity. I measured the vanity at the base and marked it out on the floor so I could lay the tile perfectly up to the base. Other than replacing leaky shutoffs this went without a hitch. I found it easier to cut the tile with the multi tool instead of a utility knife. I replaced the toilet and then ripped out the old shower insert while my wife painted the tub. For the new shower I went with a delta 3-piece system. With that in, straight forward according to the instructions, I replaced the drywall up to the new surround and used Trim Tec shower bead to get a crisp mud line before sealing with silicone. I hung new mirrors from Lowes, but didn't trust the single screw hanging point that came with it so I put a few healthy gobs of construction adhesive on the backs to keep them in place. Due to time constraints I contracted the shower door.\u00a0 The access doors for the tub motor had busted hinges and we had trouble finding new ones that worked so I used a small bead of silicone to glue them to the surround. If they need to come off in the future for maintenance, it shouldn't take more than a razor blade to free them.\n\nCosts (approximate):\nCounters- $3k\nKitchen faucet - $180\nCabinet Hinges and sliders - $200\nBacksplash tile/mat/grout- $250\nBasement LVP - $1k\nPergo laminate - $2,500\nLVT- $300\nDelta 3-piece shower and pan - $450\n72\u201d vanity - $800\nMirrors - 2x$80\nToilet - $180\nMaster bath shower door-$800\nGuest vanity - $180\nGuest shower door (delta) - $550\nPaint and rollers- $400\nFans and lights - $1,000\nBaseboards and quarter round -$300\nCaulk/adhesive/etc - $150\nWood/drywall - $100\nPlumbing bits - $100\n\nTotal cost: ~$13,500",

    "post_text": "My wife and I have been renovating our 1920's home and decided that our nearly 100 year old slate roof should be replaced. There were signs of leaking when we bought the house and we knew it would need replaced at some point. We opted to go with a high end metal roof with a reputable company, it was pricey, but we wanted a product that would last.  The demolition and install have taken over 4 weeks now and we had fairly significant water damage inside the house during this process. Needless to say we've been a bit frustrated with the company and process (they did say they would pay for all damage/restoration to the interior of the house because the damage was their fault). Yesterday they dropped off the paperwork while we were out saying the job was done, but I already noticed they didn't install the ridge vent or solar fan that we paid for. In walking around the house I found other issues, but I'm not sure if I'm just being overly picky at this point out of frustration. Any advice on this stuff?\n\nI should mention that every roofer that looked at the house mentioned how it's a difficult roof on an old house. I had trouble even getting pictures while hanging out windows.\n\n[pictures of the roof](https://imgur.com/gallery/a2xW2iS)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: \n\nI did speak with the company and they're sending out someone to check out my concerns. The roof is a steel product coated in granite and slate. He said that the gaps on the hips are due to the rigidity of the product but that it's been sealed up under. They also claim that the flashing around the dormers, chimney, and in the valley's are just there for aesthetics but that a traditional drip pan is under it. (I do now recall seeing more traditional flashing on the cheeks of the dormers before install).  We're going to have another local company that installs a similar product come by for a second opinion. ",

    "title": "Love my new house but it smells \"old\"",
    "post_text": "I closed on this house on 9/30 and I love it. I did a very risky thing and waived inspection (in my area this summer, any offer that didn't waive was thrown out immediately, due to how hot it was; still not a good idea, but I'm on a 13-month lease and didn't want to put off this part of my life another whole year so I made an admittedly unwise gamble), but luckily the inspectors said the house was in great condition with a list of very minor things, none very urgent. I'm confident the inspection was good as the company is very reputable. Some contractors I've had in to quote fixes of some of the minor issues have expressed surprise that they were even noticed, so I suspect the inspectors nitpicked about as good as I could ask for. Anyway...\n\nIt has old-house smell. And when I come back to my apartment (not moving in until end of the month) my clothes still smell like the house, even if I haven't leaned against a wall or touched anything. I know \"old house smell, what do I do\" is a common question here, and I have searched for it and read most of the results, but I have seen so many different answers that I feel overwhelmed. I'm very good at things that have clearly defined steps, which is why a lot of home DIY projects appeal to me, because not only are there clear codes to follow but the Internet has tutorials for everything. But something as vague as \"fix this smell in the house\" is too open-ended and my brain wants to quit on me. But I want to get this fixed, so in the interest of working with my own brain I am hoping I can get together a kind of clear checklist of things to go through to help identify it. I'm going to list off some things I have seen that I think may be relevant to other threads I've seen on this--if you want to tailor your answer to that, great! I appreciate that. **But I know I have issues being concise, so if you have more general ideas and want to skip the following list I will not be offended.**\n\n- The house is built in the 1950's. It's mostly over a basement but there is one small section in the back that is a crawlspace with access from inside the basement. Inspector said moisture wasn't a problem in the crawl space but that I should consider hanging a computer fan in the entrance just to circulate air, in case that isn't the case year-round.\n- The basement also smells musty, but in a bit of a different way. I don't know how to describe it other than it has old-house smell with a slight undertone very similar to that blue cleaner used in public restrooms--kind of vaguely sweet, I guess? I couldn't smell that undertone until I just happened to go down there while wearing a mask, which blocked the main musty smell but kept the pseudo-sweet smell. Now that I *know* it's there I can pick it out but that's how slight it is. That one is mainly near the front where there is just a concrete wall with relatively new wood studs over it. No drywall, wood is fine. However the inspection report said there were signs of moisture infiltration via the concrete wall on that side of the basement, which the inspector hypothesized was due to some minor issues in the grading around the house, but he said it was minor enough that it probably only becomes an issue during particularly heavy rain.\n- My radon report was between 46% and 48% humidity in the basement throughout the entire duration of the 51 hour test. It was at 48% the *vast* majority of the time. My understanding is that between 30% and 50% should be ideal, so should I take this to mean that basement humidity shouldn't be my first suspect in narrowing down this smell? I keep intending to get a big tub of DampRid down there while I shop for a dehumidifier for the crawl space but I honestly forget to buy it every time I'm out.\n- I hear attic insulation can cause this smell. I haven't been in the attic yet because attics skeeve me out as a result of a chronic bat problem my family had when I was a young kid, and I've only been over to the house alone so far, but once we move in I'll have someone accompany me and check it out. The inspectors said it has loose-fill insulation and that there was evidence that moisture had gotten in in the past, but had clearly been remediated. I might have someone in to replace the insulation in the spring because from what I've read it should only be a couple grand at most.\n- There's carpet in a bunch of places in the house, primarily the entire upstairs and the front half of the house. There used to be carpet on the stairs but I noticed there were decent wood treads underneath so I have already ripped that out. I'm going to have *all* the carpet taken out eventually (I will keep the upstairs as being carpeted, but I'm completely ripping it out and replacing it once I can afford to; downstairs will eventually be switched to wood).\n- The garage smells exactly the same as the house does. There's no drywall or anything, just studs and plywood, all of which looks fine, not moldy, to my layman's eye.\n- There is one spot in my living room where there's a slight yellow spot on the ceiling. It's definitely a water stain, but I don't know how old, and I don't know what from. The inspectors said that it looks dry now but they couldn't really say more. I think they told me they usually suspect an upstairs bathroom leak with something like that, but either I misheard or they just meant in general, because my upstairs bathroom isn't near there; I actually don't think that specific spot has anything but roof above it.\n- There isn't any other obvious place where there may have been a water leak. Under the sink is bone dry with no evidence of water damage, and I'm not sure what I could look for in other places short of taking whole sections down to the studs and replacing the drywall (which is neither hard nor expensive, just... annoying enough that it's not my first choice).\n\nFor anyone who read all that, thanks so much. I hope someone can help me out.",

    "post_text": "First time single family home buyer here. I had spent the past twenty years living in a condo, and relying on the building's maintenance supervisor to do the odd little jobs here and there for me as needed. But the reality is that condo life is pretty maintenance free - or at least it was in mine. Obviously, I won't have such access when I move in to my new home, which is also in another town altogether where I don't yet know anybody. I'm hoping to learn to DIY to keep up with home maintenance stuff and save some money. I own a toolbox, but honestly, I am so green (like, I know how to use a hammer and nails to hang up art and whatnot, but that's it, as embarrassed as I am to admit this publicly). What are your fav YouTube pages that have helped you learn how to do things right the first time?",

    "post_text": "[https://imgur.com/a/Q0T95wN](https://imgur.com/a/Q0T95wN)\n\nFor context: I don't know if I consider myself \"handy\".  Just a 20-something computer nerd who can google search effectively and follow directions.  I grew up in apartments and small townhouses so I've never really had a workspace or garage to get work done.  The only relevant experience I've had was helping my uncle lay vinyl plank flooring and refinish bathroom cabinets the year prior. \n\nmoved back in with my parents in 2020 to help out around the house and attempt to save some money.  2021 rolls around and the market was much more insane than I thought it would be.  Being the value-driven person I am, I thought I had found a great \"deal\" when pursuing current condo.\n\nIt's a 2br2ba 1300sqft that was going for the same price as a 1br1ba 800sqft in the same building.  It had been on the market for more than a couple weeks (places were under contract within a week at that point) and when I toured it I saw why.  All original 1970s everything, poorly maintained and some seriously janky handyman work spread out.  The only update was just kitchen appliances 6 or so years ago.  \n\nMy girlfriend was not on board but I had delusions of grandeur coupled with a solid lack of patience.  An excellent base for beginning renovations.\n\nI moved in the day I got the keys and lived out of my roller luggage for the better part of the year.  Just wanted to get in and get work done at any chance I could get.  Also worth it to mention that I had also gotten a new job at the same time so incredibly stressful situations all around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**COST BREAKDOWN**\n\n*not-diy*\n\nYou could pretty much see where the studs were on every single wall and they all had large cracks.  It looked like drywall was one of the biggest things that people recommended having the pros do.  I had contractors come in and patch/paint everything as well as scrape the popcorn ceiling.\n\n|**Section**|**Item**|**Cost**|**Rolling Total**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Contractor pt 1**|Ceiling scrape/skim/paint|1,780||\n||Wall and Door Patch/Paint|1,360||\n||Architect Drawings|700||\n||**Section Total**|**3,840**|**3,840**|\n\nThe master bathroom had a tub + toilet that was closed off from the sink.  Sink and vanity sat outside door on top of carpet.  Carpet was not great.  We wanted to demo the wall separating the vanity + toilet and frame a new wall for a larger bathroom.\n\nWe had a small galley kitchen with french door entryway and pocket door exiting to a breakfast nook that had another set of french doors separating it from the living room.  I guess they wanted to keep the food smells contained.  We wanted to bring more light but not completely demoing the wall for an open kitchen because we thought we would need the cabinet space.\n\n|**Section**|**Item**|**Cost**|**Rolling Total**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Contractor pt 2**|Frame Bath Wall|1,200||\n||Demo Bath Wall|640||\n||Demo Kitchen Entry|880||\n||Demo Kitchen Pocket Door|550||\n||Demo Living Room Wall|680||\n||**Section Total**|**3,950**|**7,790**|\n\n**Would 100% have contractors do anything drywall-related again.  I can do small patches but you can tell which corner was the one I tried to skim.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*floor stuff*\n\nSpent a lot of time looking at floors.  I care a lot because I am always barefoot and like to exercise on bare floor.  I knew I wanted the click-lock planks because it had seemed so beginner-friendly.  Engineered hardwood was expensive and I wanted the extra hardness/durability because we were going to have dogs/cats + possible rental in the future.  My bathroom floors were home depot vinyl plank and I found it difficult to install as well as loud with the rubber mallet.  We went with Mohawk because I helped install when Costco had a deal.  Also did a ton of research on underlayment so the neighbors won't hear me romping around.\n\n|**Section**|**Item**|**Cost**|**Rolling Total**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Floors**|Mohawk Laminate Floor|3,792||\n||Matching Thresholds|339||\n||Underlayment|402||\n||Baseboard|170||\n||**Section Total**|**4,704**|**12,494**|\n\nThe floors took 3 months to arrive.  Install took about 3 weeks from delivery to final room.  I pushed the pace for the first week so that we could have a livable space and took another week off to work on other projects before finishing the final room\n\n**if I had to do this again I would take more time/hire someone to level the subfloor.  I only did this in one room but now that everything is installed, I can start to feel the dips.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*guest bathroom*\n\nThis was the first thing I started doing when I moved in on the first day.  Definitely had to replace the toilet.  Got the vanity from Ikea and shelves + mirror from amazon warehouse\n\n|**Section**|**Item**|**Cost**|**Rolling Total**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Guest Bathroom**|Vinyl Plank Floor|150||\n||Baseboard|21||\n||Kohler Toilet|180||\n||Vanity/Counter/Sink|486||\n||Shelves|89||\n||Vanity Mirror|103||\n||Medicine Cabinet|90||\n||**Section Total**|**1,119**|**13,613**|\n\ndid the install while the contractors were scraping the ceiling.

Prebuilt options were expensive.  Eventually, I caved and just got an IKEA wardrobe piece so I could stop living out of my luggage.  Tried planning out a custom 2-tiered rod system for hanging clothes.  Wood was expensive so I, once again, got an IKEA wardrobe set.\n\n|**Section**|**Item**|**Cost**|**Rolling Total**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Master Closet|Cabinet|286||\n||Shelf Racks|227||\n||Mirror|162||\n||Vinyl Plank Floor|227||\n||**Section Total**|**902**|**14,515**|\n\nI think this happened in the lull between contractors finishing up and the main floors being delivered.  We were sleeping on a blow-up mattress on concrete subfloor and it was nice to have an area where my things wouldn't be coated in dust.\n\n**no lessons learned here, sometimes ikea really is the cheapest option**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*kitchen*\n\none of my friends got me a good contractor rate for real wood cabinets.  They weren't the ultra-trendy style that I was chasing with some IKEA kitchen cabinets but they ended up being cheaper and free of any particleboard.  I got the light and faucet off amazon warehouse.  We got lucky with the sink and scooped it from IKEA as-is section for $20 (new was $242).  \n\nCountertops was a big point of contention for a while but at this point, we had just finished renovating everything else and fatigue had set in and stayed overtime.  Decided to just get some laminate from IKEA so I didn't have to wait and could just cut it on the spot.  My wallet was already bruised up and we  could always add quartz later\n\n|**Section**|**Item**|**Cost**|**Rolling Total**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Kitchen|Sink Faucet|164||\n||Sink|20||\n||Cabinets|4397||\n||Main Light|116||\n||Countertop|218||\n||**Section Total**|**4,751**|**19,266**|\n\nhope it's okay that I didn't finish.  I planned 7 months ago, took a break because of overspending, then waited 5 months for delivery.  Only the base cabinets were delivered with the wall cabinets back-ordered to an unknown date. \n\nCabinets were planned to deliver in November, I miscommunicated and they were delayed to December.  I took off work on the day that they were supposed to arrive and they came the day after.  So it took 3 days to get everything installed in between meetings.\n\n**the laser level was an absolute must.  black sink was worth it.  drawers are super cool but I am left wondering where I can put my larger appliances**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nmisc\n\nall other pieces not part of previous sections.  The light switches and receptacles was surprisingly expensive... especially the GFCI for the outdoor, kitchen, and bathrooms.  For some reason, the kitchen outlets were on like 3 separate runs.\n\n|**Section**|**Item**|**Cost**|**Rolling Total**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Misc|Hallway and Foyer Light|85||\n||Switches &amp; Receptacles|190||\n||Vents|50||\n||Ceiling Fan|130||\n||Door Knobs|100||\n||Living Room Curtain|30||\n||Bedroom Rod &amp; Curtain|70||\n||**Section Total**|**330**|**19,596**|\n\n**did I really have to replace all the switches/receptacles with black ones?  was it worth that much money?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*other stuff*\n\nso that's making the place functional and livable for under 20k.  I didn't include the master bathroom renovation details but I plan on adding shower door, fancy vanity light, electric toilet, etc.  We do have some other upcoming costs however...\n\n|Floor to Ceiling Window Replacement|Guest bedroom window|2,843|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n||Master bedroom window|5,895|\n||**Section Total**|**8,739**|\n\nThere was a group purchase hashed out for the building's windows.  Yes we're responsible for our own windows in this particular high-rise.  The windows were apparently leaking and soaking the carpet so the previous owners decided to caulk the track where the window opens... which blocks the drainage.  So now when it rains, water pools up and drips inside.\n\nThe HVAC works, it's just loud and ineffective.  Same with laundry but it sounds like a jet engine is just flowing through the entire unit.\n\n|HVAC|Whole Unit Replacement|\\~10,000|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Laundry|Washer/Dryer Combo|\\~1,500|\n||**Other Stuff Total**|**20,239**|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo that's it.  Pretty happy with what I got considering it cost as much as some people's bathroom renos.  Many thanks to amazon warehouse, IKEA, lazer levels, uncles, friends, patient girlfriends (now fiancee), internet resources etc.  Hope this helped someone out and happy to answer any questions",

    "title": "Toilet rocking after install; need to pull and redo?",
    "post_text": " tl;dr: Installed new toilet, which rocked slightly, even after tightening snug. Solved with shims after a few days, but I'm worried about the wax ring being compromised. Would you pull it and reinstall with a new ring?\n\nI just installed my first toilet, and everything went pretty smoothly with the installation, but the toilet rocks a little bit, even after tightening down the bolts quite a bit. I got then snug on the first day, and then kept tightening them 1/2 to 1 turn every day, whenever I'd sit on it and notice that it was still rocking. I got to the point where I got concerned about tightening them up any more, especially as the advice I've gotten online has essentially been, \"Just get then snug, and then 1/4 turn more\", and \"It's a feel and experience thing, and you won't really know where the limit is until you've broken your first one\". The first startment hasn't matched my limited personal experience, and the second one is not helpful as a first timer.\n\nI've picked up some shims since then, and that seems to have solved my problem. I also bought a tube of Polyseamseal, so I feel pretty confident about being able to stop the rocking and keeping everything solid now, but I'm worried about potential damage to the wax seal.\n\nThe flange was in pretty good shape when I pulled the old toilet. It was just above the tile floor, metal flange on ABS pipe, lots of wax and some rust, but I cleaned all that up and added some silicone to fill in the gaps between the outside of the flange and the tile in order to better keep any leaks at the surface. Even though it wasn't below the floor, I used an extra thick reinforced wax seal for some extra insurance ([https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-Extra-Thick-Reinforced-Toilet-Wax-Ring-with-Plastic-Horn-and-Zinc-Plated-Toilet-Bolts-004374/100211038](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-Extra-Thick-Reinforced-Toilet-Wax-Ring-with-Plastic-Horn-and-Zinc-Plated-Toilet-Bolts-004374/100211038)), along with real brass bolts, held upright with extra nuts.\n\nOverall, I feel pretty good about the seating of the toilet, and there have been no visible leaks yet, but now I'm worried about what might happen when there's a clog and water actually hangs out around the seal rather than just rushing down the pipe unimpeded.\n\nGiven that the rocking was probably only 1/4\" inch or less, and that there's been no leaking so far, would you personally feel confident in just shimming/caulking it and being done with it? Or would you pull it up and install a new ring in order to be 100% sure that wax wasn't overcompressed and the seal lost? This is on the ground floor, sitting on tile and a concrete slab, so there's really no serious damage that could happen by a leak. I also have a water leak sensor just behind the toilet, where I would leave a gap in the caulk in order to channel out any water.\n\nThank you very much for your advice! I'm open to any and all thoughts.",

    "title": "RENTAL HOUSE SMELLS LIKE PEE EVEN AFTER NEW CARPETS, KILZ AND PAINT. HELP!!!",
    "post_text": "My boyfriend and I got a rental house in November and after signing the lease, the furnace kicked on for the first time and we were overwhelmed with the smell of ammonia/animal urine. (Landlady said no cats have ever lived there, but it smells distinctly like cat pee. Apparently there was a ferret and dog there, could have been a ferret, idk, never had one) Using UV light we saw puddles of animal urine (glowing bright indicating it dried without past tenant cleaning) covering every square foot of carpeted area. The landlady agreed to pay for new carpets, and my uncle who is a contractor ripped out all carpets, put 2 coats of Kilz on the subfloors, and put new carpet in. Before new carpet, we scrubbed all the walls/ceilings, put kilz on all walls, and painted 2 coats of paint on all walls. We scrubbed every vent in the home with vinegar and enzyme cleaner, and used shop vac in all the vents, too. \n\nThe smell of urine has successfully been removed from every room except 1 of our 2 bedrooms. Once the new carpet smell faded, the room began to stink strongly of urine again. \n\nSo next, I used natures miracle enzyme spray all over the room (walls, floors) and paid special attention to the closet which smelled the most strong. The closet is made of wood, and after using UV light again, there is splatters of urine that glow under UV light that have remained present despite scrubbing the area many times with enzyme cleaner, vinegar, and a mix of hydrogen peroxide/soap, and using kilz/new paint. We even used an ozone machine in the room for a few days and the ozone machine removed stench from natures miracle, and the urine smell grows stronger by the day. We have closed the vent at this point and closed the room so the smell doesn't seep out. Many friends have verified the scent is overwhelmingly still present. \n\nMy boyfriend and I have spent over $1,000 on cleaning products for this house out of pocket, had to scrub every inch multiple times it was so filthy. We have 3 air purifiers running constantly and 4 essential oil diffusers. When we began working on the house the smell triggered my asthma so badly I had to wear a N95 mask, even 15 min in the home had me unable to breathe. After the old carpets were removed the house reaked of mold, and it's been inspected by trusted individuals who verified there is no present mold, just smells remained from the mold on old carpet. \n\nNow after cleaning so extensively, with air purifiers running I can breathe mask-free, but have to use my rescue inhaler daily (which I haven't needed in a long time) as my asthma is triggered still, even with the piss room closed off. I know it's not healthy to use this sort of inhaler daily and I refuse to keep living like this forever, I shouldn't need an inhaler daily.. I think there's toxic air coming from the room that still smells like pee. \n\nWe are at our wits end trying to figure out how to get this room smelling neutral. My dad has fixed up several homes damaged from cat pee and has never heard of a room STILL smelling like pee after kilz, new carpet and paint.. \n\nThe landlady has become completely useless in terms of helping us. She was diagnosed with cancer the week we signed the lease, and every attempt to advocate for our needs has ended with us being gaslit as if we are high maintenance, and with her saying they can't afford helping us any more due to their chemo bills. Shes lost all her hair since we met in Nov, and weve witnessed how difficult her life has become. While we felt a lot of compassion for her initially (part of what made us rush into this lease was sympathy for their situation and trust in the kindness she showed us she cared enough to help us live in a healthy home), she has gotten so nasty with us that it's becoming obvious her cancer has become an excuse, in every interaction, to manipulate us.. she initially gave us a $100 discount for cleaning ourselves (we had NO idea how filthy it was initially as the windows/doors open during showing, and furnace was off), and she agreed to reimburse us for paint. We sent her receipts so she could deduct from our rent, and I asked at that time if it was possible to reimburse us for any cleaning supplies, understood if it wasn't possible but it was worth asking as we had no idea how much supplies would add up.. and she punished us for asking, pretty much calling us ungrateful as if we were taking advantage of her, and said she shouldn't have to pay for cleaning supplies or paint only said she would pay for paint to be kind, but made it clear we no longer deserved that kindness by reimbursing paint, BUT made us pay her back the $100 cleaning discount, and made us pay her the 2 months of utilities they paid while we couldnt live there as it was inhabitable (and she originally told us to set up utilities the first week we moved in, as we already were paying rent for a house we couldnt live). We kissed ass and paid fees, apologized for even asking, and literally thanked her for the punishment in order to preserve our relationship in case we need anything down the line... After tacking on $400 of her revenge payments to last months rent, our paint wasn't even reimbursed. \n\nWe feel like we can't communicate with this landlady anymore. Not only did she tell us she has no sense of smell so she can't perceive the smell of the pee (not sure if that's true or not) so she can't apparently sense the room still smells like pee, but we had her observe the subfloors before new carpet was installed, and showed her parts of a floor which had become soft/caved in from wall due to urine damage, floor rot so bad in one area that if a person stepped full weight they would go through the floor.. They elected to simply carpet over it without paying for new subfloor. The place is rent to own so that killed any chance of us buying it, but we agreed we could still live here a few years... They've showed us many ways at this point they really couldn't care less about the home/our health there, and we are just trying our damndest to make the most of the situation and live in a healthy environment.. \n\nWe spent over 500 hours of labor on this place in 27 days (including help from friends, yes i went as far as tracking our times as this has been such a thankless task..) after all the work and money we've given this place, getting this piss room smelling neutral is so important to us so we can live here a few years and save up money. If we can't neutralize the smell, we'll be forced to block off the room completely and move out in a year when our lease is up, which would be a huge hardship for us having little time to save. We drained our savings paying for our old place, and the new place for months before we could move in, finally moved in on December 23, and still haven't moved out of our old apartment completely we've been so busy fixing up this place out of health necessity now that we're living there.. \n\nWe have our cat and dog that have moved in with us, and given the chances of them developing behaviors peeing in house if they smell other animals pee, we've kept them contained in the livingroom and have not let them near the pee room, so there is no chance that our animals contribute to the smell. \n\nIf anyone has any advice on how to get this room to stop smelling like pee, PLEASE HELP. This home has become very important to us and it's gonna be devastating if there's really NOTHING we can do.",

    "title": "Some Unsexy Things I've Learned to Love After Home Ownership",
    "post_text": "Hey there.  This is not going to be nearly as deep as the title suggests, and some of these may not necessarily be applicable to all areas.  I live in a region of north america with very moderate weather, no snow, cool, wet winters, warm-to-hot summers, low humidity.  People who live in areas with different climates may find that what I'm saying here doesn't apply.\n\nThese are my preferences for certain home materials and best-practices based on experiences both bad and good.  I've learned not to trust the open-the-door-and-gasp-in-delight impression.  The only things I care about anymore are durability, maintainability, and total cost of ownership, with \"not looking like a badger's asshole\" coming in as a distant fourth-place.  \n\nAnyhow, on with the show:\n\n* Tile.  If it's laid and finished correctly (which you can learn to do yourself with minimal effort (the learning part, the actual laying is a cast-iron bastard)), then it's utterly impervious to almost any common household substance that is likely to fall on it, it's resistant to physical abuse in a way that other floorings can't match, and if a tile is damaged, break it out, replace it, and regrout.  Good luck doing that with your glued-down engineered floor or floating, snap-together laminate.\n\n* Stucco.  My partner and I just spent six thousand dollars replacing fifteen year-old wooden siding that had succumbed to dry rot, whereas my father just recently failed to notice the thirtieth anniversary of him ignoring his stucco because there's not a damn thing wrong with it.  Obviously it can be applied poorly, but again, if it's done right, it's almost maintenance-free.\n\n* Composition roofing.  Again, my partner and I ended up dealing with a nightmare with our tile roof.  It's a story too long, complicated, and frankly traumatic to relate here, but there was nothing wrong with the tile installation, the previous owner just didn't do the periodic maintenance that tile needs.  Because apparently tile needs periodic maintenance.  Wood shakes are a little better.  They just bleach and look like crap after a few years.  A number of our neighbors have composition roofing (see how deftly I sidestepped the ever-thorny issue of how the hell you pluralize the word \"roof?\") that has been on their houses for going on four decades and not one of them have ever had problems.\n\n* For washers and dryers.  If at all possible, I recommend against getting the manufacturer pedestals for them, and instead suggest that you build your own reinforced, leveled platform.  The pedestals make leveling the units a nightmare, because they introduce another degree of freedom that must be accounted for and played with in order to level the machines.  It may seem like a lot of work to build a pedestal, and it is, but it's better than wondering if today is finally the day when your washer walks right out of the laundry room.\n\nObviously, this is all just my opinion, and I'm sure people can post their nightmare stories about each and every one of these things, and I'm sure their gripes are legitimate, but I'd bet that a lot of these problems are because of either poor materials, poor installation, or an installation that was done over an existing problem that someone just hoped would go away.  When it comes to ignoring problems in the hope that they'll just go away, I'm a professional, and I assure you, it never works.  :P",

    "post_text": "\nSo last week I threw a party for my little brothers graduation in my \u2018new\u2019 house that I bought 3 months ago. \nIt\u2019s an older house, built in \u201864, sat vacant for nearly 2 decades- the garage door motor was the original, technically functioning but very much struggling, Montgomery ward, with a big ol\u2019 wooden door in pretty decent shape. \n\nI had purchased a new motor, but I gotta finish the bathroom before I start working on the garage, so the new motor was just waiting to be installed, and I was keeping the garage closed, not using it, until I was able to take the time. \n\nWell to free up driveway space I opened the garage while people would be there so that I could park inside. Everything seemed fine, party went well, around 6pm it peters out everyone leaves and I remove my car from the garage: here\u2019s where things get fun. \n\nI hit the button to close the garage door and I hear the sound of metal grinding. \nNot good\nI try to hit the button again bring it up, but it won\u2019t stop.\nA roller falls off from the very top, and the whole door gets stuck at an angle halfway closed on the left side, about 1/3 closed on the right.\n\nI of course alternate between crying panicking and uselessly trying to straighten it myself. I call my parents who have rental properties in the area and they recommend a good garage door contractor (top rated local contractor, number one google result 4 stars). My mom says since she just worked with him last week she\u2019ll setup an appointment for the next day.\n\nSo the guy shows up, it was just me there; my mom was gonna stop by and help but got busy, so it was just me and the contractor. \nHe starts off \u201cI\u2019m not going to go too in-depth because I\u2019m gonna have to repeat this all to your mom but basically you need a whole new door and all new everything to go with it. \nHe lists off how \u201coh yep those tracks are bent, and it rains so much here that nobody has wood doors, and oh wow those springs are so old and...\u201d \nhis point being that if I didn\u2019t replace everything, not only was I a prize idiot, but also  that my garage would probably collapse in on itself (a slight exaggeration) \nHe flew through the why and ended up showing me his three different options of door and which one I need. \nOh also since the door was stuck halfway shut, he asked if I had any vise grips, because he only had one on him and needed two to fix it. I didn\u2019t, and his response was \u201cok then I\u2019ll need your help to straighten this out. Well let loose the slack and then you and I will just carry it down. (Which didn\u2019t seem right)\n\n\nI told him I needed a minute and stepped inside to call my mom. I told her everything he said it needed and \nShe was like wtf no wait until I get there I\u2019m ~15 Away. \n\nShe gets there and he goes back through everything he said, except with detail this time, still kind of grossing over why it failed other than that \u201cthe whole system is so old\u201d\nHe quotes us at about $2k for a reset, and new everything (including install for the motor I already bought)\n\n\u201cThanks we\u2019ll call you if we want that\u201d\n\nWe ended up calling the contractor who installed the door (or who the last owner used for maintenance, they had their phone number on the fuse box) I described the issue and they said it sounded like I needed new springs, as well as the actual system reset, and the motor. But also there might be more damage they\u2019d have to see to say for sure. Tentatively they said probably about 500, 650 if they install my motor for me. \nI scheduled an apt a day out, but still called the next google result for garage door contractors in my area.\n\nThe owner answers, \u201coh yeah I\u2019m up the street at outback getting lunch, lemme run right over after this\u201d \n\n\u201cPerfect\u201d\n\nHe comes by,\nLooked the system over, marveled at the age of my motor, and I told him about all the previous quoted I\u2019ve received. \n\n\u201cThey told you that you need a new door here?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat company was that??\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGah... scam artists... you definitely need the new motor there, but you\u2019ve got that. The springs have been replaced recently, I can tell by the fact that they are like 5 shades brighter than all the other parts around them. All you need is to get this system actually straightened out, two longer rollers on the top (the roller that failed, $6 each) and the new motor installed.\u201d\n\nHe had his guy come out, fix my door, install the new motor, give me a full tutorial on how to work, upkeep, and maintain the system. \nTotal bill: $293.22\n\nAnd the kicker?? While resetting it, he figured out how my door fell off the track in the first place: someone had slid the manual latch on the door itself into the \u2018locked\u2019 position, and it caught on the track. \n\n\n\nMoral of the story: get a second quote every time, and if you get a weird feeling, get a third quote. \n\nOh and leave the good ones reviews!",

    "post_text": "My husband and I bought our first home a bit over a year ago in Southern California - because of the Covid buying frenzy we went with the previous homeowners termite report, and our inspector didn\u2019t seem to notice anything. Fast forward a few months and I\u2019m wondering what the granules are constantly around my stove. Turns out we had an active colony. We spot treated but after a month I\u2019m still noticing kick out droppings. The termite company came back, took out the above-stove microwave and it appears like the entire wood cabinetry has been thoroughly eaten through. You couldn\u2019t tell from looking at it. The amount of termite kick out on top of the microwave was insane. It was  spot treated again and we also treated for subterranean termites, as I found some very chewed up floorboards that were hidden under heavy furniture during the home inspection. Back to the kitchen termites; Another 3 months go by and I find some dead swarmers. So, we had to tent fumigate our house. My questions: I know fumigation is not preventative. 1. Do they come back because they know there was a colony at one point? 2. How do we keep them away?  3. How bad you reckon the damage might be? 4. do you advise possibly doing a kitchen reno (not that we really have to budget to, I\u2019m mainly curious about structural integrity of the cabinets and hanging microwave)? \nTy for you advice!",

    "post_text": "https://imgur.com/gallery/GcGXItq\n\nI wanted to share our addition and kitchen remodel. We bought a 1956 cape cod in March 2018 and have totally remodeled it. Our largest project was our kitchen. We added on a sunroom to the back of our house and completely gutted and remodeled our 1990\u2019s kitchen. Spring plans include a finished covered patio off the back. You can see it is not finished in the pictures. Exterior remodel-re sided the entire house from tan siding to gray siding and dark gray shakes.\n\nTotal budget-$25,000. Actually spent roughly $30,000. Everything was done by us (my husband mostly with me as the helper) except for the pouring of the footer and the granite install.  My brother in law dug out the hole for the foundation since he knows how to run large machines. It took us 4 months, mostly with weekends as our work days. We moved the sink from the corner of the kitchen to under the window and we also moved our dishwasher over as a result and replaced it to a new stainless steel version. \n\nCabinets are from cabinets.com and cost us roughly $8500. Ended up missing 2 finished end panels and had to order them at the end (our fault). Had a fantastic experience with cabinets.com. Ended up with one damaged door on the upper cabinet in the pantry and they are sending me a free replacement. \n\nFloors are from Lowe\u2019s-stainmaster vinyl planks in washed oak dove. \n\nGranite from and installed by Troy Granite in Pittsburgh\n\nMessiest and worst days-ripping out the plaster ceiling and tearing out the ceramic tile! We put plastic over the doorways to the kitchen and still ended up with black dust all over the house. The tearing out of the floor took us 8 hours and resulted in another entire house cleanup from dust. \n\nIf we knew the ceiling had a drywall ceiling over a higher plaster ceiling we would have gotten 42\u201d cabinets but instead got 36\u201d, but I\u2019m happy with how it looks now!!",

Peeled back the cable sheathing enough and saw it was actually white about 9\u201d down the line. \n\nInsane fire risk.

    "post_text": "I'm trying to solder some new pipes to add onto the plumbing for our laundry room to add in a sink.  I am terrible at it and after wasting too many good pieces, I'm just practicing on a chain of short copper pipes and slip fittings until I can do it reliably.  My goal is to make a long tube with horrible joints on one end and great joints on the other, and mount it on my wall like a samurai sword.\n\nMy tools: propane torch, water soluble flux, acid brush, lead-free solder, wire cleaning tool [like this](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Kobalt-NA-in-Fittings-brush/1002629310?cm_mmc=shp-_-c-_-prd-_-plb-_-google-_-lia-_-208-_-plumbingtools-_-1002629310-_-0&amp;placeholder=null&amp;ds_rl=1286981&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwyvaJBhBpEiwA8d38vDPSkLrzvDNpHiSoa4DWFzyU9mw7IOamj2Pmr6C-nLCt9NOaBS8fuBoCHf8QAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds), worktable, vice grips, fire extinguisher.\n\nI understand that it's a hard thing to teach and that I just have to do what I'm doing and keep practicing, but I think I need some rules of thumb.\n\nThe main problem I'm having is that the flux burns off before the copper is hot enough to melt the solder.\n\nI am really perplexed about how hot this is supposed to be and how long it's supposed to take.  First thing I was taught was to do it low and slow, turning the gas up until the torch ignites and then turning it down, then slowly passing the piece over the flame, tapping the solder to it periodically until it melts, and then applying it.  This was a confusing technique to me, just because mapp torches exist.  It seemed to work but probably took upwards of 60 seconds and I quickly realized there was no flux left by the time I soldered the joint.\n\nNext thing I tried, after being told this should only take 5-10 seconds, was turning the flame up quite high, pass the fitting through the bright part of the flame in brief passes until it's hot enough, and then apply solder while the heat's on and then for a few seconds after.  Every time I've tried that it's been the same problem, the flux is all gone and the solder still hasn't even started to spot.\n\nI keep hearing that I'm not adding enough flux but I have the same problem even when slathering it on pretty thick, and every video I watch it doesn't look like they're putting on much flux at all.  I assume that temperature and heating is the main problem, but I can't tell what direction I'm supposed to go in or what it's supposed to be like.  HALP PLZ",

    "post_text": "Hello, a new homeowner here, and we have a newly built home and moved in July and live in Minnesota.\n\nI noticed the caulking started cracking and going bad around 2 months of living in the home, but it may have started sooner. I have attached some of the caulking work they did below. \n\nThe construction company provides a free 3-month, 4-hour touch-up, and they cover painting, wall dings less than an inch, and some caulking, but in our case, they said that the caulking damage is our fault due to the humidity in the house being too dry. As everyone can assume, Minnesota has pretty dry air in the winter and gets pretty cold.  They will not pay the contractors to cover caulking. \n\nI have a humidity gauge and a smart nest thermostat that tells me the humidity, and because we have a baby, we have been monitoring the humidity to stay above 30%, most of the time averaging around 38%-42%. \n\nWe have a built-in humidifier with the house that runs every time heat is going or the air exchanger is running. I also have a cool-mist humidifier for our nursery. I have notes that the construction manager told us to keep the house between 30-40%, especially in the winter to keep the building materials in shape. \n\n**TL;DR:** 2-months into living in a newly built home, grout is cracking and disappearing, it's been 4-5 months now. The construction company won't cover it because they said our house is too dry and need to keep the humidity up. I live in Minnesota where the winters can be pretty harsh but the house has been above 30% humidity. \n\n**Question:** Is the construction company trying to get around paying and doing repairs? Did the contractor just do a poor job and use horrible quality caulking? Or am I just making this up and it's something that happens when the humidity gets as low as 30% in the winter? Should I just bite it and do the repairs myself? Fairly affordable, but my experience with caulking is limited\n\n**Photos:**\n\n[https://imgur.com/HyWPG2j](https://imgur.com/HyWPG2j)\n\n[https://imgur.com/aymkEtV](https://imgur.com/aymkEtV)\n\n[https://imgur.com/lakceTe](https://imgur.com/lakceTe)\n\n[https://imgur.com/tvPRf45](https://imgur.com/tvPRf45)",

    "title": "Office Shed Build",
    "post_text": "I've seen a number of posts asking about building a shed/office so I thought I'd post about my experience. I actually had started to think about doing this last year and when COVID happened and my company said we'd be WFH till at least the end of year, I decided to go for it. My home improvement/building skills were fairly rudimentary before all of this and I wanted to use this as an opportunity to learn new things. And boy did I learn!! The big caveat in all of this is that I decided to use a pre-fabricated Tuff Shed instead of building from scratch. I did a bunch of research on building the structure myself but since this was going to be mainly a weekend project, it would have just taken too long to do myself. I also farmed out the electrical run from the main house to the shed location. I brought a 60amp 220v line and quite frankly, I don't mess with that much electricity. I did dig the trench myself which actually did save quite a bit of money.\n\nLink to pics with comments in the description: https://imgur.com/gallery/zO3gALo\n\nBelow are the details and cost for the major items. I'm not including little things like junction boxes, outlets, network cable, etc. I live in the SF Bay Area so pretty much everything tends to be more expensive than most other places.\n\n**Foundation:** The location where I wanted the shed to be was about 8 inches off level on existing grass/dirt. The Tuff Shed folks said they'll level up to 4 inches for free and then change for additional leveling. Their idea of leveling is basically just using concrete pavers. My neighbor across the street does foundations for a living so he helped me figure out what to do here. We decided to run 2 4x8 pressure treated beams that the shed joists would sit on perpendicularly. The beams would sit on 6 concrete piers (3 under each beam) 18 inches deep. I did the majority of the labor and it cost **$350** for the a mixing truck to come and give us enough cement for the 6 piers. Having the cement pre-mixed and delivered saved a ton of time/effort in mixing ourselves. Well worth the cost. We ended up needing to also buy 6 2x6 pressure treated beams for the joists (see the next section for details).\n\n**Shed Structure:** I purchased the Tuff Shed from Home Depot. You're somewhat limited on the sizes and styles but you save 20-30% vs buying directly from Tuff Shed. I went with 10x12 TR-800 w/ 8ft walls. After adding 3 windows plus a windowed door, the cost came to **$4700**. This includes the structure, outside paint and trim, and studs 16\" OC with a plywood floor. It also included all installation. We ran into a problem on the day of the install. It turns out the \"galvanized steel\" 2x6 joists they provide are no different than the cheap, hollow studs they use in commercial construction on non-load bearing walls. I convinced the installers to give me a couple of hours and I raced to buy 6 2x6 pressure treated beams + hangers and attached those to the 4x8 beams to replace the crappy joists they were going to put in. The installers just put down the plywood flooring directly on that. Note: this wouldn't have been issue if they were installing directly to the ground or concrete pad. In hindsight, I probably would have just paid a little more and done a concrete pad (neighbor said that would have been around $1000 w/ labor). This would have saved me a lot of backbreaking digging and extra cost for the wood beams.\n\n**Electrical/Data:** As stated above, I paid a local electrician to run the electricity for me to the structure. This involved installing 2 60amp breakers in the main house panel, running about 40 feet in the attic, dropping it down to the ground, and then underground to the site, about 20 feet. They then installed a sub-panel to the outside of the shed with two 20 amp circuits for outlets, one 15 amp circuit for lights, and a 220v 30 amp circuit for HVAC. I did all of the wiring in the shed for the outlets and lights. I also gave them a box of CAT6 cable which they ran for me in a separate conduit. The total for this was **$2700** including all labor and materials.\n\n**Insulation:** I did this myself in a day...about **$100** in material.\n\n**Drywall:** I had every intention of doing the drywall myself however my wife had an unexpected trip to the hospital and had an emergency appendectomy. So I was out of commission taking care of the kids for 2 weeks so I ended up paying a guy **$1500** to hang, mud, and texturize. Honestly, I'm glad I did...I really think I would have messed it up.\n\n**HVAC:** As I stated, I live in the SF Bay Area so our climate isn't that extreme. That being said, it does get pretty warm out here in the summer and it can occasionally get below freezing at night in the winter. Thanks to the good folks on this sub, they introduced me to a mini split HVAC. It's quiet and efficient. The problem I ran into was the install. A company called Mr. Cool does sell a DIY but they were out of stock for a while. I found another one that does come pre-charged but required a vacuum pump to clear it out before charging. I didn't really want to mess with this so I tried to find someone to install for me. Nobody would touch it! Every HVAC person I called said they would only install their own equipment and that was gonna start at $4k. The one I bought from Home Depot was **$1000**. My neighbor finally found an HVAC friend that would do it on the side for **$600**.\n\n**Flooring:** I just used vinyl flooring that had pre-attached underlayment from Home Depot. It's only 120 sq/ft so it wasn't that much. It was about **$450** for flooring, baseboards, and trim.\n\n**Lighting**: Because the roof rafters are only 2x4's, a standard canned lighting fixture won't fit in there. I found six 6in LED \"pancake\" lights that worked perfectly. **$60** on Amazon.\n\n**Everything Else**: I probably spent another **$700** on a bunch of little things like tools, outlets, data cable, smart switches, etc.\n\nSo the total cost I spent is around **$11,000** and that's with doing a lot of work myself. This biggest costs were the shed structure itself and the electrician. If you're comfortable doing those yourself, you could probably cut this close to in half. I'm pretty happy with how everything has turned out. I learned a ton and felt I did what I could I mostly farmed out the work that I just wasn't comfortable doing myself. Oh, I spent literally hours and hours watching YouTube videos on everything from wiring to installing vinyl flooring.\n\nEdit: fixed dimensions of the joists",

Starting with: don\u2019t try to take on a tiling project while home alone with your toddler. At many points I was confined to working in tiny sections because she\u2019d literally be hanging on my leg so I couldn\u2019t move freely about the space. She also didn\u2019t like the sound of the saw so I tried to be efficient by marking cuts I needed while she was awake, and making the cuts in bulk while she was asleep. This worked out for the most part, except in one area where I got impatient and tried to continue the pattern without the cut pieces \ud83d\ude11 lessons were learned. So yeah, there\u2019s definitely one bit where the tiles are not perfectly flush with each other, that\u2019s on me. Oh well, I\u2019ll only notice it every day for the next 10 years or so\u2026nbd.\n\nOh well, just glad it\u2019s done now haha.\n\nI still plan to swap out the LED light strips. These are the ones the builder installed and they are way too yellow for my liking (they are more yellow IRL). And I also need to find new wall hooks for the hand towels. The brass ones were leftover from another project and they looked better in my head\u2014oops.\n\n*edit: reformatted for cut off text*",

This would only cover the one long window and would be braced against the other window, but it would be more light blockage than nothing at all.\n* I've considered a cornered curtain rod, but the corner would have to hover without being able to mount into the ceiling, and 12 feet of rod + a few more feet around the corner is a lot of length to support without bracing.\n\nAny suggestions?

    "post_text": "I will try and keep this short, but I am in a panic.\n\nI had carpet in a basement that was starting to stink so we decided to take it up and go with a polished concrete look.  Hired a guy to come do the job that was recommended by a friend for the same work.  He showed up Monday of last week, pulled out the carpet and was perplexed by the black adhesive that was under the carpet.  He assumed it was \"some sort of waterproofing thing\" and tried to get it up with some solvent (smelled like mineral spirits).  That didn't seem to work so he proceeded to grind/sand it off to get the bare concrete.  I went down there once to check on progress and it was very dusty (he was on his knees and the grinder/sander was hooked up to a shop vac) but it was a haze.  He was wearing a mask, I was not.  The basement door was closed to the main level with a towel underneath it the entire time it was being worked on.  The basement door to the garage was open and there was furniture and other things pulled out of the basement sitting in the garage during the work.  Since then there has been limited foot traffic to and from the basement but I am sure some dust has worked it's way into the main living floor via shoes, etc.\n\nFast forward to yesterday as I am googling \"water proofing thing\" and discover black mastic.  My house was built in 1970, so I can only assume the stuff he was grinding was black mastic and the cloud of dust contained asbestos.  I have also read that grinding/sanding is the absolute worst thing you can do as it allows the previously encapsulated asbestos to be free and airborne.\n\nI have a few questions:\n\n1. How concerned do I need to be about my limited exposure to the dust cloud?\n2. If the door was closed and the return air vent in the basement was covered in plastic, should I be concerned about asbestos being on the upper levels of the house?  This would mainly be from tracking the dust in after the fact.\n3. What do I need to do to all of the stuff in my garage which is attached to the basement and has a somewhat thick layer of dust on it?\n\nI have read both extremes due to my inability to sleep caused by the anxiety.  Some people say wear some PPE, clean it up with a HEPA vacuum and wet-wipe all hard surfaces and go on about your life.  Others are saying I need to basically throw away all of my possessions and pay a remediation company $50k to deep clean my home.\n\nI have ordered a test kit and it should be here tomorrow.  Based on what I am reading, I am assuming it will come back positive so that is how I am operating.\n\nAny advice, suggestions?",

    "title": "First Bath Remodel",
    "post_text": "**UPDATE:** I had to redo post as I did not give enough details on the process/materials used. This may prove to be more difficult than the actual remodel.\n\nMy wife told me that she wanted a new bathroom for 1000.00USD or less. I advised her that I could probably get her everything she needs/wants but it wouldn't be the premium materials. Since we will be making this our third rental property, she approved the lower grade material idea.\n\nYou will find an outline of how the work was done, challenges I faced and an idea of the materials used below:\n\n**Design**\\- This was done in my head. I knew I wanted tile floors instead of rolled vinyl and that I wanted tile on the wall with accent tiles and I wanted the bath surround to go to the ceiling. Color was a no-brainer. The trend these days is gray and white.\n\n**Demo**\\- Had a buddy come over and started with the walls. Initial plan was to just remove old tile on  bath surround and place new tiles. Here is where I learned that this was not going to happen and I would need to gut the room. This is the easy part... take everything outside and through it in the struck (did you know that a 50 square foot bathroom will fit in the back of an f150?).\n\n**Planning**\\- After the dust had settled I calculated my square footage. This had to be done on the floor as well as on the walls. I got all of my materials from Lowe's since I get a 10% discount.\n\n**Materials:**Bag of grout mixTwo five gallon buckets20 boxes of 12inx12in ceramic tile (.73/square ft)Two tubes of MAPAI Color match sanded caulking60x16x30 tub20x 12inx12in mosaic mesh tile (cut in half for accent ribbonPVC trim for crown and transition from wall to surroundVanity (came with basin, sink and mirrior1 Gallon of SharkTooth Gray paint1 quart of pure white paintKholer high round toilet with canister flush and slow close seat6 1/2inx36inx60in Hardy Backer board2 1/4inx36inx60in2 1/2inx48inx96in sheet rockKholer sink faucetDelta Shower faucet/handle/headGeneric shower head with detachable sprayerSmall tub premix drywall mudPaper drywall tapeOrange seam tape for backer board1 Tube construction adhesive\n\n**Tools:**DrillBackerboard screwsHammersChannel Locks3/32 Alan wrenchSpongesSquare notch trowelFloat trowel1/8in Tile Spacers6in Level3ft LevelAir CompressorBrad nailerWrench setToilet flange spacerHVAC Vent coverAngle grinderWet sawRazor Blades\n\n**Issues:**\n\nThe subfloor was not in terrible condition, so I left it there and decided I would put backer board over it. This increased the thickness of the floor which would call for a riser for the toilet flange.\n\nWhere we pulled the vanity, we learned that the plumbing was coming in from the entry wall (left side) instead of directly behind for faucet hook up. It would cost too much to re-route so I decided I would shorten the pipe coming in from the wall to the p trap and cut a hole in the left side of the vanity for the plumbing to fit.\n\nThe walls were not square nor plumb. This made our 60in tub too short. Since we had to make sure the shower wall was perfect, I added and extra 1/4in piece of backer board to the back-end of the tub to make it come flush with the wall outside the tub while ensuring it was inline with the tub. This took a lot of trial and error.\n\nWhen doing the tile on the wall, my grout was drying exceptionally fast even though the mix was exactly what it was the day before. This is where moth nature messed with progress. I though I had more time to wipe excess than I did. This is where razor blades and a lot of patience comes in handy. After many hours it was all cleaned up and ready to go.\n\nThe PVC molding I got was just a little too short for the entire job. At the entrance I had to splice to pieces together by cutting perpendicular miter cuts and sliding them together.\n\n[RESULTS](https://imgur.com/gallery/78Wd6v2)\n\n2nd edit: Overall I went over budget by 200.00USD totalling 1200.USD. This included the purchase of the trowels, sponges and spacers for the tile.",

    "post_text": "So my wife has been dissatisfied with the layout of our living room and thought the ideal thing to add to the space was a light fixture.  Problem - there was no rough in ready to go and the ceiling of our townhome is concrete.\n\nShe struck on the idea of buying a plug in light and the running the cable under a cover along the ceiling to the wall, then down a corner of the wall to an outlet.  Now the issue is how do we get the darned thing up there - considering we don't own a rotary hammer and she likely wouldn't trust me to go drilling into the ceiling myself.\n\nReading online she heard of using construction adhesive to stick 1-2 hooks onto the ceiling, and then hook onto the chain of the light.  I'm somewhat concerned as the fixture is about 12 pounds, and I just have fears running through my head of the thing crashing down.\n\nHas anyone tried this before? Should we abandon this madcap scheme and hire someone to drill into the ceiling and hang the light?",

I've used adhesives in the past, but they don't seem to hold over over time imo.\n\nI'm looking for something similar to this, but, for an outdoor 8\" thick fence. Any ideas? \n\nAdditional Note: I'm trying to hang the heavy duty type outdoor lights, and the cord is fairly heavy, so I think I need something that can support at least a few pounds.  \n\nWhat I have in my mind is similar to this, http://www.homedepot.com/p/Richelieu-Hardware-4-5-in-Over-Door-Pewter-Single-Hook-99854BAG/202213856\nbut at least 8 inches wide, and to make things more complicated, the top of the wall is rounded. \n\nThanks for any suggestions\n\nEdt: I just thought I'd give an update for anyone who is looking for the same thing.

They are old VCT (?) tiles with cutback adhesive under them. House was built in 1965 so both the tiles and adhesive probably have asbestos in them. The tiles are easily popping up with a flat shovel/scraper due to the moisture breaking down the adhesive. From what I've read the best option will be to remove all tiles and cover the adhesive with a skimcoat concrete such as Ardex feather finish. Here is a general idea of what the floor looks like, this is one of the worst spots: http://imgur.com/a/O9HO5\n\n\nAnother question. One of the rooms has wood paneling, is it likely that there is mold/mildew on the back of this and should it be removed? I would imagine it wouldn't soak up moisture like drywall. ",

Right now I'm just duct taping it, but it falls down every 2 hours or so.\n\nThank you!\n\nEdit: I take it back, it's probably about 5 pounds.",

I naively thought \"hey, maybe there's a standard hookup beneath the black plastic part that seems impossible to remove\". As it turns out, there's nothing there but a useless black plastic hole with no sort of threading whatsoever. The only hookups I can see maybe being possible to hook this thing up to are our actual water line (which is something I'd really rather avoid), or [the hookup that we screw the pull-out faucet into](https://imgur.com/iLBKayY). If anyone has a simple solution or set of adapters I can get to make this thing work, my apartment and our dirty dishes would be extremely relieved.\nI should also note: this is one of the dishwashers that you normally clip into the sink itself, e.g. no actual hookups for water lines",

There is no transformer involved, and the power supply it's fine, the wires themselves seem to be \"disconnected\"!**\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/KzKwixR\n\nI have a 100+ year old house, and although there was no doorbell hooked up when I came, I was able to find two very old looking wires sticking out from some insulation in my basement that through the magic of a wire tracer / toner I was able to confirm went to the doorbell.\n\nAnyway I hooked up the wires in the basement with a Ring power adapter directly, and my Ring doorbell has happily been working the past 5 months.\n\nThe other day my Ring \"randomly\" stopped working - I hadn't bumped anything, etc, it just stopped working. I figured the doorbell itself was bad (also I live in Michigan and it's very cold so I didn't bother to go out and detach it from the house to check for power) so I ordered a new one... when I went out though, BAM, no power.\n\nI _think_ one of the wires is somehow \"disconnected\", or broken, somehow (? seems very weird to me that it would just randomly stop working?), because as you can see in the photos above (sorry they're so bad) I connected two ends and tried to use a multi-meter to check for continuity and nothing. Strangely though (or maybe not, I don't really know how these things work) when I hook the tone generator up TO EITHER WIRE I still hear the tone on the other end.\n\nAnyway my questions are basically\n\n1. Any thoughts as to how this would have happened?\n2. Given my testing methodology with the alligator clip connecting two ends and using a multimeter to test for continuity should I be pretty confident that one of the wires is somehow \"disconnected\" or \"broken\"?\n3. In one of the photos you can see the insulation, it's not a big patch of it but it's stapled in or something, I'm not sure how / if it's OK to remove it and if so how / if I can replace it?\n4. I'm thinking if I buy some new wire (18 gauge?) I might be able to use the old wires to pull the new wire through (assuming I remove the insulation that is over the wires so I have access) - does that seem likely to work? Is there something else I should try first?\n\nThanks for your help, sorry for such a long post!\n\n\nEdit: some additional facts:\n\n1. the wire is different on one end than the other - the end where the actual doorbell goes is newer, the end in the basement feesl like a very old wire\n2. I _think_ it's a fairly straight shot vertically / upwards to the doorbell - I'm pretty sure the door is right below where the wires are exposed in the basement.",

    "title": "Home Insulation Project COMPLETED",
    "post_text": "I have seen this posted a couple times, but my husband and I finally completed our biggest project yet, reinsulating our house. We had been waiting to do this for a while as our 1983 built house was just not insulated enough.  The house would fluctuate wildly. We received a home energy audit the first year we lived in the house and we were told that new windows/doors and air sealing the attic and blowing in more insulation would make a huge difference for us. We were very leaky, and the estimated R value in the attic was R-16. So that is what we have set out to work on this year.\n\nFirst off, going into this project we knew that we needed to finish some on the ground stuff first. So in leading up to this, we had about 30 new cans lights put in, replaced our ceiling fans and put in bracers, did some updates to our HVAC system, vented our microwave vent hood to the roof, got our bathroom vent fans properly hooked up and got the three attic fans up and properly running. This is all stuff we largely did with the old insulation being there. We wanted all of this done so we didn't have to disturb our new insulation later. \n\nNext up, building the insulation removal machine. We thought we were going to rent a professional machine and we thought about hiring it out. However, we found some youtube videos on people building one with a 2 HP dust collector, which Harbor Freight sells for $209.99 and 3\" corrugated solid drain pipe, so that's what we did. It took us a few weeks to get the machine in and an evening to put it all together.  Amazon sells insulation removal bags made by a brand named Rhino, so we bought 15 of those.\n\nNow for insulation sucking time! This really was the worst part of the project for us. It took us 8 days of work spread over 3 weeks pulling the insulation out. There was bird nests, and mice droppings and other critter crap. Some of the spaces were really tight to get into. It was dusty, hot and gross. And the worst part was that our roof at some point formerly had been a cedar shake roof, and there was a ton of debris that kept clogging our line. Lots of frustration, but we filled every single bag we bought and dumped roughly 1200 pounds of old insulation.\n\nNext was fixing all electrical issues that were now exposed in our empty attic. This took the husband a few days of crawling around. Luckily it wasn't too much because he had been updating this stuff over the last couple years. \n\nInstalling baffles and airsealing was the last steps before blowing. We installed plastic ventilation baffles for all of the soffits which were now outfitted with metal soffit cover to keep critters out. This was rough due to needing to get deep into the side. A hammer tacker made it much easier. We tried the foam ones but they were too flimsy in the tight space and nails from the roof wanted to break them. We used a great stuff pro series gaps and crack foam with the foam gun to air seal all of the top plates, around our HVAC return (which we found had been installed very crappily by our HVAC guys and was pulling a ton of air from the attic). We put in Tenmat recessed can insulation covers over every recessed can and foam sealed. This was another 3 days or so of work.\n\nFINALLY FOR THE NEW STUFF! We bought 50 bags of insulation, this was enough to bring the 2100 feet we were insulating up to an R49 according to Owens Corning attic cat site. Machine rental was free from home depot. They screwed up on our delivery 3 weeks in a row so we were able to get a 2nd day of rental for free, which is what we needed. This whole project is really a 2 man gig, but here most of all. My husband was in the garage and I was on loading.  1/3 of the bale of insulation went in about every 2 minutes. We got to a point were we were blowing in a bag every 8 minutes.  Dealing with some hot days, this also turned into a 2 day ordeal.\n\nBREAKDOWN ON COSTS\n\n* $200 Insulation bags\n* $210 Insulation machine\n* $150 Piping\n* $50 baffles\n* $250 Spray foam and gun\n* $450 Tenmat recessed light cover\n* $1400 Insulation\n* $100 random stuff (tyvek suits, gloves, walkie talkies - which were clutch when dealing with issues)\n\nTOTAL: $2810\n\nThere is probably some costs I am missing, and this is really rough, but this is most of the big stuff.  \n\nIn referencing how this would have cost had we had a pro do it. Our neighbor just had the insulation removed from her house due to a house fire while we were doing ours. They paid $3100 for removal only. His professional machine clogging is how I now know that both our houses used to be cedar shake roofs. We had received a quote a while back to just insulate, and it was $2400ish. So despite the hard work, we definitely saved money doing it ourselves.\n\nDid it work? We have noticed a huge difference already.  For the first time ever, every temp sensor in our house is reading the same temperature. We had a 90 degree day yesterday and I was able to get the house down to 68! Which is not a temp we keep it at, but it was nice. \n\n Will we do it again? Looking back on it, I would have paid the pro to suck it all out. We will never ever ever do that again. I'm glad we did it once, but we wont do it again. The other stuff wasn't terrible, just hard work and I wish we had started sooner in the year so capture some better temperature days. \n\nImgur: Didn't get many pictures of the project unfortunately.

    "post_text": "[https://imgur.com/a/wXNaI2g](https://imgur.com/a/wXNaI2g)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHello everyone, hope you are doing well! Moved into our home last year in June and been learning a lot from youtube and this sub. It is a side by side vertical split townhome so I have to coordinate some changes with my neighbor. Was hoping to get some input from y'all. So as soon as we moved in I noticed a curtain of water every time we had a moderate to heavy rain. The curtain doesn't seem to be from the gutters overflowing from the front. I got gutter cleaners out in November cause i was worried about  having clogged gutters going into winter. Gutters were already clean for the most part, there is no overflow in the downspout either. From the youtube videos I've watched my gutters placement don't really make sense to me (i have some comments in the imgur links). Could y'all take a look and give me some guidance? Main questions are: 1. Is it truly installed wrong in the first place. 2. Should I call a gutter install company to quote new gutters and inspect/repair any other damage to that area of the roof? 3. Or are the gutters salvageable and I just need a gutter repair company  to come take a look?\n\nI'm worried if i call a gutter install company they'll quote new gutters no matter the issue. I got basement waterproofing contractors to quote a quick fix and a long term fix of some sump pump issues and their quotes were overkill for the quick fixes. They just wanted to dig no matter what. I ended up doing the research, buying and installing a dual sump pump and battery backup system myself, cleaning the drain tyle under the basement floor with a sewer jetter kit and pressure washer, and this weekend i'll be digging up and inspecting up to the first 90 of the outside drain cause i think it has settled and there is a leak down there. I guess issue I tend to have is finding the right people that can balance cost and investigating/fixing the issue cause I am not willing to do that for our gutters myself with how high the roofline is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the input y'all. So here are the options I am considering based on all the comments and all my research:\n\n1. Improving existing drip edge by pulling it further away from the fascia to try and direct water into the gutter and prevent adhesion\n2. Installing longer drip edge that can run all the way down to the gutter to replace current drip edge \n3. Installing second strip of flashing underneath drip edge to extend it to the gutter\n4. Relocate gutter further upwards on \"first step\" imediately after roofline. This might require new gutters or installing wood backing to support the gutter or \"packing it out\" below since there might not be enough material to have pitch on the gutter on that narrow top step. \n\nCompanies I'll be looking into:\n\n1. Roofing company\n2. Gutter company\n3. Siding company\n\nThanks again! ",

    "post_text": "We are tiling our entire main floor, a project that came about because of a custom kitchen we are getting.  (We have concrete floors with Komiko acid stain on a Mapei self-leveling concrete which looked spectacular back in the day, but not so much anymore. Also, the new kitchen counters will expose an existing hole in our floor that we either try to concrete over and match, or put in a new tile floor over the concrete. We have decided on the latter. We have already started tiling the rest of the main floor, so don't try to talk us out of tiling.) The tiles are black \"Brazilian Slate 2'x2' (slate look, but porcelain).\n\nMy wife and I are GCs on the project and doing the demolition, tiling, electrical and core drilling ourselves. We are hiring a plumber for hooking up sinks and water to fridge. The kitchen design company is installing the new cabinetry.\n\nShould we tile the floor after removing existing cabinets and before the new kitchen is installed, or wait for the new kitchen cabinets and tile around them?\n\nEdit: Thanks for all of the wonderful advice. Based on the consensus, and the fact that my wife thinks we should tile before installing cabinets, that's what we are going to do. :-)   PS: We've already purchased the tile and can't easily return it, so the only extra cost is in thinset, grout and our time.  My wife and I are doing it ourselves. We asked over 15 local tilers for quotes and only received one. $29K for 1200 ft2 open concept main floor. We are about half-way done and it looks very good. (A few rookie mistakes that only we'll notice.)\n\nEdit 2: Moderator Bot tells me I have to get 3 quotes. I tried, contacting all (15+) local tilers, but due to everyone being so busy, we only received 1 quote. We received a list of qualified contractors from the tile supply company and contacted everyone on that list.",

    "post_text": "Hi all,\n\nBackground: this is for my parents' house. I gifted them a new wired doorbell camera that I tried to install. Their doorbell has NOT worked for years and they've been relying on a battery powered button. I shut off the switch at the breaker for the doorbell wires and removed the button. Then I turned on the power to measure voltage and my multimeter reads 0V across the two wires, confirming that the power is off. At the chime, there are 2 sets of bundled wires. Each bundle has different colored wires. Only the blue and white wires are being used. The rest of the wires were unstripped (until I stripped them as I explain later on).\n\nI assume that one of the bundles is coming from the transformer and one is going to the doorbell button. I disconnected the chime. There are 2 exposed blue wires and the white wires of both bundles are connected together. The voltage drop between 1 of the blue wires (B1) and the white wire (W) is measuring around 16V, the same as the drop between the terminals of the transformer. The drop between the other blue wire (B2) and W is 0V, so I'm assuming that this blue wire goes to the doorbell button. I hooked B1 and B2 together but I'm still measuring 0V at the doorbell, so the wire must be broken at some point between the chime and the doorbell. Can anybody here confirm that this makes sense? \n\nI've adopted a diagram from \"Ring\" cameras to show what I think is happening ([https://imgur.com/a/McaIyTV](https://imgur.com/a/McaIyTV)) . I've tried stripping the other colored wires and attaching them to B1, but all of them measured 0V at the button.\n\nMy issue now is having to lay down new wires. I tried to pull the bundle through the doorbell hole, but it seems stuck. My original thought was to tie a string to the bundle at the chime, then I could attach a new wire to the string and pull it through. Is it normal in home construction to secure the wires at specific points? Same thing happened at the hole behind the chime.\n\nI have no experience with home construction or electrician work so please let me know what you guys would do. Please and thank you for any responses.",

Luckily we still had some contractors around to patch the wood floor (they were already patching floor in the kitchen, so cost rolled into that project), run the plumbing and electric (only a single 240V outlet was needed for the laundry units), and put up drywall. Our drywall guy was already working in the hallway moving the attic access over slightly and installing pull-down stairs, and re-painting the hallway doors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile too tiny for full size washer &amp; dryer, we were able to find some well-reviewed BOSCH compact units that didn't require a dryer vent. I was pretty happy to come across the Wirecutter recommendation for them after I'd ordered from Home Depot: [https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-compact-washer-and-dryer/](https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-compact-washer-and-dryer/). The ventless condenser aspect of the dryer takes some getting used to, but once the BOSCH technician came out to set stuff up properly (the Home Depot installers didn't do a great job), it drains much better. We made sure to leave some space between the units and countertop so we could keep a folded up drying rack. Appliances ended up being under $2k.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the cabinets &amp; counter, I used the IKEA planning tool to figure it out. My partner and I installed the wallpaper, cabinets, and countertop ourselves, so saved a bit on labor there. Originally we were going to do a trimmer cover panel so the cabinets didn't have a gap around them, but remembered what a pain that is to do from doing the kitchen, so we left the cabinets floating, and I think they look fine. The countertop was a little tricky to trim, since the wall was a little lumpy, but a hand planer helped get the little extra off we needed. The white caulking on the sides of the countertop made the transition from the wall look really nice. We had to use clear caulking between the counter and wallpaper, which is fine, but not great. We marred up the walls a bit installing the counter, which we'll need to patch and paint.

    "post_text": "I put in a new PEX system for a bathroom I added to our master bedroom.  At every step of the process I pressure tested the system with air at 80psi. Rough in, hardie installed, shower stubouts installed and capped after Tile.  At all of these stages pressure held overnight.  \n\nI just installed the Sink fixtures and the system started losing about 10psi/hr.  You would think the problem would be in the sink but it is not.  If I turn the shower valve to the off position, pressure holds overnight.  As soon as I turn the shower on, pressure starts to drop irreguardless of which fixture is active via the divertor valve.  \n\nBecause of the extremely weird circumstances in which it will/will not hold pressure I believe the leak is happening between the mixing valve and divertor valve.  Soapy water didnt work so I went out and bought the Oatey leak tester fluid.  That identified two leaks which dont seem to be leaking anymore (NPT plug was leaking.  Removed, replaced teflon tape, and reinstalled).  \n\nI still have a leak and I dont see any signs of a leak using the leak testing fluid.  My only access point is on the backside since Tile is now installed in the shower.  This creates its own set of problems since I have blocking installed to mount the mixing valve and divertor valve. \n\n**TL;DR  I have a leak in my PEX System.  I have isolated the issue but cant located the leak.  Without tearing out all of my tile, cutting away all the blocking, or hooking the system up to the supply lines and watching for water....are there any other simple tests I can do to try and locate the leak?**",

The panels are paid for ($20Kish), but after they were installed on the roof, the owners \u201cgot tired\u201d of being asked to make payments and stopped short of actually hooking them up, even though it appears the electrical system was outfitted for the panels \u2014 so the owners never actually reaped the benefits of the panels (yes \u2014 I find it odd too, but they\u2019re odd folks). The electrical outfitting looks suspect at best\u2026 there\u2019s duct tape over the box and such. \n\nThe solar company that installed them is now defunct and the roof needs to be replaced. Due to insurance and timeline, we have to replace the roof at closing (removing the panels). We\u2019ll get a roof inspection, shore up insurance, and then be able to tackle the solar panel piece.\n\nI\u2019m kind of at a loss as to what to do after the solar panels are removed. I love the idea of solar if it can cut down on the energy bills of our 3,000sqft house, but want to make sure I\u2019m not making it more trouble than it\u2019s worth. My questions:\n\nAre 2018 panels worth re-installing? \n\nWould a solar company even be interested in installation since we wouldn\u2019t be buying the panels? \n\nDo the panels have value on the secondary market? \n\nWould a home battery be a better investment than hooking it to the grid?\n\nHoping for some slight direction as to the next step!

    "title": "It\u2019s a good idea to learn a little about everything.",
    "post_text": "*Edited to add a video walkthrough, streamable link at the bottom.*\n\nAn electrical company, very highly reviewed online, upgraded my panel last week. I had run a few new circuits and asked them to test them, make sure my work was up to code before inspection, and then hook them into the panel, which they agreed to.\n\nTwo days ago I installed an exterior light, which was running off one of the new circuits. Today I installed an exterior outlet, run off the same circuit.\n\nI plugged in my electrical outlet tester, which spat back out a \u201chot neutral reversed\u201d warning. This indicates that the black and white wires are mixed up somewhere on the circuit.\n\nI shut the breaker off and removed the outlet. Then checked my wiring, (black to brass, white to silver, green to ground) All good there. \n\nHere\u2019s a diagram of a correctly wired outlet: https://imgur.com/gallery/gUyYGup\n\nSo I got my multimeter out and turned the breaker on. The multimeter showed 123 volts black to white (makes sense) 0 volts black to ground (not good) and 123 volts white to ground (not good). White and black are reversed somewhere in the circuit.\n\nHere\u2019s me testing a different receptacle, also hot neutral reversed, hard to see but the voltage reading is 123 from white to ground: https://imgur.com/gallery/cuB5zB5\n\nSo I went backwards down the circuit. Breaker off, light down, breaker on, multimeter out. Still reading as a hot neutral reversed. Breaker off, switches removed, breaker on, multimeter out. The cable going directly to the panel still reading as hot neutral reversed.\n\nMain off, take the cover off of the panel and here we go. \n\nThe panel has almost all afci or dual function afci/gfci breakers to keep it current with code.\n\nThese afci breakers have the white run directly into them and then run from the breaker to the neutral bar. Except that the electrician had wired an entire half of the panel with the blacks where the whites go and the whites where the blacks go. Major problem.\n\nWhen the hot and neutral are reversed it can create serious problems with receptacles and devices plugged into receptacles. Electricity can be flowing through them even when it shouldn\u2019t be, leading to serious shock and fire hazards.\n\nThe most concerning part is that the receptacles still work. So a receptacle with mixed polarity (hot neutral reverse) can go undetected for years until a shock or a fire.\n\nThe only way to know is if you test the circuit and find it beforehand. As far as I can tell, the electricians who upgraded my panel tested none of the new circuits and definitely didn\u2019t double check their own work. \n\nThe whole point of this is that it\u2019s worth learning a little about everything, even if you\u2019re bringing a professional in. \n\nA year ago I would have had the electricians run the circuits, upgrade the panel, install the outlets and lights and then never thought about it again. Plugging things in willy-nilly, breeze flowing through my hair and not an electrical care in the world. Now I can do those things, but also with correct wiring in my electrical panel.\n\nYou can get an electrical outlet tester for $12 from a hardware store or Amazon.\n\n\nHere\u2019s a video of me testing various circuits, I misspeak a couple of times.

    "post_text": "So after being a long time apartment dweller, I've recently purchased a house and am learning to do minor improvement related things and such.  However one problem I've run into several times is while screwing in a screw, I manage to strip the head off of it, leaving it stuck only halfway in.  I ordered a screw extractor kit from Amazon and hopefully I'll be able to remove them with this.\n\nThis most recently happened when I was trying to drill a baby gate into a wall, and again while trying to install a J hook on my dock to hang up a life preserver, and yet again while trying to screw in a paper tower holder under a cabinet.\n\nI'm usually using [this cordless screwdriver](https://www.amazon.com/DEWALT-DW920K-2-7-2-Volt-Two-Position-Screwdriver/dp/B000051WQV/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1487942254&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=dewalt+cordless+screwdriver).  I've drilled pilot holes, but most of my drill bits are shorter than the screws I'm using.  I've tried putting a lot of pressure on the screwdriver as I'm drilling the screw in, which helps, but the bit still slips a lot and after a minute or two it's rubbed the head right off.  I also try only squeezing the trigger on the screwdriver a little, so it goes slower.\n\nI'm sure it's probably something simple I'm doing wrong, but I'm just not sure what...\n\nedit:  Thanks for the suggestions everyone.  I ran up to Home Depot and purchased some hex headed screws (I couldn't find any square ones as several people recommend) and a \"magnetic nut driver set\" for them and I'm going to give that a shot later today.",

The walls surrounding the chimney are also not insulated so would have to remove them anyways, so I decided I would remove the chimney at the same time and turn the extra space into a closet. The chimney doesn\u2019t appear to be structural and is essentially free standing. The chimney sticks out of the roof about 6 feet and I was thinking of using a sledgehammer and chisel to take it apart one brick at a time. I may also end up hiring a roofer to patch the missing shingles once I am done. \n\nAny tips or ideas to make things easier would be appreciated!",

    "title": "Is My Apartment Safe?",
    "post_text": "I'm not sure this is the appropriate place for this post, but I'm hoping someone can give me and my fiancee some advice.\n\n[Here are some photos I took](https://imgur.com/a/VwN0IXY)\n\nOn Friday our apartment flooded with sewage and we feel like the rental company might not be handling this in an entirely professional manner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt 2pm on Friday, my fiancee noticed that the bathrooms were filling with water. She had an online meeting coming up so I took over. I turned the water off to the toilets thinking that's where it may have been coming from. Then I called maintenance. They showed up very quickly and called a plumber.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo plumbers show up and sent an auger (plugged into our outlets) down the vent cap outside our living room. About an hour later they move further down the line, open an access hatch, and send an auger that way. It's now been 3 hours and a maintenance worker came and finally shut the water off to the building. The whole time, for 3 hours, our apartment slowly filled with sewage. It seemed to mostly stop after they turned the water off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout two hours later, the plumbers had called in backup. They ended up securing water to the whole apartment complex; 5 separate buildings lost water. In total, after 5 hours (now about 7:30pm), the main line back up was cleared and our bathtub and shower drained. And this whole time we didn't have access to toilets, showers, or our kitchen. I asked the leasing office several times for accommodations, but they refused. They even suggested that we just take our pets for a hike, to which I replied \"You try taking two cats on a hike\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately, the cleaning company wasn't dispatched until 2 hours after I called maintenance (5:30pm; I asked the cleaning guy when he got there). Because of traffic, they didn't show up until nearly 8pm. A supervisor from the rental company had come in to look around, but he spent no more than 5 minutes taking pictures and didn't seem too keen on answering our questions; he seemed to avoid saying if the water was sewage or not. He did say that the cleaning crew would only take about half an hour and that the apartment would be safe to stay in after that. All of which sounded pretty far-fetched to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCleaning crew shows up, vacuums up all the water, and removes the carpet padding that was directly affected. He then laid the carpet back down on the bare concrete (1st floor apartment) and continued working. My fiancee and I didn't actually see them clean the carpet. We were outside talking with neighbors at the time. When I asked, the cleaner said they did what's called a \"biowash\", which we learned was wiping the bathroom floors and tubs with pine-sol and a product called metaclean. He also said they washed the carpet and sprayed an antimicrobial on the baseboards (how much of the carpet they washed and which baseboards were sprayed, I have no idea). They set up two giant fans and a huge dehumidifier before leaving. Fiancee and I didn't feel safe staying, especially with two cats and a dog, so we packed up and headed to her brother's.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to today: We just got off the phone with the property manager and said that the cleaning crew had just come through and did moisture checks after the equipment had been running all weekend. They rearranged the fans, but that was about it. Property manager did say that both bathroom vanities will be replaced, new padding put down, and carpet stretched and put back down and washed again (if it was even done the first time). He also said that they will clean the carpets baseboard-to-baseboard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow here's the kicker. I went through the apartment yesterday to get mail and packages. The cleaning crew never pulled the fridge out to clean, didn't clean around the water heater or adjacent closet space (which is now crusty and smells gross), didn't pull the washer and dryer out to clean the laundry closet, and they didn't check/clean a closet in the master bedroom; all of which are spaces that were directly affected by the sewage flood. The property manager also couldn't tell me where the sewage came from since my toilet and tubs never overflowed. He also said that the vanities would be replaced because of water damage, and the kitchen cabinets likely wouldn't because they weren't damaged by the water; but I tried explaining to him that we are *also* worried about the sewage that hasn't been treated that is now between the walls and under the cabinets. He didn't give me a clear answer or plan to remedy these problems.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy fiancee and I are doing our best to get entirely new carpets throughout the apartment. We also want *someone* to check for sewage between the walls and under our kitchen cabinets. We'll demand that the untreated spots gets attention, of course. But we also want our rent prorated since we don't think it's safe for us to be there, and our electric bill paid covering the days they had the auger and drying equipment hooked up to our outlets. We can't physically be in the apartment anyway because we're both teachers and our school system has started online classes which requires us to constantly be in online video meetings. We can't do this job with fans, dehumidifiers, workers, and construction going on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCan anyone give us any advice? Is the rental company doing what they should be?",

I'll contact an electrician if more work needs to be done I think. Thank you for your help.\n\n*Edit 2* - Since people were asking here is what it looks like in the box: https://imgur.com/a/OI9FyUs\n\nI think I have a much better understanding of what is going on.

    "title": "My Laundry Room Renovation",
    "post_text": "So when I moved into my house this laundry room was a bit of a doozy. There was tons of space to work with, but the sink was tucked away behind the washer, and the space just wasn't very usable. It's a 12x16 room so tons of potential. The old owner also graciously left me a giant slab of quartz countertop with a sink cut out, so of course I utilized it.\n\nThe 1st step was framing in the basement, and creating the bulkhead for the ducting. The one jut out on the wall behind the fridge is a telepost. The room on the other side I wanted a flush wall since its a bedroom, so I had to create two jut outs on the laundry room side around the teleposts, the other being incorporated into the entrance. The wall where the washer and dryer are I extended 2.5 feet as well, which still gave me a 34 inch entrance. I didnt put a door here for a couple reasons. The main one being that the ducting is so low, the door would have been 74 inches high at most. So instead the utility room has a door on the main hallway, and you had to walk through this room anyway to access the laundry so I thought it was fine. \n\nI took down the drop ceiling because A it was ugly, and B didnt go with the ceiling I had planned for the rest of the basement. In its place I put up some pine v joint wood planks. Its natural pine colour, and with the 4\" wide planks it looks really good. I did this through the whole basement, even though its about double the cost of drywall, installation took 1.5 days for ~700 square feet of ceiling. \n\nThe old closet with the open shelves that can be seen in the before photos was right against the concrete with no insulation, so I got rid of that and framed it up and insulated and vapour barrier went up as well. \n\nOnce the framing was done I had an electrician out to wire some outlets to the middle wall, as well as install a second box for a second light. Originally it had one flourescent fixture in the drop ceiling, but I thought 2 flush mount fixtures would look better and brighten up the room as well. He also had to move the light switch since I extended the wall behind the washer and dryer. \n\nI had to move the heat run in the bulkhead as well. Originally it was right over top of what is now the black shelves, and that just made zero sense in that location. So I capped that run, and cut a new hole for the heat register in the ducting in the middle of the room. Pretty simple stuff for the most part, just sheet metal, caulking and screws. \n\nNext was drywall, which was pretty simple. Pretty simple boarding, mud, tape and such. I primed it after the mud and tape was up and did 2 coats of paint and the coverage was great. \n\nI then demo'd the old cabinets and sink/counter top right down to the drywall and floor. This was when the journey started getting tricky. For the cabinets I wanted to go Ikea just for ease of installation. I had acquired the countertop - a nice quartz slab - when I bought the house since the old owner left it. The slab is 108\" long and comes out 38\" the other way from the corner. It was cut to fit an Ikea corner cabinet with lazy susan, 30\" sink cabinet and 24\" base cabinet. However, in March in the pandemic up here is Edmonton, AB, Canada, and all of Canada for that matter, Ikea has slim pickings for base cabinets. I ended up only being able to find a 36\" sink cabinet and a 18\" base cabinet, but the 18\" one was only a 15\" depth. This was the only thing I could make work for the situation, so I went with it. What I ended up doing was framing in a support for the counter to the left of the sink, in the corner. I used 2x2 on the walls, and then framed in the front for the plywood you can see in the photo. With the 2x2 and 5-6 construction screws per length, that support wont go anywhere, especially with the plywood underneath. For the plywood I used 1/2\" premium sanded pine plywood from Home Depot, and you can see it in the corner left of the sink, as well as at the end of the cabinets to cover the hole left from the 15\" depth cabinet. \n\nNext I had to redo the plumbing for the sink since it moved over about 20-24\". I made the main piece of plywood removable since it now covers the shut off valves for the water. I ran a faucet hose from the existing shut off valves into the sink cabinet, and because its an ikea faucet I put in a stop valve under the sink cabinet to act as a coupler, but also easier access to the shut off valves instead of taking off the panel everytime. The drain was easy enough to do, I replaced the old double bowl sink with a new double bowl sink, so I just cut off the old traps and header. Then I added a coupler and an extra length of ABS to get the length I desired. For the hole I just cut out a 4\" circle with a hole saw in the side of the sink cabinet, which allowed for the water supply and drain to run through it. \n\nInstalling the sink was a new adventure, since it was an undermount to quartz. I had never dont undermount before but figured it would be pretty easy. What I didnt realize was installing a 28\" sink in a 36\" cabinet would mean I have no bracing for the sink glue/caulk to set up. So, after thinking about it for a couple minutes I just went and grabbed my 2 ton car jack from the garage, and held the sink in place that way. I applied just enough pressure to hold the sink in place without lifting the counter off the cabinets. It worked like a charm. Once the sink was in place I hooked up the drains and put the faucet on, easy peasy.\n\nThe \"backsplash\" is just some peel and stick wallpaper from Home Depot, but it definitely brought some colour and life to the room. \n\nLast step was the floor - I just painted this grey with an concrete epoxy paint in the slate colourway. $60 can and it looks pretty good. \n\nI also installed the box around the natural gas shutoff valve for the house. For some reason it was in the house, and stuck out 12\" from the wall. So I built a box, drywalled it and put in a spring loaded access panel. \n\nAll in all it was a relatively cheap project, since the quartz came with the house, that was a huge saving. All costs are in Canadian.\n\nCabinets\t350\nSink\t        300\nFaucet\t        100\nPlumbing\t50\nPlywood\t        65\nLumber\t        150\nDrywall\t        225\nMud and tape and beads\t50\nHeat ducting\t30\nWallpaper\t60\nCeiling\t        250\nElectrical work\t225\nLights\t        80\nFloor paint\t60\nWall paint and primer\t40\n\nFor a total cost of $2035. \n\nThe sink is a Blanco undermount double bowl stainless steel from Lowes.\n\nCabinets are the Ikea base cabinets with the Askersund front. \n\nSink faucet is the Almaren without the pull out spout from Ikea.\n\nEverything else was purchased at Home Depot.\n\n\nLet me know what you think, and ask any questions you might have. I did the reno with all the cabinet shortages going on right now and had to get creative so ask away.\n\n[Laundry Room](http://imgur.com/a/PJBY1Xa)",

    "title": "Good damn you previous owners! How hard would it have been to caulk the base boards, in the bathrooms at the very least!",
    "post_text": "Sorry ahead of time for typos, on mobile in my bed, annoyed. \n\nI moved into a new house just 4 weeks ago. The house as a whole is very sound, but the previous owners did every \"update\" as cheap as possible. Painting an accent wall? why use masking tape when you could have crooked lines? Flooring? How about we find some peel and stick laminate wood to put over the existing peel and stick vinyl tile? Things like that. \n\nWell, one of the first things I noticed was they just tacked cheap, plain base board around the entire house. They didn't bother to cover the nails and, more importantly didn't apply any caulking. I'm a huge proponent of caulking. The seal keeps water from traveling into the walls *ahem*, it keeps pests from coming in, and helps maintain thermal efficiency. I thought it was a standard practice to do with base boards, but not for these people. It was a minor annoyance that I knew I would have to fix when I redid the floors, but I didn't think it would bite me so fast. I installed a toilet seat bidet 3 weeks ago. It seemed fine, I kept paper towel under it for a couple days to verify it wasn't leaking. All was good, but this morning I noticed a small puddle behind the toilet. It was a moderate drip coming from where bidet hooks into the toilet tank. I turned off the water supply at the wall and sopped up the water. It wasn't much. I didn't think any more of it and went to work. Tonight I went to the utility room directly under the bathroom (2nd floor) and saw the wet stain going down the wall. Luckily this is the laundry room with a floor drain and the room is unfinished so I can see all the studs. The other half of the water went toward the garage which I'm in the process of finishing. This water wrecked the only drywall that was up that I was planning on keeping, so again not a huge set back. I just get to dry wall and insulate all four walls now instead of just three :/. I figure the leak was present for less than 24 hrs before I found it and was probably only a few gallons total. It is crazy how fast the obvious damage can spread. And began soaking into the drywall downstairs. \n\nLong story short. If the assholes had just caulked the base boards, it would have prevented the water from sneaking downstairs covertly out of view behind the toilet. Instead it would have just pooled to the middle of the bathroom where I would have noticed it asap and could easily mop it up if the linoleum.\n\nAnyways, thanks for listening to my late night vent, it'll help me sleep a little easier.\n\nTl;dr Don't be lazy, caulk your base boards. It'll save you (and future owners) from trouble down the road.\n\n\nEdit: As some of you have pointed out, I learned that caulking base boards is not the norm. I just moved from a cheap cookie cutter house that was built in 2012. At that house they caulked between the base board and linoleum in all the \"wet\" areas (kitchen, laundry, baths). The builders of these kinds of houses are not known for going the extra mile, so I incorrectly assumed it was a standard practice. However, it is one I will continue going forward because it guards against little instances like this. In the old house I dropped a bottle of fish sauce (or rice vinegar? It was something smelly) that shattered and went all over the floor. It was stopped by the caulking and easy to mop up. I could only imagine how long the smell would have lingered if it got under the base board and into the wall.\n\nThanks for all your insights and stories, good luck on all your projects!",

    "title": "Prefabricated steam showers/tubs: my experience installing and using one.",
    "post_text": "There's not much info out there about pre-made steam showers, so I figured I'd share my experience. **TLDR: They're a great deal, and ours is a pleasure to use. Installing it was a pain.**\n\nMost steam showers are custom builds: you buy a steam generator and the separate components and then build a whole room around them. It costs a bomb. Instead we got a prefabricated one that assembles into a self-enclosed unit that you (theoretically) just slide into place in an existing bathroom, for a fraction of the cost.\n\nIt seems there are 3 or 4 companies in the US that sell these. They probably all get their inventory from the same factory in China. We ordered ours from a company called Aquapeutics. The employees I've talked to have been very friendly and knowledgeable, although perhaps not as quick to respond as I'd like. Our shower has a whirlpool tub and handheld showerheads in addition to the steam option. It looks like this: https://i.imgur.com/Y52bQHO.jpg\n\nThe plan was to convert two existing bedrooms into a master bed/bath on the upper floor of our mid-century 2-story house in Minneapolis. I normally do projects like this myself, but we contracted this one out. _(Edit: We designed the bathroom with juuust enough room to accommodate the shower, a toilet, and sink. The big honking shower unit in a teeny bathroom looks hilarious. We call the shower the Time Machine or the Tardis.)_\n\nThe shower arrived on time in two enormous wooden crates, that the freight truck deposited in our garage. We didn't have any issues with shipping damage.\n\nOur first impression, and the impression of our contractors, was that the materials are of very good quality. Our plumber hadn't seen one of these before and was really skeptical, expecting the materials to be cheap and shoddy, but he was impressed.\n\nMany of the parts are pre-assembled. The whole tub/base is one big piece, and it wouldn't fit up our stairs. We took off the ceiling's drywall, then stared cutting into joists, then just ended up cutting open the whole ceiling to move the joists altogether. Not the manufacturer's fault, but something to keep in mind.\n\nThe instructions are very poorly-translated. None of the steps are particularly complicated, but it took a lot of extra time to figure things out.\n\nThe manufacturer's specs are almost nonexistent, so until we got the physical components we couldn't really make much of an installation plan, or figure out if everything would be up to code. It turns out the supplied drain wasn't up to code, at least not in Minneapolis. The drain is flexible, which is presented as a selling point on the company's website because it means you don't have to fix the shower in place \u2014 you can assemble it away from the wall and then slide it to where you want it. Since that's not up to code we ended up having to buy the parts ourselves to \"hard-pipe\" the drain. Any time we want to access all the wires/pipes, which are on the back of the shower, we have to come through the ceiling of the first floor and cut out the drain, then replace it when we're done.\n\n_(Edit: After passing inspection with the hard p-trap, I replaced it with [this flexible one from Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/p/SIMPLE-DRAIN-1-25-in-Rubber-Threaded-P-Trap-Bathroom-Single-Sink-Drain-Kit-3EA-1V2-TC0/313608432). Now I can pull it out from the wall no problem.)_\n\nWe noticed some little things that we think were pre-assembly mistakes:\n\n- A rubber drain hose was attached onto the main drain pipe, but it wasn't secured with a clamp and could just fall off. Not a biggie: we added a clamp.\n- The hoses for the foot massager and the left showerhead seem to have gotten mixed up \u2014 the massager hose is too short and the showerhead hose is too long. So we ended up hooking the massager hose to the showerhead's knob/valve and vice-versa. A little annoying. _(Edit: I was able to fix this myself, no problem. The connections are threaded on with compression nuts, so I just swapped the connections.)_\n- The top whirlpool jets on both sides don't seem to be affected by the air control valve, so they're on full blast at all times. Unless the tub is filled, they keep blasting out pockets of air and make a lot of noise. _(Edit: The company says they are working as expected. Meh. 3 years later and we rarely use the jets. My kids love them though because they make bubble bath foam up like crazy!)_\n\nI contacted the company about these issues on Monday and am waiting for a response.\n\nUsing the shower is *great*, though! The steam and shower functionalities work great. The electronic components all seem to work fine too, albeit are a bit confusing. My wife loves it and the kids could spend all day in it.\n\nMy only criticisms, other than the above, are very minor:\n\n- The \"foot massager\" is basically just a box with two thin streams of water that shoot out of some rubber nubs. Not super useful, unless I'm missing something.\n- The \"acupuncture\" jets on the shower walls are a little weak.\n- The shampoo/toiletry holders are a little too big for me, so it's easy to knock bottles out of them.\n\nIt also has some perks that I didn't really expect:\n\n- It contains sound very well. (For some reason the sound of the built-in radio really carries through the house, but sound from inside the shower itself does not.)\n- It's quite watertight, so we can hose off our 3-year-old twins without getting water all over the bathroom.\n\nHappy to answer any questions.\n\nEdit: I thought the company was being really bad about responding, but it turns out they're having trouble with their email server \u2014 they've actually been very responsive, just getting caught in my spam filter! They've requested replacement parts from the factory.\n\nUpdate: As of June 2024, we still love it, and use it every day with zero issues and no repairs or changes whatsoever! Soap scum on the black plastic has been a much smaller issue than expected -- although that could be due to having twin boys in kindergarten and therefore not much mental capacity to notice things like that, haha.",

    "post_text": "So I got the idea of mounting a bike rack in my basement. It's one of those with a bunch of bike hooks screwed into a 2x4 and then the 2x4 is screwed into the studs behind the drywall, 2 screws per wall stud. Through hole was drilled in the 2x4, used 3\" screws, stupid me forgot to drill pilot holes into the drywall/wall stud.\n\nLong story short is as I was drilling into one of the wall studs I hit something with about 1/2\" left in the screw. Thinking it was a knot in the wood I proceeded to try to sink the rest of the screw in. With no real success, I figured pull it out. When the I pace driver could get it out I used my screwdriver. I got concerned when I had a real hard time getting the screw out. I managed after taking it super slow.\n\nI soon found out that water lines among other things are ran through studs. Now I'm super concerned that I hit a pipe in the stud.\n\nSo my question is: what could I have hit while driving into the stud? And what is likelihood that I hit a water line? How can I check if I did (or didn't) hit a water line without ripping the wall apart?",

    "title": "Need Help Installing Gymnastics Rings at Home",
    "post_text": "Hi,\n\nSo, as the title suggests, Im looking for some help/instruction wrt how to setup my gymnastics rings. Have bought these super cool gymrings + hangboard contraption and cannot wait (for those curious -  [https://musclemountain.store/product/exercise-rings-with-hangboard/](https://musclemountain.store/product/exercise-rings-with-hangboard/))\n\nSo now, I have this space out at back and was thinking of fixing them onto the roof. In the images attached -  I'm looking to have a rod go along the entire length of the drawn yellow line. (just shy of 20 feet). Rod would be best as I can move around on the rod (position) isn't fixed ..  and there's enough room to hang a few more things/people.\n\nImages - [https://imgur.com/a/gqpI3Jk](https://imgur.com/a/gqpI3Jk)\n\nFirst, I thought of using anchor bolts/hooks etc and fitting them to the roof. Decided against this as the point of fixation can never be moved.\n\nNow,  I've got 2 options:\n\n1. I've been told the best option is an I Section beam ([https://5.imimg.com/data5/RI/GJ/MY-6038067/i-section-beam-500x500.jpg](https://5.imimg.com/data5/RI/GJ/MY-6038067/i-section-beam-500x500.jpg)) as it's super strong.  Told to break into the wall and just fix these.Im against the wall damage and wondering if the rope/webbing used w the rings would fray on this.\n2. Second is to fix a metallic plate of sorts to the roof (along the yellow line) and have a rod hang underneath that is connected to the side walls and to the plate on top.\n\nI'm looking for tried and tested options and I am against heavy damage to the walls etc. As less drilling as possible, would be best.   \nAny suggestions on:  \n\\- Entire setup  \n\\- Material of rod/pole that I can use for this (worried about strength and sag in the middle)  \n\\- Additional equipment I could use to strengthen\n\nTIA",

    "post_text": "Hey there!\n\nPictures first: [Pictures!](https://imgur.com/a/mTk7IIz)\n\n**Super quick recap:** Bought house 3 years ago, smoker house so we had so much more work than expected. We managed to just about make the living room area (500sqft) livable but neglected many tasks, made some stupid decisions and so on. We finally finished it up.\n\nBefore christmas we wanted to finally do it right:\n\n* sand the floor, repair some parts - no stain but 3 coats of clear varnish\n   * you still see all the issues of the past 50+ years, every water damage, every nick. but its smooth and sealed - we decided on that look\n* sand all the skirting boards down to wood and re oil\n* seal and detail all the windows (there was overpaint from 30 years ago still on there)\n* deep clean the radiators\n* paint room and ceiling\n* install new 9w led spots with warm light, color and a neat control panel\n* remove the entire radiator in front of the big window!! this changes the entire feel of the room and is sooo comfy\n* install better thermometers for the 2 other radiators to make sure they work right behind the covers\n* switch eating/living room area around (see pictures)\n* build a lamp! and then build another lamp! out of old lamp related items (see pictures)\n* buy new furniture (brown and old/used!) -&gt; clean, sand/oil where applicable :)\n\nI think that is all we did. Definetely some learnings again:\n\n* A (good) leather couch with thick leather works just fine with 4 cats and a dog. Should have spent on this sooner. The old fabric one was....iffy, after only 3 years.\n* The radiator in front of the window was installed \\~10 years after the house was build and just hooked into the existing system with no change in pump power or so. removing it improved the temperature for the entire house and living room is still just as warm.The new view is just awesome!\n* Sitting on the couch during sunrise/sunset, watching the cats and birds at the pond is really relaxing\n* we really do not need a typical \"tv wall\" setup\n* good (still somewhat cheap) spotlights vs. cheap spotlights is such a difference!\n* Building lamps is awesome, we love lamps :)\n* Poufs are awesome too! Need 2 more!\n* We ran out of furniture money. So only the living room area is fully one style. The eating area is the old \"modern country\" furniture we bought originally. I think it actually works somewhat - we will revisit that later next year most likely\n* We hate hand sanding feet upon feet of skirting boards (there's 2!!)....but it worked out perfect and wood is expensive :)\n* Next time, we will stain the floor too\n\nLet us know what you think ! :)",

It's very nice, magnetic, but now I need a lightweight and stiff backing to attach it to.\n\nOne person suggested foam board, but I don't think it would hold up, since I am going to be mounting the whiteboard on hooks so I can take it up and down from the wall easily and frequently: my preschool-aged children use this to practice writing/drawing (so it needs to be able to withstand some abuse!). Similarly, cardboard would not work.\n\nUsing a large sheet of corrugated plastic (like what people use for yard signs) would work perfectly, but the problem is I can't find a single sheet that is 24 in by 36 in. I found packets of 5+ sheets in that size online, and stores around here sell single sheets, but they aren't the right size.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nThank you!",

    "title": "Kitchen Renovation Project",
    "post_text": "Our house is a 1929 center-hall. We moved in back in 2009 and we generally liked the kitchen, which had been redone probably some time in the 90s or maybe the early 2000s. However, over the years we began to have a growing list of things we wanted to resolve. This project commenced October 19, 2020 and was completed December 23, 2020.\n\nIf you want to skip to the pretty stuff, here are the photos (the preview image on this post is the \u201cbefore\u201d):\n\nPart 1 [https://imgur.com/a/QcMAIpq](https://imgur.com/a/QcMAIpq)  \nPart 2 [https://imgur.com/a/LOctZ73](https://imgur.com/a/LOctZ73)\n\n**The sins of the original kitchen:**\n\n* The cabinets and drawers, while looking nice on the front, were just pressboard and veneer. The shelves were 'bubbled' where wet glasses or dishes had been set down, and the bottoms of the drawers had been repeatedly stapled and glued to try and keep them together. It wasn't uncommon for a drawer to get stuck because a frying pan had slid through the *back* of the drawer.\n* The countertop was a cheap laminate and had been cracked and melted in one area (which the previous owners had painted and covered when we bought the house).\n* The wall color was not to our liking, but my wife didn't want to paint it until we redid the whole thing.\n* There were too many outlets and switches, most of which had been improperly installed, filled with grout, and set at mismatched heights.\n* The in-wall oven had broken down repeatedly and was a major hassle to repair. It stopped working after three burner replacements and a replacement control box in 2019.\n* The cabinet under the sink had been flooded so many times that it was basically a bucket instead of a flat surface. The disposal died and flooded the whole thing again right before the renovation began, so I simply removed it myself and re-attached the pipes in the mean time.\n* The microwave was starting to go, but the backsplash had been grouted to it, which would have made it tough to replace.\n* The lazy susan area in the corner was both poor for storage and also created a pointlessly deep countertop.\n* The flooring was a blonde, seriously fake looking wood laminate that looked dumb next to the actual hardwood of the dining room.\n* The fridge blocked the doorway when opened.\n\nSo we set about a plan to renovate. We got recommendations for contractors and called five of them. Only four of them actually replied. Only three of those actually showed up to look at the space. Only two of them actually gave us a quote after visiting. One of those two was not only in our price range, but a really nice guy and super responsive to calls or texts, which was a great sign. We gave the job to Solid Property Solutions, and they served as our general contractor for everything but the cabinetry.\n\nWe decided that if we were going to do this at all, we wanted to install something that wasn't going to fall apart, that could be refinished if necessary, and that future owners wouldn't need to rip out. I contacted Pleasant Valley Woodworking, an Amish company that had done my boss's entire kitchen. We visited their workshop and picked out a Shaker style cabinet (fewer grooves and edges than our old ones, making them easier to keep clean), as well as a countertop. \n\nDesign-wise we basically sorted it out ourselves and just got some ideas from the cabinetry guy. Given the oddities of our room layout, we really couldn't do anything *too* radically different, and we already had a relatively new fridge and dishwasher, so we knew we'd be getting the matching model microwave and a slide-in range/oven.\n\nThe choice to use two different contractors, one being Amish, was a bit of a pain in the ass, honestly. The cabinet company could only be contacted by phone, mail, and fax... no email, no text. They actually hung up our project quite a bit because they failed to tell us that the cabinets were ready, which meant I'd already missed the summer slots with our primary contractor. The project was intended to start in the spring of 2020 and didn't end up starting until closer to Halloween. I also wasn't thrilled with their installers, who made some careless errors, including failing to put valves on the water pipes they cut to install the sink cabinet which caused some water damage to the subfloor. The owner of the cabinet company and his main team were very nice, but choosing them definitely added some hassles I hadn't planned for. Thankfully, our other contractor was an absolute angel and he and his guys went above and beyond at every turn.\n\nBudget-wise we started off aiming for $25k or so, but once we had quotes we realized we'd need to go a bit higher. There is a local program here called the Heritage Home Loan Program run by the Cleveland Restoration Society which helps people with older homes like ours get special low-rate loans for renovation work. We were able to secure a 2% 10yr fixed loan from Key Bank through this program. At the same time, we refinanced our mortgage with Key... this was pre-pandemic, Dec. 2019 or so, but the rates had gone down since we bought so it made sense to do that before taking out a kitchen loan. We ended up doing a $36k loan, and with appliances and all I'd say the whole project came in around $40k.\n\nIn the end, the savings on the mortgage plus my wife's recent payoff of her student loan made the entire kitchen something of a wash to our monthly budget, which was awesome. The pandemic actually turned out to be something of a plus for us because we were able to be home throughout the project, had extra money because we weren't able to go anywhere or do anything else, and didn't have to worry about hosting family holidays or other gatherings during the remodel. The only big pain, aside from the mask-wearing, was that our flooring was delayed and dragged our timeline. We also had limited choices of where to order the appliances due to short supplies.\n\n**Various Products Used**\n\n* Ravello Bianco Dolomite countertop -- My wife wanted something natural and neutral-colored, so this ruled out quartz and also most of the granite options. We're very happy with our choice. Granex of Solon OH did the installation and supply. They made some mistakes, but they did come back and fix them in a timely fashion.\n* [Coretec Vesta flooring](https://coretecfloors.com/en-us/products/coretec-stone/vesta-vv568-18363) \\-- I got this through a friend at Marshall Carpet, so it was 258 sq ft at about $1700. We did not want anything that simulated wood, so the stone style really worked well.\n* Elements Brixton subway 3x12 tile -- Also from Marshall Carpet. Given the period of our house, we thought this would suit nicely. We have a white subway tile surround in our shower that we like. We picked a gray grout because it wouldn't look dirty all the time. I got  37 ft for $260, but we actually ended up tiling less of the wall I had anticipated, so I have several extra boxes of this tile and the trim pieces.\n* [Quoizel GF1717PN Griffin Semi-Flush Ceiling Light](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0035Q2S10/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n* [IKEA RANARP led track light](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/ranarp-ceiling-track-3-spotlights-off-white-70346098/)\n* [Toto Aquia Iv 1G Two-Piece Elongated Dual Flush Toilet](https://www.wayfair.com/home-improvement/pdp/toto-aquia-iv-1g-two-piece-elongated-dual-flush-10-and-08-gpf-skirted-toilet-with-cefiontect-with-toilet-seat-wax-ring-and-toilet-mounting-bolts-sbsa1423.html) \\-- We had a 14\" rough and a rather small bathroom, so to get an elongated bowl *and* leave anything close to the required room in front, we only had a couple of choices. This one had a neat adapter that allowed us to get it closer to the wall than most. Overall I'm happy with this toilet, although the low water level and the flatter bowl means we end up cleaning it a lot more often.\n* [InSinkErator Evolution Compact 3/4 HP Continuous Feed Garbage Disposal](https://www.wayfair.com/home-improvement/pdp/insinkerator-evolution-compact-34-hp-continuous-feed-garbage-disposal-ink1159.html?&amp;experiencetype=2&amp;selectedvertical=3)\n* [KitchenAid 6.5 cu. ft.

I honestly miss having him and his guys around the house. Here are some of the problems we ran into along the way though:\n\n* The flooring was delayed, which threw off our timeline by at least a month. We also discovered that we had ordered a lot of extra threshold trim, rather than ordering stair nosing. The flooring guys used the threshold as nosing before realizing what was up. When the nosing arrived, we figured out that it was designed to be flush with the stair rather than added on top, so we had to cut into the already-mounted stair treads and such to get the nosing attached. It required some glue and tiny nails, and even now it squeaks a bit because the underlying stairs aren't really flat enough, but it looks nice. Also, the 'quarter round' they sell turned out to be more like a baseboard and my flooring guys had to rip the edge off to create an actual piece of quarter round for the trim.\n* The decorative 'feet' to the cabinetry made the flooring complicated as well. My contractor actually fired the first flooring subcontractor within an hour of his arrival on that Friday morning and had two others come give quotes before settling on someone else, who was there and working on Monday morning. Basically it was a question of how to install the flooring without having to cut the cabinetry to slide it underneath. The guy who actually did the job simply cut smaller pieces of the flooring to fill in the gaps and it looks perfect.\n* The one wall between the stairwell and the kitchen was really thin. We were moving all of the light switches to that side of the wall, so the electrician had to jam the ceiling fan switch, kitchen light switch, garage light switch (which had been in the basement under a staircase before) and back hallway light into a single shallow panel. I'm impressed that he pulled it off, really. Finally having access to turn the garage lights on without going into the back of the basement has been really great.\n* We hired a plumber to hook up the water for the fridge, the sink and dishwasher, and the new gas line for the oven. On the first visit, the guy did the dishwasher, disposal, fridge line, and faucet, but he didn't have the parts he needed to do the gas line and had to reschedule for a second visit. The second visit turned out to be a different plumber from the same company, who apparently hadn't gotten good notes from the first guy and came out expecting to just do an oven hookup, not to install a new gas line, so he wasn't prepared either. I did have him replace the water valves in my basement which had been dripping since his predecessor had been over. He said he'd get the parts and come back. He ended up leaving about $3000 worth of tools in my basement by mistake and had to come back the next day. Finally, a third guy came and hooked up the new line and attached our oven at last. That guy left his coat and cigarettes and came back a week later for them. Sheesh.\n* When the Moen faucet first went in, the water wouldn't turn off. We contacted Moen and they sent a new control box, which arrived a week later and installed easily. It's been great since then.\n* We discovered some unexpectedly nasty water damage in one wall/ceiling. We had already planned to re-drywall that area because the plaster was jacked up from previous cabinets and things being screwed into it, but we weren't entirely prepared for the replacement wood required underneath. We're glad we found and fixed all that.\n* We had a cracked backsplash tile that had to be removed and re-done after everything had set.\n* While the walls were open in the stairwell, I decided it would be a good idea to run ethernet from the basement to the second floor so I could get a router up in the attic where our family room is. That turned out to be a bigger project than I'd expected, including buying a $60 3ft bit (which I gifted to my contractor), and threading a totally new cable after the end tore off the original one as it came through the wall.\n* We still have a bunch of extra flooring pieces, cabinet trim, tile, and other detritus hanging around in our garage which I'm not really sure what to do with. :)\n\nOverall we are really happy with the outcome and love being in the kitchen. We have tons of storage space, working appliances, drawers and cabinets that close softly and are made of actual wood, and some new light fixtures that really brighten it all up.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions or take closer pics of anything you want to know more about.",

    "post_text": "Disclosure: This is a cross-post from /r/pestcontrol. There are significantly more readers here and I'm hoping to gather as much advice as possible. \n\nTwo days ago I noticed about five larvae in my downstairs bathroom sink. At the time it looked like it could be ants, so I laid a trap and kept an eye on it. I washed the other larvae down the drain. Fewer and fewer would show up (only two today), but I was bothered by the tiny bits of grit that were forming between the sink and the wall. I put a folded PostIt underneath the mirror at that spot, and when I checked a few hours later there was new grit in the PostIt. I took off the bathroom mirror, but didn't see any immediate damage in the wall. When I looked closer at one of the hooks that holds the mirror at the bottom, it seemed a little dirty compared to the others. When I took it off I found this: https://imgur.com/6UGxJTU\n\nI'm feeling very confident the insect in this photo is a termite. My question is: Since I just found this, and since the numbers seem to be low, is this something I could reasonably treat on my own? I'm in eastern NC. If it helps, I have not spotted or discovered any termites in the lawn, and have had no previous issues with termites or pests aside from some stray ants (and a tiny lizard that snuck in once). This is a new discovery.",

    "title": "Soundproofing/dampening Dorm Room Door?",
    "post_text": "(This is my first post on Reddit, so sorry if I'm bad at the community norms.)\n\nMy dorm is a bit weird. It's connected to the room next door by a door that's permanently locked but also not secured into the space where it sits particularly well. You can see the light from the room next door between the frame and the wall, as well as between the frame and the door. I don't know why my school doesn't brick the space up, but whatever. That's not something I can change.\n\nI had this configuration last year, and it was miserable. I could hear EVERYTHING my neighbor did and said. She'd have guests over at like 11pm when I was trying to sleep, which I'd ask her not to do, but she kept at it. It was like having the world's worst roommate but not being able to share a fridge or borrow their shampoo and only getting the noise. This year, it's the same deal, but my neighbor seems like he might be worse. Last night, he had friends over at like 2am, then had a friend over again at 7am. He was also typing probably all night, and his keyboard is loud enough that I can hear it like we're in the same room. We live on the designated \"quiet floor\" (not my choice, but still nice), but this guy is always having guests over, and they talk so loud. Worse yet, he seems to never leave. His friends always come here. This wouldn't be so bothersome, but it's the everyday noises that are really disruptive, like typing and even sighing. I know from last year that it's even worse when the neighbor brings home a special somebody. It's like being in the room with them, and that is *not* something I signed up for.\n\nSo, **TL;DR**, I need to soundproof/dampen for voices (I'd say he's about a tenor, as are most of his friends) and loud typing (like my-laptop-is-clunky-and-old and/or super-aggressive-typing loud). It'd be nice to block out some sounds of drawers being opened and roughly closed, but those are less frequent. The door is in a little nook-ish area off the main square of my room, flush with the two walls beside it and the ceiling, about 9x3' (guestimated based on my 5'6\" height). Ceiling is I think foam tile? (those light-weight tiles used in every school), the walls are painted brick, and the door frame is metal. Pictures linked: http://imgur.com/a/q299a (Please pardon the dresser and mess. I'm still organizing my things and messed up my arm a bit moving my other furniture to get my bed away from the noise, and so didn't want to push it moving the dresser.)\n\n**The hitch**: I need to not damage the school's property in any way. So no drilling, no gluing. Command strips and hooks are basically all I have to work with for attaching things to the wall/door frame. I would also like to keep material costs low (student budget), as well as the sheer amount of material because I live on the other side of the country and so have to figure out a way to store this construction during breaks.\n\nMy school's residential life office is also run by cheapskates who are absolutely incompetent at making students' comfortable, considering what room and board costs (I'd use harsher words, but that'd escalate real quick). So they're not help, and they'd probably charge me if I tried caulking the door on my own, and I can't afford that on Wisconsin minimum wage.\n\nI was thinking of constructing something that I can fold up, perhaps something in two layers. I thought I might create a grid of squares of some thicker material, like a dense foam, and use felt glued to the foam to connect each square to one other so that they fold onto each other and can be stored that way. I could then somehow tack the squares not permanently attached to each other, together, when I install it. I would then attach a large span of sound-dampening fabric (felt was indicated as an option in a lot of my research, but I also read a mention of using denim and would certainly be open to suggestion of fabrics, or even combinations of fabrics to use in layers) about an inch or so in front of the foam construction, using the air in between as further soundproofing.\nA poorly-drawn example of my sort of first-draft idea: http://imgur.com/KyvpwsX\n\nI'm a bit new at soundproofing, although I've done quite a few of these little dorm-friendly construction projects in the past, so any help is really appreciated. Basically, I need help on the plan for this thing, as well as securing it in place. And I'd like to keep this project under $50, or at least as close to that as possible.",

    "title": "Think I'm getting ripped off by a contractor, need a sanity check?",
    "post_text": "I'm having an 8'x8' bathroom remodeled by a general contractor, and I'd like to get a sanity check on some things.  I have an older home (built in the 1920s) in a nice area of town.  The remodel is a complete remodel, turn-key except that I'm doing the painting.  The price was around $12k, and included demoing the old bathroom, and tearing it down to the studs to replace the plaster with sheet rock, and moving some plumbing to make better use of the space.  The fixtures are all new and pretty good quality.\n\nI'm pretty comfortable with the original quote, but we've made a few changes throughout the process, and I feel like I'm really getting ripped off on the change orders.  They are as follows:\n\n* $950 to remediate some mold where our previous faucet leaked.\n* $600 to remediate more mold where our previous toilet was.\n* $400 to insulate an outward-facing wall with 2x2 framing and sheets of foam insulation (we didn't realize the plaster was the only thing between the paint and the brick, so this wasn't in the original quote).\n* $450 to repair some drywall in my basement ceiling that was damaged by the water leak.\n* $125 to move a lightswitch from the outside wall of the bathroom to an adjacent wall inside bathroom, before the drywall was hung and the electrician was already at my house doing other work.\n\nI agreed to these prices before he did the work, so I may be on the hook for them anyway.  And yes, I'm a fucking idiot.\n\nMy problem with the first mold charge is that he found it while I was at work, and I ok-ed the fix, so I never got to see any evidence that it was there.  His charges were broken down into two $250 \"treatments\" with \"special chemicals\".  The area looks like he spray painted it white. The other $450 or so was for \"removal\" of 120 lbs of \"contaminated material\".  He claims he took it to a special place that disposes of medical waste, not the dump, and charged me $3.80 per pound to dispose of it.  I called the dump here and they said moldy drywall or plaster might be considered hazardous waste if the mold was black mold, which they take for $100 per ton.  I brought this up to my contractor and he stuck to his guns, saying they won't take it, and he doesn't even try to take it there any more.  I asked him to provide receipts for the disposal, which he said he will provide, but hasn't.  He also says the \"chemicals\" he used can't be bought at stores and are why the cost is so high.  This all sounds like bullshit to me.  Before I came to this conclusion, he found some more mold where the old tub drain used to be.  There was no moisture there, but I agreed to pay him to remove that too.  When I got home and saw the work that he did, it just didn't line up with how much he was charging me.  It just didn't look like $1550 work of work or materials.\n\nThe next thing was the insulation of the wall, which, while he probably overcharged me, I can live with.  This was one 8'x8' wall, where he installed 2x2s and sheets of foam insulation.\n\nThe quote to fix the drywall was based on the idea that they would remove about 40 sqauare feet of drywall on the ceiling (which boxes in my HVAC vents) and repair the area.  The drywall guy came today to drywall the bathroom and this was supposed to be something he did on the side, that was unrelated to the bathroom.  He ended up being able to repair the area with just mud and tape, and didn't have to replace any of the drywall.  The drywaller mentioned he was being paid by the day, and so I know this extra work didn't cost my contractor anything, and wasn't what the agreement was based on.  If I were in his shoes, I would not charge me anything, because the work didn't cost him anything.  I haven't asked him what he wants to do about this yet.  I suspect he quoted me a high price in the first place because he damaged 3 adjacent walls during the demo and was responsible for fixing them, and so I assume he's trying to offset his cost by overcharging me for the drywall repair to the ceiling.  I should be clear here and say that the $450 was on top of the $750 that was included in the original bid to drywall the bathroom itself.  The drywaller said his daily rate is $400 and he was paid for the day.  I think the repair I'm being asked to pay $450 for took him less than an hour and required only mud and tape. \n\nThe last thing was moving the light switch.  I could see this being expensive if the walls weren't already stripped down to the studs with the electrician there working already.  He told me the electrician would charge him at least $125 to move the switch.  This is partly my fault, because when we were talking about doing it, I asked him if it would cost extra and I think a lightbulb turned on in his head and he realized he could charge me for it.\n\nHe also forgot to have the first electrician install an exhaust fan for my bathroom, which is why the electrician was here today. Again, I think he's trying to charge me for the switch to offset the cost of having to bring out an electrician for the second time.  He also just wants to vent the fan into the attic, which I think is a bad idea, and I'm not even sure it's up to code.\n\nI'm hoping some of you guys can weigh in on this stuff and just give a sanity check.  Am I getting ripped off?  What should I do about it?  I've tried talking to the guy and I think he's just a dishonest guy trying to squeeze every last dollar out of me.  He was willing to knock the mold remediation for both areas down to about $1150 total, which still seems like craziness.  I haven't spoken to him about the drywall repair or the lightswitch, aside from originally agreeing to his prices.\n\nI'm pretty ignorant about this stuff, which is why I hired a contractor in the first place.  I obviously have a track record of agreeing to stupid stuff up front, and then realizing how stupid I'm being.  What I really want is to just sit down with the guy and have an honest discussion about what work got done on these things and how much it is really worth, but I'm not sure if that will get me anywhere.  I almost want a mediator or some unbiased 3rd party to arbitrate a discussion, because all I really want is to be treated fairly.",

Most everything was fine and we're safe, but we did get some water coming in per here from parts of our concrete block foundation: https://imgur.com/a/6jojmtD\n\nBasically, our HOA told us they'll be extending their gutters from our house to prevent it from happening. They said they're on the hook for any foundational damage that occurs in the units, but generally in the other units that reported similar issues in the past they monitored it for a year and determined the house was settled. I did pre-emptively call a contractor, who said basically the same thing: gutters are most important, make sure the downspout is far enough away, and that should solve the problem over any work on the wall itself.\n\nI'm going to scrub the walls with some vinegar and then detergent in case there's any mold, and some internet research seems to confirm what I've been told. Does this all track, or is there any evidence we should hire a structural engineer and push this further? And should I still caulk or seal the cracks, or is it sorta useless? The photos show the worst of what happened, and I took that way after the worst downpours of the night - if that's true, it sounds like we should just wait for the gutter and monitor. But I'm also wildly new to this, so any advice is appreciated! (We're also getting a shop vac in case anything ever gets worse...)",

    "post_text": "All of the sudden one day, our dryer wouldn't dry. It heats up, but the clothes were all still soaked after multiple dryer cycles. So i looked online and figured the blower wheel must be broken as it isn't spinning and sucking the moisture out of the dryer. I ordered some parts from repair clinic and when i got them, we took the dryer apart. We found a ton of lint and vacuumed it all out. The reasons i found online were that the blower wheel connection can strip over time and the wheel no longer spins with the rotation of the motor. Well when i got it all apart and cleaned, the blower wheel was in perfect condition and spun without issue when the motor spun, so i didn't replace any parts. So after thoroughly cleaning it and even stripping all the hair that was stuck to the drum rollers, everything seemed to be functioning. When i hooked it back up and tested it, it seemed to run fine.\n\n A few days later I removed the dryer vent from the wall and used a vent cleaning pole with a brush at the end and shoved it up the house venting. A $hit ton of lint came falling out and i went up as far as i could. (Our dryer vent goes up to the roof. Common Florida build) I figured it got it all cleaned out so i hooked it back up and figured everything that could be done was done. a few days and loads later it had been drying the clothes fine, albeit no faster than before but heard some water sloshing around when i was running it. I didn't know where it was coming from so i just figured it was the sound of the unclogged dryer sucking all the water moisture out of the clothes. Well that wasn't the case. I unhooked the dryer vent from the dryer and it felt really heavy, so i unhooked it from the wall and there was a massive amount of water collected in the metal accordion tube that goes from the dryer to the wall. I dumped it out in the basin sink so hooked it all back up. \n\nMy concern was that i had pushed the cleaning pole too far and popped the vent hood off of the roof leaving an exposed pipe and rain was coming in. I can\u2019t ge tons he roof, my ladder isnt tall enough, but from a distance i can see the vent hood and it appeared to be intact. So i went up into the crawl space above the house and checked the piping. Well there is a point where the pipe is intentionally elbowed at maybe a 45 degree angle before it hits the roof. All of it was intact so i figured i didn\u2019t damage anything but i am thinking that the cleaning pole couldn\u2019t manuever that bend, so i wasnt actually at the top of the pipe and that section could still be clogged. \n\nThe dryer isnt drying worth a damn and every couple of days i have to empty the water out of the vent hose. The flow sense meter fills up indicating bad air flow after 15 minutes of drying and the whole laundry room has a lot of hot moisture in it now. And now the dryer will just shut off randomly mid-cycle and i have to unplug it from the wall for a minute or two before i can get it to power back on.  I don\u2019t know what to do. I am trying to fix this myself without having to have a repairman come out, or spend upwards of $100 on a vent cleaning, but i don\u2019t want to install the parts i bought from repairclinic yet if the vent pipe is clogged further up into the crawl space. \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions?\n\nthe Dryer is an LG DLE2050W",

The walls are, unsurprisingly, all plaster.  \n\nThe kitchen I suspect was last updated around 1960, featuring such lovely traits as horrible avocado-colored linoleum flooring (covering beautiful old original oak hardwood *why would you do that???*).  \n\nBut the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is pink mother-of-pearl tile covering 3/4 of the walls.  **It has got to go**.\n\nTo give it a nice \"country kitchen\" feel, and to avoid completely refurbishing the walls, our plan is to take down the tile and put up white beadboard where it used to be.  My question is, what is the best way to go about hanging beadboard on plaster walls?\n\nWhat I'd like to do is use furring strips, as this would save a lot of work patching the damage taking down the tile will undoubtedly cause to the plaster.  Heck, I won't even have to sand!  This is a pretty important bonus because the asbestos situation is not 100% clear (my understanding is it's possible there would be asbestos in the tile grout).\n\n**But**, I'm not sure how to put furring strips on a plaster wall. The only way I know to do it would be to put the furring strips on the wall stud, which obviously doesn't exist (or rather, they do but they're hard to find and deep behind the plaster and lath).  In our old apartment, which also had plaster walls, I couldn't even get curtain tie hooks to stay up in the plaster walls.  \n\nAny advice would be amazing!\n\n**TL;DR**:  Looking for any advice on how to put up beadboard on a plaster wall, preferably via furring strips.

    "post_text": "I bought earlier this year, a 30 year old townhome in a DC suburb. after the many rains that we've had this summer, I came home on last week to find slightly wet carpet in random areas. After moving some furniture and pulling back the carpet, I find [this](https://i.imgur.com/HVzoVES.jpg). not a good sign.\n\n I learned that I do have a sump pump located outside, in the back yard under our deck, which is connected to a GFCI outlet in the kids bathroom, 3 stories above it and at the other side of the house. That outlet constantly trips and we never bothered with it, because it only powered the master bath outlet and the bathroom fan (or so we thought). the home inspector didnt point out the sump pump so we never checked it. The underground barrel was filled with water, and the sump pump chilling in there nicely. even with power on, it didnt work until the jiggled it a little bit. My basement is not under ground, its above ground, but there is a half a story hill behind our house. im assuming water is just coming over to our place and neighbors, even though the HOA installed a drainage ditch last year behind out house. \n\nAnyways, a friend who owns a floor restoration company came by with a gun that helps him see mold/wet spots in walls and said the walls are wet and moldy 6 inches above the ground. this was confirmed when I took out the base boards. [here](https://i.imgur.com/W0mjxH7.jpg) and [here](https://i.imgur.com/YPVSUuy.jpg). [this whole left side](https://i.imgur.com/goskMKT.jpg) of the basement and the doorway walls will need to be cut 2 feet and replaced. The best part is that I found out my insurance does not cover water damage due to sump pumps failing, so i am on the hook for this one. \n\nthe main point here is though, what can I do to prevent this from happening? I check the GFCI daily now, but is there a humidity sensor that I can install behind the wall there so I can tell if it happens again? or a water level sensor that can tell me when the pump isnt working? as far as I can tell, this is the sump pump that I have, i just dont know how old it is.

    "post_text": "Hello,\nI'm hoping this is the right place. \nI live in an old stucco house (built 1910's) in Minneapolis. The foundation was redone in the 70s, the house was elevated and a basement was put in. The basement floor is poured concrete and the walls are cinder blocks. \n\nSome very cool wood paneling was put in the only room. This is not particle board. This is real finished Pine. This room went largely ignored for about 15 years until I recently decided to try to utilize the space. \nThe walls (behind the paneling) are sealed, but 15 years being left alone left the cinder blocks behind it are crumbling and moldy.\nI need to remove the paneling so that we can get rid of the mold and reseal the cinder blocks. I would like to remove it so that it can be put back afterward. The problem is I don't know how they are attached. It seems that they are all hooked together with grooves and that there are no nails. But I'm having trouble figuring out how to remove it without damaging it.\nI can provide photos if necessary.\nI hope someone can give me some advice!",

    "title": "Looking for some advice on properly creating a deck lighting canopy",
    "post_text": "Hi HomeImprovement! \n\nThis spring we'd like to spruce up the deck of our house a bit, and want to do so taking into account the age of the house. \nThe technical aspects are pretty simple, so I don't suspect that to be an issue. We're concerned more about potentially damaging the house. \n\n[First off, a picture of the deck and house](http://imgur.com/a/V6Fbrya). \n\nHeads up, I took the picture with a wide angle lens. It's not as big an area as the photo would lead you to believe. \n\nUltimately, we're looking to take the string \"bistro\" lights that are attached to the trim of the roof and suspend them on a canopy over the main area of the deck. \n\nI figured we bolt two 4x4 beams to the corners of the deck; one where the photo was taken, the other in line to the house extension that cuts into the deck. We'd string some steel cable between the two poles, and from the poles to the house (elsewhere as needed), and zig-zag the lights across it. We'd double up on the current length of the string lights to accommodate this (they're LED, 24W so we have plenty of room off a single outlet). \n\nMy concerns are primarily with the attachment to the house. I was initially planning to attach it to the roof trim, as it's wood and seems to be pretty sturdy. We've got concerns with that, though, and also the resultant height. The alternative would be to bolt it directly to the exterior wall, giving us another 4 feet or so of headroom. \n\nGiven the house is originally from 1928, what's the recommended way of attaching a hook to the exterior wall? The house was renovated, but still has the original windows and doors (awful) so I suspect much the same for the exterior walls. It'd also have to bear the weight of the light chains, which are by no means lightweight. Not sure the exact weight, but I can try and figure that out if needed. \n\nThanks!",

    "title": "Completed: fishing wire through wall and installing ethernet jack",
    "post_text": "**Preamble**: Since I asked for some advice (and got it) with previous posts here, I figured it'd only be right to share the results here as well. I'm a new homeowner and this was actually my first real improvement project, but nevertheless perhaps some of this will be useful to someone in the future here.\n\n***\n**The project and starting conditions:** My router is in one room; desktop PC in another. The router is right near an existing hole for cable line to run into the basement, so I wanted to put an ethernet line down that, run it across the (unfinished) basement ceiling and then fish it back up into the wall next to the desktop. \n\nI did have a little help in some sense, in that the previous owners had a coax line running to an outlet near the desktop. They had removed the line, but the hole in the basement ceiling and the outlet space and blue plastic outlet box were still there, so I didn't have to do any cutting drywall or drilling. \n\nHowever, the basement hole was directly above the foundation wall, and long and thin, making it difficult to get to and fish tape from. The outlet hole in the wall was filled with [a blue plastic outlet box](https://i.imgur.com/DYVJ31f.jpg) that had only a tiny hole in the back, also making it tough to fish tape from. \n\n***\n\n**How I did it**: I tried fishing the tape down through that blue box a *lot*. It just was not going to happen. People on here suggested that I needed to remove the blue box, and indeed that would have been the easiest option in terms of fishing, but that thing was insanely stuck in there, and getting it out would mean destroying it, which would mean buying tools I don't currently have.\n\nSo before trying that, I decided to try a double-fish approach. I ran my actual fish tape straight up through the basement hole, and then used a wire clothes-hanger to fashion a small hook. I was actually able to get that through the small hole in the back of [the blue box](https://i.imgur.com/DYVJ31f.jpg) and hook the real fish tape. However, the fish tape was quite rigid and has a thicker tip, so I wasn't able to get it to come through the hole. \n\nResigned to making a trip to home depot to buy some tool to carve out the back of the box, I went to take a shower. When I got out of the shower, [I found this](https://i.imgur.com/ipAiD6o.jpg). My wife had apparently decided to mess with it a little bit, and had been able to get the tape through. Magic!\n\nSo I went down to the basement, clipped one end off of my 50' Cat5e ethernet cable,  and then used electrical tape to fasten the first foot or so of the ethernet cable to the fish tape. I then had my wife upstairs guide everything smoothly through by pulling up as I released more of the fish tape until the ethernet cord was threaded up through the basement ceiling and then out the hole in the blue box. \n\nHaving solved my largest problem, I didn't want to take any chances, so I taped the ethernet cable to a desk leg upstairs and then fed the fish tape back down out of both holes and put it away. End result: [ethernet cord is where it's supposed to be on the \"destination\" end.](https://i.imgur.com/WrMcbEM.jpg)\n\nThe \"origin\" end was easier, because it's just a hole in the floor that the cable guy of the previous owners had drilled. I had already pushed a small ethernet cable through previously just to see if it would fit - you can see [the tip of it poking down into the basement here](https://i.imgur.com/tUbjkl2.jpg). \n\nAt first I tried to pull the real cable up [by taping it to that one](https://i.imgur.com/hiX5Kez.jpg), but that led to too long a rigid section, and it wouldn't work. In the end, I just pushed the cable up through the hole by hand, and while it was a bit tough to dig out on the other end (it comes out under a baseboard, sort of), [I got it out](https://i.imgur.com/QSZuQlb.jpg), and plugged it into the router. \n\nNow back to the \"destination\" end - time to get the jack ready. I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gxNZoPcnP4), and then got started. I used [the cable stripper](https://i.imgur.com/2Ki8KgL.jpg) to strip the cable, and then used the cut-off piece of casing to help [unwrap the eight wires inside, as pictured](https://i.imgur.com/xOUW5Zq.jpg).\n\nThen I matched them up with the B color pairings on the Cat5e jack and used the pushdown tool to [push down each color into its proper place](https://i.imgur.com/1qdSn7f.jpg). However, as I was following the video linked above, I was trying to get all of them more or less lined up before pushing down even one, which proved very difficult. By the time I got them all pushed down, a few of the wires seemed to be fraying further down the line from all the bending. I also then struggled and fought with the cable even more trying to snap it into the outlet cover because I'm an idiot who can't read \"up\" and \"down\", and was trying to fit it in upside down. \n\nI plugged it in to check if it worked and....[balls](https://i.imgur.com/ZR30zxU.jpg). It did connect intermittently, but I figured I'd done too much damage to the wires. I also might have spun the cable stripper a bit too far and cut into the wires a little bit there as well. \n\nSo (of course) I had to make another trip to Home Depot to get a new Cat5e jack and outlet cover. This time I bought a couple extras, but they weren't needed. I followed the same process except that I was more careful not to stress the wires, and pushed them down one by one rather than trying to line them all up at once. Then I plugged it in to test and, [blammo. Sweet, sweet internet.](https://i.imgur.com/s3hAFMh.jpg)\n\nSnapped the jack into the outlet cover, screwed that into the wall, presto. [Orange jack color to show my dominance over this stupid project that took me way too long](https://i.imgur.com/6nuRyja.jpg). (Yes, the sheetrock hole is slightly larger than the outlet cover there at the bottom, but that was the case before, previous owners must have cut it like that. Someday I'll fix it, but when standing up it's not visible so not a huge priority.)\n\nOf course, the cable in the basement still looked like [this](https://i.imgur.com/U7jBq26.jpg), so I [used some small hooks to run it along the ceiling](https://i.imgur.com/wxjw6Hp.jpg). It's kind of a temporary solution, because for now I still need the cable to have some give, since our router is currently sitting on the floor but it will eventually live on a table or something. Once the router's properly situated, I may go back and fix the cable more tightly to the ceiling, but to be honest it's probably not needed; as it is the cable's quite out of the way anyway. \n\n**TL;DR main lessons I learned from this project:**\n\n* If you can't directly fish it with fish tape, make a coat-hanger hook and hook the fish tape. \n* My wife is apparently magic\n* Be careful with cable push down or you will weaken/fray the little wires and the internet won't work. At least that was the case with the cheap cable I bought. \n* If you've got wiring like this and are taking it when you move out, leave a string or something through it so the next owner doesn't have to go through all the effort of trying to fish it 50 different ways. \n",

    "post_text": "Warning: Picture VERY Heavy Link https://imgur.com/gallery/8pzeRkM\n\nThe imgur album has LOTS of details on our process if you're interested but, I'll give the quick 'what we did' here too:\n\nThe bathroom before had lots of issues such as:\nVanity had water damage, the entire inside was destroyed\nSmattering of asbestos tiles here and there, chipped tub, rocking toilet, massively oversized medicine cabinet that was lowered, no junction boxes, lots of mix matched hooks all over the room, cracked linoleum floor. \n\nAnd that was just the stuff we could see. We would later find undersized plumbing which was floor-fed and out of code and a ceiling fan that vented into the attic instead of outside.\n\nSo, after figuring out how much the expensive things would cost (vanity, tub and flooring). We went to work demolishing everything. Removed the tub, toilet, vanity and massive medicine cabinet. \n\nWe had a flooring company install premium sheet vinyl. We went with sheet vinyl instead of tile for a couple reasons, mostly price and the neighborhood we live in. We live in a neighborhood of low to mid-range starter homes and low maintenance homes for the elderly. We could have spent the money on expensive tile but, we'd never see that money back and I gained no personal enjoyment from it, so it didn't make sense to put high end finishes on our starter home.  \n\nWe removed the one piece fiberglass tub and replaced it with a Vikrell tub from Lowes. Vanity came from Home Depot, as well as the sink. \n\nOverall, this was a pretty easy reno, the hardest part was the waiting around. Waiting for the flooring to ship, waiting for the floor to be installed, waiting for the mud to dry, waiting for my father to sand the walls, waiting for the paint to dry, etc. etc. etc. \n\nThings still to do: \n1. Install chunky shelves over the toilet for storage\n2. Get the vent back from my husband's co-worker who is cutting it to fit. With the molding in place, it was not possible to put the vent in. Instead of cutting the molding, we chose to cut the vent cover.\n\nEDITED TO ADD: \n\nThe cost of the project exactly is hard to say. I kept a spreadsheet for the things I paid for which added up to about $2,500 but, my father paid for the plumbing, drywall, and random bits of things he needed since I had no idea what I was going to the store for. It'd be safe to say this project came in under $3,000, with his purchases added in.",

And she loves springing into a run from the hallway, which means she pushes the rug out of place every single time. She sometimes just wraps herself in it, because it's so floppy, like a blanket almost. \n\nI've tried the [classic rubbery anti-slip stuff](https://www.ikea.com/ro/ro/p/stopp-folie-antiderapanta-80227877/), but it's terrible. I've also tried [this](https://www.ikea.com/ro/ro/p/stopp-filt-protectie-antiderapanta-covor-10132260/) Ikea thing that worked great for a little while but then it got all dusty so it's mostly useless now, as it's lost its grip. I've also tried double sided tape on the anti-slip stuff, and that got pulled off as well.   \nI've tried finding a small cheap rug made out of a flat weave ([like this](https://www.ikea.com/ro/ro/images/products/rindsholm-covor-tesatura-plata-bej__0722290_pe733555_s5.jpg)), since they're very resilient and stiff, but there's not a lot of options.

It's great for part of the year, but then the wasps and hornets come out and buzz around all the time despite there being no nests nearby (little bastards). Also mosquitos are a pain, but they are basically our state insect here in WI so it's just a fact of life. The balcony itself and the connecting wall are all plastic siding and flooring, and I'm thinking of cutting a \"door\" so we can open up the netting if we need to, kept closed with some sort of magnet door like those screen doors you can put in doorways (we already have one of those in the doorway to the balcony and it works great). That or clasps. I'm also not sure what would be a good way to secure it to the balcony as we're renting, but we've already been here a few years with a kid so I'm not 100% concerned with getting our entire security deposit back as that's not happening anyway. I'd definitely prefer something like command strips or something that's not a pain to remove or cause permanent damage.\n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations where I could find a cheap source of a large amount of mosquito netting to surround a balcony roughly 3ft long, 12ft wide, 7.5ft tall. I have basic sewing skills and an overabundance of time. Also any recommendations for websites I can find magnet strips or other recommended ways of making the \"door\" (just in case we need to throw something off the balcony or jump off in case of emergency), like even snaps or something? If it's not completely perfectly sealed, I don't mind. I just want to heavily discourage those stinging bastards from ruining our balcony time again.\n\nThank you!",

Plus, any time I'd drive something into sheetrock inside I'm very careful to check for wires and plumbing.    \n\nSo my most important question is how the hell do I keep safe and how do I keep the water out? I have a caulking gun, but with the siding in place I can't get to the wood. Will sealing up just at the siding be sufficient?\n\nDoes it matter if I use nails or screws? Other than stainless steel (and self-tapping if screws are the way to go), do I look for anything else in a fastener?  \n\nDoes it matter where in the siding I put the fasteners? That is, from a vertical perspective, do I want them all in the middle, near the top seam or near the bottom?\n\nHow do I keep the trellis off the wall? I could simply nail it directly to it, but don't I want some air space between it and the wall to avoid moisture build-up? Even if not for the house, the plants will need some way of winding around the thing. \n\nAny idea of what I can figure weight-wise? I'm not planning on climbing it myself, and the trellis shouldn't be all that heavy (especially if fastened in several places). But trellis plus huge rose plus a rainy day could make it fairly hefty. Is that a concern?  \n\nLastly, what if she wants the rose to make its way up onto the roof? Do all these questions/answers apply if I'm fastening things up there?\n\n\nThanks for any advice or direction. ",

    "post_text": "I posted this yesterday to DIY and they ultimately pulled the post because they said the comments in the album were not substantive enough. In case you missed it, here is my kitchen remodel. Also, below is my diary from the first month in which we got 95% of the work done. I updated it daily until about Father's Day when we began to lose steam. Enjoy! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Photos**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/LSBph4n](https://imgur.com/a/LSBph4n)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Journal**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5/19/2018 -Demo Day**\n\nI start the day by removing everything from kitchen that will ultimately have to go back in. We had removed most everything, but there were a few odds and ends. \n\nThe first cabinet I take down has a beautiful wallpaper behind it. Vestiges of the late 80's early 90's. I hope all the cabinets don't have wallpaper behind them. \n\nBegin removing one wall of cabinets and thankfully none of them have wallpaper behind them. \n\nI start on the wall cabinet and find this cool writing behind it:\n\n\tKemana Lagi Ku Haruz\n\n\tMelangkah mbokne \n\n\tAncux. Diriku seaka\n\n\tAkan tak dapat\n\n\tReerak Da Adalah\n\n\t\n\nIt translates to a indonesian dialect which means;\n\n\tWhere else should I go, motherfucker.\n\n\tIt seems like I can't move anymore\n\n\t\n\nBest I can tell, the guy who installed the cabinets was from Surabaya Indonesia and thought he was being funny. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI unscrew the rest of the wall cabinets as my wife goes to get lunch. \n\nAfter lunch, the professionals are here! My brother in law starts disconnecting the plumbing and his partner helps me remove the remaining cabinets. \n\nThere's a bunch of shitty workmanship behind the cabinets. The ceiling has plywood instead of drywall, the walls are poorly patched in places, and covered in wallpaper in others. We decide to go down to the studs on one wall. \n\nMy wife tears the drywall out there while I tear the soffit down \n\nWith the talent comes the tools. We get to work chiseling the tile out. \n\nFuck, the tile is grounded with steel mesh. It seems as though the previous owner didn't want to go through the trouble of tearing up their linoleum, but was  afraid of shifting tile, so they anchored it with this. Fuck, that was terrible to break up. \n\nBeneath that was a layer of linoleum which we tore up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 2 5/20/18**\n\nJust me today. I lay down the cement board.\n\nFirst, I cut all the pieces to size, then get to work hammering them down. \n\nIt takes 6 hours, my head is ringing from the hammering and my hand feels like it's made of wet noodles, but it's done.  \n\nThe rest of the day I spend putting our makeshift kitchen in order. \n\nWe have three rooms in the upstairs living area, the kitchen, dining room, and living room. We turn the dining room into the kitchen, the living room into the kitchen, and some chairs and stuff from the living room into the extra bedroom. \n\nWe cook rice in the rice maker, brussel sprouts in a tin foil packet in the toaster oven, and have a $5 Costco Rotisserie chicken for our first homecooked dinner. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 3 5/21/18**\n\n**Solo Bolo part duex**\n\nStart by sanding the walls down and patching any screw holes. \n\nThen drop hundreds of f-bombs as I burn my hands and almost burn my house down running a half inch water line to where the refrigerator will be for the ice maker and water dispenser. This is my first time sweating pipe and jeez do I need to practice. I was initially going to just use the needle valve I had used for the initial placement, but there's nothing else for me to do really so I might well do it right. Plus it keeps the option open of having a second faucet on that side of the room. I wish I could practice more. I am simultaneously proud of learning something new and scared it's going to break. I install and test the shutoff valve before laying any other pipe just in case. \n\nThe only other thing to do is to cut the holes for the can lights. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 4 5/22/18**\n\nMy three day weekend is (thankfully) over and I get back to work. Nothing makes me appreciate corporate IT work like construction work, however, work now seems trivial and boring. My dad comes to the house to let the garbage guy haul away the old kitchen and my bro in law and partner come in the afternoon to do electrical. Brother works on outside wall, partner works on inside wall and I run the can lights. We work til 9 only to find out the fuse is blown for the can lights so we\u2019re without light for another day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 5 5/23/18**\n\nAt lunch I go to Lowe\u2019s and buy mud plates and a new fuse.  After work I meet up with crew to finish the electrical. I install outlets while the guys finish running wires and installing the switches. Lights turn on and we call it a day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 6 5/24/18**\n\nDay off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 7 5/25/18**\n\nI clean up the debris from electrical and hang dry wall. The habitat for humanity folks pick up the old cabinets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 8 5/26/18** \n\nHelper comes and does tile for me so I'm not left with a wavy floor. He works tiling while I cut tile for him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 9 5/27/18**\n\nI finish tiling the corner pieces while wife cuts the excess thinset from the tile spaces we laid yesterday. After that, we do our first round of tape and mud. Some may say that mudding behind walls no one will ever see is a waste of time, others, a complete waste of time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 10 5/28/18**\n\nMemorial Day \u2013 No work today. We buy Laticrete Permacolor grout in dusty gray\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 11 5/29/18**\n\nDay 2 and layer 2 of mudding. The difference in thickness between the 5/8\u201ddrywall on the ceiling and 1/2\u201d drywall we bought means I\u2019ll probably end up doing a third and final coat of mud. Running low on mud so I\u2019ll probably use whatever is left on the ceiling and leave the walls which is a shame because I find myself in a flow when I\u2019m sanding the walls and applying mud. It\u2019s sort of like waxing a car, but you\u2019re waxing your walls\u2026 with mud\u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 12 5/30/18**\n\nCabinets come today. I mix up grout and start spreading it but only get half way til the bucket starts to cure. My second batch is soupier. Way too wet. I wake up 5/31 and realize I need to go over the tile a second time\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 13 5/31/18**\n\nApply a second coat of grout to floor where the soupy grout dropped too much. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 14 6/1/18**\n\nTired and sick of grouting. Go to a friend's house for dinner and enjoy spending time with them, my wife, and my baby.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 15 6/2/18**\n\nWife works the weekend so I spend the day watching baby. Clean the tiles when the baby goes down. Wife picks up grout sealer on the way home and I seal the grout\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 16 6/3/18**\n\nTo hell with protocol. This mud job looks good enough. I'm ok with 2 coats so I prime the walls to see if the changes in ceiling height will show through paint. There are a few spots that still look goofy so I mud those. I also patch the soffit drywall that I cut to run the water line. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 17 6/4/18**\n\nPaint day. Feel good about the colors my wife chose. The mud looks a lot less awesome with gray paint and I start to worry that my mudding skills aren't actually that good. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 19 6/6/18**\n\nWe pick out our granite style, get, and accept our quote from the granite installers who came in much lower than Home Depot quoted us so hell yeah.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**6/7 and 6/8 days 20 and 21.** \n\nWe start moving the cabinets from the garage into the kitchen for an easy install day\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**6/9 day 22**\n\nInstall day. It was surprisingly not hard with a helper. We start with the wall cabinets and work our way from the corners out starting with the oven wall, then the refrigerator wall. To have some much needed fun, we go to a local beer fest with friends and enjoy good company along with the usual crowd of old people who tell us how we're \"Doing it right\" by going out together with our 8 month old and how these are the best years of our lives. Thanks everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 23 6/10**\n\nI finish up the base cabinets. The wedge shaped cabinet needs a base built, so we go to home depot and get a multi tool which I had wanted for a while. It didn't help at all with the job, but now I can cut into my walls much more efficiently which will probably be necessary after everything is installed and I realize I forgot to connect one wire.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 24 6/11**\n\nI pick out the exact slab we want. It's got more red in it than I remember, but meh.  I go to Home Depot and buy our door handles. I install the door handles, screw down the over cabinet lighting, and install the undercabinet lighting using romax. I direct wire to a switch the electric guys left me\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 25 6/12** \n\nNothing today. We make an actual meal on our oven which is cool, but now it sucks double to clean given we have no food disposal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 26 6/13**\n\nThe counter installers come out to measure for the countertops. We decide that we want to add a secondary filtered drinking water faucet next to our kitchen faucet. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 27 6/14**\n\nDay off. I order the under cabinet water filter and water dispenser and plan on getting a halfway decent night of sleep finally.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 28 6/15\u000bBeginning of Father's day weeks. My \"to do\" list is as follows:**\n\n\t\u2022 Countertops\n\n\t\u2022 Kitchen sink\n\n\t\u2022 Drainage plumbing to sink\n\n\t\u2022 Top of cabinet trim\n\n\t\u2022 Cabinet toe kicks\n\n\t\u2022 Flush pieces\n\n\t\u2022 Install dishwasher\n\n\t\u2022 Install garbage disposal\n\n\t\u2022 Install Microwave\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 29 6/16**\n\nI spend the day helping my brother in law who did the electrical build a deck in his backyard\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 30 6/17**\n\nFather's Day. No work. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 31 through 39 - 6/27**\n\nTraveled to Minneapolis to visit family\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 40 - 6/28/18**\n\nGranite Counters go in!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 41 - 6/29/18**\n\nMy brother in law comes over to help install plumbing. We finally have water!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 42 - 6/30/18**\n\nMy wife starts moving in to the kitchen. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 43 - 7/1/18** \n\nThe water line to the filter water blows off the valve and spews water all over. Thankfully we don't get any water downstairs. I reseated the lines and that appears to fix it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Month of July**\n\nWe take this month off, go on Vacation, and enjoy our new kitchen for a while. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day ? - 8/4/18**\n\nMy goons come out and tile the backsplash and install trim with their nail gun while we're in Louisville.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day ? - 8/18/18** \n\nWe grout the backsplash\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**9/9/18** \n\nI install the blinds and we're done!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I ended up gluing, screwing, and nailing. Started with pine and added a bull nose using the my router table. Simple build, but not very forgiving.\n\n[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/mq2rwi/best_way_to_hang_shelves_like_this/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n\n[final product](https://imgur.com/gallery/G3WdO6l)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit with more (required) details:\n\nProducts Used:\n\n\\- Pine Boards - 1\" x 10\" x 24' ,  (3) x 8'\n\n\\- Minwax Stainable/Paintable Wood Filler\n\n\\- Caulk (White) - I think it was DAP Latex\n\n\\- Kreg Pocket Hole Jig\n\n\\- 2 1/2\" Coarse Thread Kreg Screws\n\n\\- Killz Primer\n\n\\- Valspar White interior semi gloss in \"Perfect White\"\n\nTotal Material Cost was less than $150, although I had caulk, primer, paintbrushes, sandpaper, etc. I had to buy the Valspar semi gloss, kreg screws, painters tape, wood filler, and the pine boards. \n\nProject: Process:\n\nI started by routing a bull nose edge on all of the pine using a 1/2\" roundover bit and routing both sides. Next step was to flatten a few high spots with the hand plane, sand, and put on a quick coat of primer.  After that I cut the first five shelves roughly to size and added pocket holes (kreg jig). All cuts were done on my table saw and I used an angle block to make sure my 45's were true.  I roughed in the shelves as I went, making final adjustments and making sure I could align with the studs whenever possible. The first assembly was without any plugs behind the screws and using painters tape to make sure everything was square. After the first five I went ahead and cut the remaining eight pieces (13 total).\n\nFinal install consisted of removing all the shelves from their temporary home, adding drywall plugs where I was not on studs, and then reinstalling. All of the mitered edges were glued and nailed using a finish nailer. I had a couple of blow outs that I had to snip off and fill with wood putty. I used pine kreg plugs that I thought I would be able to chisel out. That turned into a pain so I ended up using a Japanese pull saw to cut them flush. I filled any gouges with filler and sanded everything down (multiple times). Last step before beginning paint was to caulk all of the edges. The most difficult part was the coping around the trim at the bottom, but it turned out close enough that the caulk hid the line pretty well.\n\nFrom here it was one more coat of primer and two coats of semi gloss trim paint. I'll use this same trim paint on the base boards, window and door frames.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

    "post_text": "So I'm trying to hang this shelf/coat rack thing so my kids have somewhere to hang their coats. The mounting hardware on the shelf is like the recessed teardrop shape deal where the screw, nail etc...needs to extend from the wall a bit in order to engage. Right side screw found a stud ezpz right where I wanted it but where the left needs to go is several inches off. I've been a roofer and done a little framing but I know next to nothing about drywall other than how to tear it off. So anyways I went to Ace and grabbed an anchor thing. It's a long screw and like a spring loaded scissor that it screws into, I tried that and, admittedly it may be user error combined with a little rum, but i couldn't make it work, but the hole got bigger. So I went back to Ace today, as you do, and got a bigger anchor thing that's like a big cylinder with a threaded head that you screw into the drywall first and the turn in a long skinny screw that makes this Flippy bar thing flip and act as an anchor. I had to make the whole bigger to get it in and once again I'm doing something wrong and can't figure out what it is. I feel like the biggest, dumbest, idiot in the northwest. This seems like something so simple but I'm not grasping something. Can anyone help me out here?  Baseline question is as follows; What is the best way to anchor into drywall, where you can then draw out the screw 1/4-1/2 inch out of the anchor without compromising the anchors integrity? That's what I've been unable to do and what I need. Thanks to anyone in advance. Happy New Year etc...",

Mostly because we were limited by the times my FIL and our buddy could come help us.  We did everything ourselves with the exception of the flooring and paint were contracted.  We learned a lot along the way and are happy to share if anyone is interested.  The process included: removing bamboo flooring and subfloor, trimming floor joists to remove hump in floor, knocking out walls, framing new walls, removing old doorways, demoing bathroom and closet, reconfiguring plumbing for new sink, tub, and shower fixtures (drain pipes and water supply), subfloor framing, installing shower pan, tile tile and more tile, adding finishes (vanity, mirror, furniture, fixtures),  installing can lights, reconfiguring all electric (Romex wire, receptacles, lights, switches), rerouting forced air ducting, ceiling fan, barn door build, hang and finish drywall, caulk bathroom finishes, and fix paint mistakes.   I'm probably missing some steps that I'll think of later but that is the gist of it.  \n\nMajor tools that were used (buy corded tools!  batteries don't last): chop saw, circular saw, table saw, sawzall, corded right angle drill (lots of long holes for electric runs), tile saw (rented that one), tile and grout trowels and floats, various hand tools (hammers, speed square, wire cutters, tin snips etc.) 4, 6, and 7 foot levels, chalk line for framing, framing nailer and air compressor, cats paw and flat bar nail pulls, various cordless drills and battery chargers, propane torch, Bosch hammer, and many more I can't think of\n\nTotal cost: not sure, upwards of $15K at least.  Hard to keep track over 3 years...lots of Expendables, nails, screws, glue, plumbing parts and glue, lumber, drywall, tile backer board, tile mud, drywall mud, primer, Romex wire, receptacles, switches, can lights and trims, new and replacement hand tools, concrete.  Contracted tile and hardwood floor around $6K, paint around $1500.  All in all it was not majorly expensive when spread out over 3 years\n\nLessons learned: \ncoordinate your garbage pickup schedule with demo activities so you don't have to do extra pickups.  Our neighborhood does a bulk pickup once a month so we always put out bundles of crap that week to help clear out the excess (mostly old 2x4s)\n\nSeal tiles before (and after) install.  Much easier to clean glue and grout off that way.  Measure every single tile cut before making them.  Layout your entire tile project before doing any cutting.  Think about where you want the cut tiles to be so that you don't have an ugly line of cut tiles (1/4\" difference from left to right on a row of 8x16 tile is much less noticable than 1/4\" difference on a row of small tiles that were cut to fit) also in the shower consider using something like a bullnose or \"chair rail\" type piece to create a transition between the floor pan and the walls.  Remember: your walls and floors are not plumb, level, and square.  They just aren't.  So really think about how to configure your tiles to make them best appear to be square plumb and level.\n\nAlways add backing in between framing studs in areas where you might consider hanging things in the future (towel bars, shower bench seat etc.).  It costs very little extra time and money and will make it easier to add features later if you ever want to change things.  Running a full 2x12 header across the bathroom entry wall made adding the barn door a breeze\n\nMake sure you are explicit with every detail of what you want a contractor to do! Get it written in the quote upfront.  We had a reputable brand of painter come out.  The estimator agreed to include finishing touches on drywall (corners, feathering seams etc.). We did a good job prepping the walls, but an expert drywall finisher's touch (which I do not possess) will always make the paint job look shit hot.  So we figured the language included in the quote meant that the painter would be providing that work.  False.  They painted right over the lumps, bumps, and scratches that we had missed without even so much as a quick scrape of the walls beforehand.  Definitely not worth 1600$.  Definitely will never use that paint company again.  Lesson learned: be explicit with your estimator and cover every detail upfront.\n\nIf you're combining DIY with contractor work, make sure the contractor is willing to accept the risk associated with building upon your work.  Case and point: the floor company refused to tile the shower and tub surround because they had never used the waterproof pan we installed in the shower and couldn't guarantee it was waterproof (something the manufacturer does and we had paperwork to show it).  Lesson learned: we saved almost $7K on labor for that job and learned a lot about the intimate workings of a tile saw \n\nThat about wraps it up.  Any questions please ask! \n\nThe remaining items: Window to be installed in the bathroom in the spring, closet built-ins to be installed (contractor) asap.  Small furniture details to be added\n",

    "post_text": "A while back we decided we wanted to mount our TV to our wall and hide any wires that would be hanging down. We did some research on how to add a second outlet up high to be behind the TV and felt confident we could do it. The second outlet works fine, and all the wiring work was done without a hitch. The issue came with me saw skills when cutting the nails of the old gang box (not sure if this is the correct term for the blue boxes where the wiring lives in the wall). I used a saw to cut the nails, but when breaking through the nails the saw jumped and cut too far. Now the tabs on the new work box don\u2019t properly secure which means anything that you try to plug into the outlet on that box moves and is flimsy. \n\nIs there a way to fix this, or am I going to have to repair the entire area with new drywall? I really want to be able to avoid doing that if at all possible. We don\u2019t have an immediate need for the outlet and I know the wiring is secure in the box and not a danger so we just avoid using the outlet, but I don\u2019t like the idea of having an outlet that we can\u2019t use because I botched my first go at mounting a tv to hide wires. \n\nHere is a picture of the issues. In the first you can see the messed up hole around the box, and in the second you can see how the plate is uneven against the wall. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/uHDK6m4\n\nTL/DR: Cut nails of old gang box to remove it and add a new work box. Did not handle the saw properly and now new work box is not secured properly and has significant wiggle when trying to use the outlet. \n\n",

    "post_text": "Generally ranked by how much of a pain in the ass they were...\n\n * Gutter Guards - This was the biggest pain, but totally worthwhile.  For some reason in June I hosed out the gutters and after that decided it was the perfect time to install gutter guards.  Pretty much all of our leaves have dropped and our gutters still look as clean as the day I hosed them out.  I've just went up with a broom and cleared leaves out of the corners where rain diverter things are.  Best part...the absolute cheapest ones work for a majority of our house so we didn't break the bank putting them up.  Last fall/winter, our first in this house, the gutters filled up 6-7 times with leaves.\n\n * Sprinklers - So many attempts to fix sprinkler problems without replacing the whole valve box because there is virtually no room left for fixes.  They're working now, though our November water bill was really high so I am concerned about a leak somewhere in the house.\n\n * Range Hood (vented) - After a friend helped me cut a hole in the house for a new exterior outlet, I felt up to cutting a hole in the roof.  It took a lot of planning and about 12 hours with minimal help from my wife -- it was mostly a one person job -- and we are pretty happy with the end result.  I should crawl back up into the attic to check for signs of leakage again, but I am fairly confident in it.  \n\n * Ceiling Repair - Did a crappy job of fixing the ceiling after I shifted my weight back on my heels (twice) and pushed some of the ceiling down in the kitchen while working on the range hood vent.\n\n * Damn Tub Spout - \"Fortunately it's one of the easiest of plumbing chores,\" [according to Home Depot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlrEDWUacLg).  Unless the pipe unscrews from inside the wall.  All reasonable people I talked to said I should cut out the wall behind it to make sure it wasn't leaking once I fixed that, but I just put plumber's tape on it and screwed it back into the wall.  We don't use that shower much anyway...\n\n * Fence Posts - This may not qualify, but three fence posts have rotted out this year.  The neighbor I share a fence with for the first two helped pay for and replace the first couple, but my wife and I did it all for fence we share with a widow.\n\n * Elongated Toilet - After seeing in May the $100 water rebate was renewed for my city this year, I got a high efficiency toilet and it has been wonderful.  It may have clogged once but is so much better than the last one, especially since there was previously a round bowl in the guest bathroom.\n\n * Tool Storage - The neighbor inspired me to make a storage solution and I had some wood leftover from a 2014 project so saw a [picture like this](http://hostedmedia.reimanpub.com/TFH/Step-By-Step/FH09SEP_NEAGAR_03.JPG) and designed my own wooden racks with spacing for the tools I planned to hang on the wall.\n\nThat's all I can remember, but I bet if I searched my posts in /r/homeimprovement I could find another one or two...\n\nEdit:  Gutter guards should have been easy to install, but it seems our gutters are an inch narrower than usual, so I had to cut a bunch of triangles out to fit around nails in the shingles.  We have a sprawling ranch style house so there are more gutters than the average house =\\",

    "post_text": "TL;DR at the end. \n\nWe had our roof replaced at the end of June 2019. \n\nInitially, we were extremely pleased with the roofing company we chose to complete the work. Sales Rep from Roofing Company was very communicative, returned our phone calls and emails within the day, was able to answer our questions, and went as far as to get us in their schedule ASAP. Sales Rep even came out to meet with our insurance adjuster to help us with the insurance process. Worth noting: our insurance didn\u2019t cover the new roof so it\u2019s an out of pocket expense.\n\nPrior to the work we had discussed with Sales Rep our ideas and what we wanted. One specific example of this was having the crew remove two vents, one being an old power vent, then installing a ridge vent.\n\nFast forward a month or so. The crew wrapped up after two full days. Half way through day two, after the decking was laid and shingle were placed, we contacted Sales Rep because the crew left the vents we discussed having removed. Not a big deal. Sales Rep told the crew and they removed them. Also, at the end of day two, our house started smelling of a strong chemical and wood odor. We figured it was just the new materials... \n\nThe following day, day three, my husband and I did our own walk around inspection. We got in the attic and noticed that the decking wasn\u2019t cut back to allow air to vent, through our new ridge vent. That\u2019s why we were getting the odor in the house.  We also noticed the crew didn\u2019t fill in the holes from the two vents we asked that they remove. They just covered the holes with paper and shingles. Unacceptable. Also, The electrical supply to the power vent that was removed is still hanging in the attic. It looks as though they just ripped it out. We weren\u2019t asked to cut the power at anytime so we\u2019re unsure if it\u2019s live or not. \n(Side note: Since then we\u2019ve been having an electrical issue in the ceiling fan of our bedroom. It turns off and on at random times of the day.)\nWe then climbed up on the roof. There  were multiple colors of gloppy caulk in numerous, random places. We had blobs of caulk in the middle of shingles as if they crew missed with the nail gun and just covered it up. The wrap around our fireplace was replaced and looked like a five year old finger painted the sealant. Very, very sloppy work. \nThe ridge was covered with two different shapes of shingles. \nWe contacted Sales Rep and they were we\u2019re out to fix these issues within the week. So we thought. Their idea of fixing the issues is subpar at best. \n\nThe following week we had an incredibly heavy storm pass through that lasted maybe thirty minutes. That was enough rain and wind for us to realize we now have a leak. That\u2019s also when communication with Sales Rep did a complete 180.  We haven\u2019t had any luck, since the middle of July, to get someone out to further fix anything. Our emails and phone calls go days/weeks without a reply. \n\nWe\u2019ve gone as far as having another, more reputable, roofing company come out and give us an estimate for repairs. After going over the roof with more professional eyes, we have more problems than what I stated above. Our ridge vent went from not being open at all to being cut too wide. Now the actual vent is flexing and dipping so there are areas for water to sit and potentially leak. We have ridge that was cut out but just shingled over causing another area for water to pool and potentially leak. We have uneven decking on another section of ridge with shingles that are laid in reverse so water can potentially run down underneath and leak. The two vent holes I mentioned earlier were sloppily patched with a piece of plywood. We now have a brand new roof that\u2019s patched. Not happy about that. \n\nMy husband has gone as far as to contact the owner of Roofing Company. He informed Company Owner of the problems, and the lack of communication. Company Owner said he wasn\u2019t even aware of the issues. My husband expressed that we\u2019re not happy, this roofing experience was awful, and we don\u2019t want to schedule the repairs with Roofing Company. My husband also asked about finalizing the bill which  includes deducting what it would cost for having the other roofing company fix our issues. \n\nThat was three, almost four, weeks since my husband spoke with Company Owner on the phone. My husband has emailed a few different times and still hasn\u2019t gotten a response. \n\nIn total, it\u2019s been two and a half months since the work was completed, and we haven\u2019t paid yet. We were told \u201cyou don\u2019t pay until you\u2019re satisfied.\u201d We were initially hounding them to satisfy the work so we can pay the bill but, they don\u2019t seem interested or willing to finalize anything.   \n\nWe\u2019re at a loss... Any ideas as to what other avenues we can legally take to finalize with Roofing Company? \n\nOur request was to finalize was to deduct 3k from the bill.\u00a0 This would allow us to use $2800 to have the other company fix the open issues and an extra $200 to put towards fixes on an electrical issue that started after they replaced our roof. \n\nTL;DR Got a new roof at the end of June 2019. We\u2019re not happy, and have a leak. We\u2019ve had zero luck, after two and half months of numerous attempts, to get someone out to fix our issues. Now we want a different, more reputable, company out to do the repairs. We also want take the cost of those repairs off the original Roofing Company final bill.",

    "post_text": "Hi All,\n\nI thought I would provide an update to my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/rud8qp/advice_hanging_6_antique_art_with_no_canvas/) and add in the correct terminology if anyone else searches for advise on this issue. \n\nI was looking to hang an art piece with no screen in my home that could NOT be framed. At the time I didn't know the name for this kind of art: Japanese Folding Screen (or Byobu).\n\nIf you happen to purchase, inherit, or sidewalk score one of these gorgeous pieces - you have a couple options:\n\n1. Buy the metal wall brackets like [these](https://www.amazon.com/Tulead-Stainless-Bracket-Display-Brackets/dp/B07SX6SM12/ref=sr_1_7?crid=2CPAYWJEF1591&amp;keywords=byobu+hanger&amp;qid=1647526718&amp;sprefix=byo%2Caps%2C648&amp;sr=8-7), or [these](https://www.amazon.com/Oriental-Furniture-Silk-Screen-Brackets/dp/B000O8C7H2/ref=sr_1_5?crid=2CPAYWJEF1591&amp;keywords=byobu+hanger&amp;qid=1647526762&amp;sprefix=byo%2Caps%2C648&amp;sr=8-5). Pros being that they're sturdy, cons being you'll probably need to add anchors to your screws and measure everything perfectly with little to no room for error.\n2. Head over to [artfitters.com](https://artfitters.com) and buy [their version of the hangers](https://artfitters.co/products/4-panel-screen-hanger-kit) using angled nailing. Pros being: you only need the bottom row to be perfectly straight and then you can nail everything else later with no extra steps - there's enough points of contact it can hang without anchors. Cons are they're a bit more expensive.\n3. Go to a local metal shop and have pieces custom made. Pros being you can have them made to your exact specifications. Cons being you probably have to leave your house lol. Unsure what the pricing details would be like for this option.\n\n[Here's my beautiful boy](https://imgur.com/a/auSXgVX) for anyone interested.\n\nI hope this helps. Happy byobu hanging!",

    "post_text": "Hey, all! Recently moved into our first house, and have quickly discovered that we are the neighborhood's pigeon haven. Our roof is sort of like the normal \"gable\" shaped roofs, except that the tops of the two sides do not connect but rather drop down to a sort of flat landing as the connection. Like this...    /l\\_l\\\\\n\nThere are plenty of other houses in the neighborhood with this design, but almost none except ours where the air condition is conveniently placed on that flat landing area between. Great for aesthetically hiding the AC I guess, but this creates an excellent pigeon escape from the sun/heat (I'm in Arizona) + space for nests. I can honestly live with them crapping all over the roof, but I'm worried about the potential damage to the AC or vents.\n\nWithout further ado,  [The Pigeon Zone created by AC/Roof combo](https://imgur.com/iDRSuoV)\n(note that those metal pieces were already up there when I bought the place, probably when the previous owner reached this same point of trying whatever came to mind)\n\nI originally put a bunch of spikes in, but they just found ways to (1) squeeze under the AC itself and make homes underneath; (2) literally crap on top of + throw twigs/materials on top of the spikes until they could just land right on it and make nests. I'm telling you, they're evil geniuses.\n\nMy current plans, based on interweb suggestions:\n\n* block underneath the unit (would love recommendations on what materials to use, but I'm thinking some blocks of wood can both take up the space and not be hazardous to be lodged underneath)  \n\n* put some nails in the wood beams and zig zag strong fishing line across the roof. Partially to make it difficult to land on/enter this section of the roof, partially because I've read pigeons are both clumsy + have good eye sight and will avoid the fishing line.\n   * If you look closely, you can see in the picture that I had already started doing this + have now added much more. It's like Mission Impossible for any AC repair I might have to do in the future\n\nSo yeah, **any feedback on these plans OR inevitably better ideas, PLEASE send them my way**\n\n\nPS...other things that don't seem to help at all:\n\n* those \"scarecrow\" owls (maybe for like a day/until the pigeons either realized that it is fake or that they vastly outnumber it)  \n\n* those shiny reflective windchime things you hang up (they literally pulled them down and made built them into the nests just to mock me)  \n\n* putting strong spices around the area. I feel stupid just writing it.",

    "post_text": "I'm replacing all the shelving and towel racks/hooks in my bathroom. I'm planning to install a shelf above the door. But when i went to try to locate the studs tonight... i couldn't.  I literally couldn't find a single stud with my magnetic stud finder.  I couldn't even find and nails/screws near the trim where the header should be.  I tried to locate the king studs, but the stud finder didn't hit in anything along the vertical trim or anywhere above the door.  The wall sounds hollow too.\n\nThe odd thing is, my house was rehabbed in 2006 and reframed with steel framing.  So on the other walls the magnet stud finder goes nuts when i hit a stud.  It's plain as day.  Now i don't know for sure that this entire wall with the door is steel framing, but IIRC the switch box right next to the door is attached to a steel stud.\n\nIs it even possible to build a wall with a door without framing it out? Or is it possible that there are studs, but they're not screwed to the drywall for some reason?  I am not planning to hang anything super heavy (just storing TP actually lol).  But if that is just one big piece of sheet rock with no studs, i don't think any wall anchor is going to cut it.",

    "title": "Finding beams in a DIY addition ?",
    "post_text": "Okay so, Im a 26 y/o female with zero real experience in any of this. But I am on a mission to find beams in my ceiling to hang hooks for a hanging chair. Basically I bought this house two years ago and it's clear someone closed in the back porch and made it into an addition, which is now a Florida room. (Lots of Windows, a sun room maybe?)  There's a fan / light fixture in the center of the ceiling. To start, I read online you can find beams or joists by starting from a wall and inserting a nail  16 or 24 inches in. I tried this, and there was nothing. I tried in various places, from each wall, thinking maybe the beams were for some reason going long ways (from wall to wall which is probably 20 feet) instead of short ways (from the back wall to the windows, probably ten feet,). There is nothing 16 or 24 inches away from either wall in any spot. There is now, however, a ton of tiny holes in my ceiling. LOL.  Anyway I decided the fan must be on some type of support beam right? Right! So I tried a nail in line with where the fan is installed and sure enough there's a beam. I tried going 16, then 24 inches in both directions from the spot I found. Nothing. I started poking around randomly and long story short there's 3 beams, each 32 inches apart. They go from the back wall to the windows (ten feet). Then, I hit another snag when moving the other way from the fan, there seems to be a beam missing. There's a beam, and then 64 inches from that is the next one. For the life of me I can't find one between these two. What in the world can possibly be happening? Also, Why would anyone make ceiling joists 32 inches apart? Or am I missing something major? \nI have tried a stud finder. No luck, popcorn ceilings don't help. I've tried tapping but after doing it 3000 times it all sounds the same. I'm losing my mind lol. \nFor the record, I'm not just gonna screw something in my ceiling without being 100% certain it's right, so no worries there. \nAlso, once I tried a bigger nail (about 1.5in long), it seems like maybe what's stopping the nail isn't actually permeable at all. (Would they put a cement beam up there???)  I should also include that when I bought the house I quickly realized they did a \"fast and easy\" job at making it look nice instead of using durable / long lasting paint / supplies. So I'm hesitant to think they would put any amount of money into worrying if the ceiling they threw up was sturdy. \n\nSigh. SOS. I don't want to spend 1-4 k for someone to come tell me where a beam is lol. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/Qk5U3GX\n\nThe left side by the plants has the beams. The right side towards the wall is where I can't find them.  \nTia \n\nTLDR: can't find ceiling beams; why would they be 32 inches  apart ?",

    "post_text": "Sorry if this has been addressed already but I have been looking around for answers and I haven't found anything that fits my situation. I have replaced the old cast iron plumbing in my house with PEX-A plumbing, and now I am just missing the outdoor spigots. I have been putting it off because I am not entirely sure how to install it properly given what I am working with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy house is from the 1970's and is a brick home. the roof is a low slope so there isn't much space to move around in the attic, and getting to the exterior walls in the attic is very difficult. I would have to crawl on my stomach and have my hand outstretched to get there. Also there is no crawl space, the house sits on a concrete slab foundation. The walls consist of the brick, followed by a 1x2, followed by drywall. So there is only about 0.75\" of space between the brick and drywall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have two thoughts on adding the outdoor spigots (with a rough sketch here [https://imgur.com/gallery/CghZ2LJ](https://imgur.com/gallery/CghZ2LJ)):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Somehow snaking the 0.5\" inner diameter pex pipe in between the brick and drywall, adding a 90 degree elbow, drilling a hole into the brick, extending pex pipe to the outside, then installing a pex-a friendly spigot to the pipe and securing it to the brick.\n2. drilling a hole in the soffit, lowering the pex pipe down and securing it on the brick wall from the outside, covering exposed pipe with something, installing a 90 degree elbow at the end of pipe somehow (maybe with a drop ear elbow?) and adding the spigot.\n\nPros and Cons of 1st option: This seems like the right way to do it since PEX won't be potentially exposed to UV, and the spigot will be flush with exterior wall. This way seems difficult since there is only 0.75\" of space in between the brick and the drywall to work with. The elbow in the wall may not fit without me breaking a little of the brick. Also, having the pipe in the wall may could lead to it getting penetrated by a nail or screw in the future if someone is trying to hang something at that exact location.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPros and Cons of 2nd option: This seems easier to do for my. I can create a hole in the soffit from the outside and push pex pipe from the outside into the attic, so I don't have to crawl on my stomach to reach that location in the attic. Also, this would avoid anyone accidentally drilling a screw into it since it will be outside. But this will be outside it has the potential to be exposed to UV (even though it would be completely covered, and I am not exactly sure how to attach a spigot using this method.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions or opinions please feel free to tell me, I have been thinking about this for a while and have been putting it off for too long.",

    "title": "Strengthening Porch Ceiling Joists for Swing",
    "post_text": "I want to hang a swing from front porch ceiling joists. (Central Virginia)\n\nThe ceiling is made up of 4\" tongue-and-groove wood panels attached to the underside of the joists. I recently created an access hatch to the area above the ceiling (meant to do this for years!) so now have access to the joists and rafters.\n\nMy initial plan was to install blocking  (4x4?) between two joists flush up against the ceiling panels (but attached to the joists of course). Then mount the two brackets for the swing using through-bolts through the blocking.\n\nThe joists are 2x8 face-mounted to the ledger boards (right name?), 16\" apart. The joists span about 9 feet and are toe nailed to the ledger boards but the connections don't look terribly solid - some air gaps between the boards. See image: [https://imgur.com/a/mELBPHE](https://imgur.com/a/mELBPHE).\n\nI'm thinking I should strengthen the joists first before trying to mount blocking or the swing brackets, the question is how. (Replacing the joists or taking down the ceiling panels is a no-go.) Several sites have mentioned sistering, but I don't understand how the sister boards would connect into the ledger boards when mounted flush to the existing joists. I would add metal hanger straps to the joists but can't do that without taking down the paneling.\n\nIs there a type of strap I can add to existing joists to tie into the ledger boards without needing to go underneath?\n\nMaybe I should add a couple of additional 2x8 joists with hangers between existing joists?\n\nOr add one solid 4x4 (4x8??) joist beam to hang from and not deal with using the existing 2x8s?\n\nThanks for any advice.",

    "title": "Playroom with Playset Project",
    "post_text": "Edit: editor cut off most of my post after I fixed the links. More explanation coming.\n\nTL/DR: I took a huge storage room and transformed it into a playroom with a built-in playset for my ~~sanity~~ kids.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Pictures from start to finish](https://imgur.com/a/aaiBCVP)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith the kids home most of the day (thank goodness for in-person preschool), my wife an I were being driven crazy by the kids in the main living room. They were pent-up rambunctious loud normal kids who left their toys everywhere (5 years old, 3 years old, 18 months). So my wife and I decided to reduce our clutter by getting rid of some things and moving others from our huge storage room into a playroom. Unfortunately, my wife went to Pinterest for some ideas. Thus an empty room with their toys became a project.\n\n\nFirst I measured and made a couple of different models of playset to put in the room. the one in the pictures is the one we settled on. I used Microsoft's 3D builder program. As I didn't need anything too fancy or that cost money.\n\n\nThen we started emptying the storage room, some was sold online, some was given to charities, some was taken to the dump, and we kept a few things.\n\nWe took some time deciding what to do with the walls. Since I had never mudded or taped we were not confident in my abilities. We also wanted something stronger than drywall because well kids. After discussing manget boards or other options we decided on bead board as I had done that before. Unfortunately, this time was vastly different and not in a good way.\n\nThen it was on to mudding and tapping which I had never done before. It turned out better than I expected. Some of my seams were very well done. Others needed some help. It didn't matter if it was the first, middle, or last any of them could have been good or bad.\n\nAt this point I was waiting for some supplies to come in (mostly wood). So decided to go on to paint. Boss lady decided that we needed to use sky blue. Since most of the paint was going to be on the ceiling I choose Matte paint. I also knew that it would hide my imperfections better. Since the bead board was going 8 feet tall on all walls but one I didn't have to worry about durability. I used my brothers paint sprayer the original primer I used worked great. Then I switched to a slightly different primer but it was thicker and cause some minor issues until I thinned it out. I never want to do primer without a sprayer again it was so much easier. However, they say to roll on color. I also wanted a little texture to help hide the imperfections. So I rolled the blue on.\n\nAfter the paint dried and I was able to get my supplies it was time to get down to the real building. I started with putting in the baseboards making sure they were level. Note if I was to use these kinds of baseboards again I would put the bead board up first. The issue was when I went to put the bead board up it was not perfectly square so I had issues getting it to stay butted agains the board next to it and the baseboard.\n\nThis was the time when my worst failure of this project happened. I used Liquid Nails with a couple of brad nails from my pneumatic nail gun to put the bead board up. Liquid Nails is what I used last time I did bead board but that wasn't 8 feet tall and more importantly I have since learned that Liquid Nails changed the formula to be VOC compliant. This resulted in 1/3 the holding strength it had before. Finally to top it all off I didn't check the length of the brad nails and they were only 1 inch long so they didn't go far enough to hid studs. Needless to say the whole thing came crashing down. My solution that only partially worked was to use 2 tubes of Liquid Nails a ton of brad nails all over and use a board and chair to hold it up for about an hour. This is when I did my research on Liquid Nails. The next morning when I got up one side of the panel was looking great the other side had a wave in it and I couldn't fix it. Oh well, have to move on or this will never get done.\n\nAfter that I took all the tubes of Liquid Nails back and got Loctite instead. It worked a lot better still had to hold it for several minutes to let it start to cure but better than an hour. My brother-in-law and father-in-law came to help. We finished the bead board and the chair rail. Then we started working on the framing for the playset. I had already put the leger board up before the bead board so we worked on hanging the vertical supports from the ceiling anchor which I had already hung. This is where I got to start using my very overkill, for this project, brackets. Hey if your going to build it for kids might as well over build it.\n\nThe framing was the most enjoyable part of this entire project in fact it went so smoothly that my father-in-law and I both kept double checking things because it was going too easily. However after drilling holes with the hammer drill and setting the brackets for the posts we hung the joists and every turned out square. Unlike the rest of the room.\n\nWe then installed the platforms using the plywood I already had. It was a pain to get straight cuts out of the circular saw. I saw guide bent near the beginning so we had chalk lines and free handed it. In retrospect we should have just taken the time to pack up my father-in-law's table saw and bring it over. Rip cuts are a 100% easier on a table saw.\n\nI was back on my own to put together the shelves, ladder, and slide. I didnt put the slide together at this point as I wanted to use my electric sander as I was planning on several coats for the slide. So on to sanding everything. I went though a lot of sandpaper. I got the platform, ladder, shelves, and slide super smooth with 320 grit. everything else stopped at 220.\n\nBack to painting. So I put up painter's plastic with painter's tape to protect the few things in the room I didnt want to be white. Out came the paint sprayer, but this time I ran out of primer and the store didn't have the one I originally used. When I asked they said they had some in quart sized. So I got that and left, thinking that the different color was due to the different size. Oh, how wrong I was. The primer I was originally using and the second primer I used were both water based as I was planning on using latex paint. This primer was oil based. It was not low fumes, I got a little tippsy and had a headache for the next couple of days. I had to rough up that primer with sandpaper so I could apply water based primer. What a waste of several days.\n\nFinally on to the white paint. I thought about rolling it like I did the blue but all the corners and nooks and cranies were just to much for me so I sprayed the paint on as well. I did two coats of primer, two coats of paint. Then for the platform, shelves, ladder and slide I added two coats of Minwax polycrylic water based protective finish. Sanding in between for a very smooth surface. Mostly to make the most touched areas last longer but also to make the slide really fast.\n\nI could see the light at the end of the tunnel. I started putting in the flooring. I had to cut around the posts and the sides but it turned out great and I'm glad most of the room is white or those colors would have been very busy looking. I also got my custom made nets in. I used a ridiculous amount of staples to attach it to the frame. See previous comment about over engineering things.\n\nThen I moved in the Lovesac and some toys. I had still not put the slide together becuase I started but stupidly used the same 1 1/2 screws I used for the brackets on the frame. Works great with 2x6s not so great with 3/4 thick plywood. I had to repair, sand, repaint, and refinish that part of the slide.\n\nLuckily it only took a day. I then installed the slide using the variable angle brackets, but the wall next to the slide is not square with the wall behind the playset that the platform is square with. The slide ended up being slightly crooked with the bottom moved over toward the ladder side. This left a gap at the connection of the slide and platform. I have not figure out how to fix that yet. If anyone has any ideas please let me know.\n\nAt some point the TV went up, the chairs came in and the rest of the toys made it on the shelves.\n\nHaving this separate area for the kids to play and keep all of their toys had made my wife's and my lives infinitly better. I could feel the weight off my shoulders. \n\nIn case you are wondering the one area of the platform that doesn't have a net is for jumping out onto the Lovesac.\n\nLessons learned. \n* Use a table saw not a circular saw for rip cuts and crosscuts to big for the miter saw.\n* Put the bead board up first then put the molding over it. \n* Double check what base the paint or primer you are use is. Make sure they all match. Oil with Oil, Water with Water.\n* Never use Liquid Nails again. Since they changed the fomula to be VOC compliant it has 1/3 the holding power it used to.\n\nMaterial List:\n* Plywood: was already here but something like [THIS](https://www.lowes.com/pd/3-4-in-Common-Fir-Sanded-Plywood-Application-as-2-x-4/1000068963)\n* Corner Trim: [HERE](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Simpson-Strong-Tie-Strong-Drive-174-SD-CONNECTOR-Screw-8212-9-x-1-1-2-in-1-4-Hex-Drive-Mech-Galv-100-Qty/3242494)\n* Long 2x6: Used for the ceiling anchor and front of frame.

    "title": "Crawlspace Vapor Barrier/Insulation Questions",
    "post_text": "I've decided to install a vapor barrier+rigid foam insulation in my crawlspace because I'm getting tired of the insanely high levels of humidity in my house.  It's causing mold to appear where mold shouldn't be, and there appears to be some mild rot in at least one section of the floor which is causing slight sagging.  (I know I'll need to replace the floor eventually, but that's down the road.  Reducing the humidity is my prime concern.)\n\nHere's a map of my crawlspace: http://i.imgur.com/nc5Dc4f.png\n\nBackground:\n\n- I'm in Ohio.\n- I live in a low-lying forest in what used to be called the Great Black Swamp.  I have standing water within 50 feet of the house frequently.  It's wet a LOT.\n- I don't get standing water in the crawl, but it's frequently muddy.\n- The thick lines on the map are me-sized holes in the crawlspace.  About 16x24\".\n- I only notated the vents that are of interest to me.  There are 5 or 6 more vents around the entire perimeter, but those will be blocked with rigid foam+caulk during this process.\n- The squares on the map are support pillars built from block.  Most pillars are 16x16\", but some are 8x16\".\n- I'm unsure of the pillar situation in the top left section (the sunroom) because there's no easy access and it's only about 12\" deep.\n- The sunroom was built on a concrete slab, so I don't *think* I need to get a vapor barrier in there, but correct me if I'm wrong.  If I do need a vapor barrier, this will need to be done at a later date.\n- The sunroom has no heating ducts in it, but it does have a wall-mounted propane heater in the top left corner.  We usually keep it off because we don't hang out in the sunroom often.\n\nCurrent Plan:\n\n- Install vapor barrier along floors and 6-12\" up the walls of the main crawlspace\n- Install vapor barrier around pillars in main crawlspace\n- Install rigid foam along foundation walls\n- Install longer downspouts\n- Seal up any leaks in HVAC system\n- Shore up the saggy floor\n- After everything's sufficiently dry, remove any mold still hanging around\n\nFuture Plan:\n\n- Seal the access hatch more tightly to limit humid air intake\n- Replace any missing insulation on ductwork\n- Whole house dehumidifier if necessary\n\nQuestions:\n\n**Do I *need* rigid foam along my interior crawlspace walls or only on the perimeter walls?**\n\nI'm planning on covering the interior walls, but I want to confirm this is necessary before actually doing it.  The less time I have to spend in the crawl, the happier I'll be.\n\n**How do I best attach my vapor barrier to the foundation/pillars?  Some options I've seen:** \n\n- Mastic\n- Polyurethane caulk\n- Acoustic sealant caulk\n- Something else?\n\nThe barrier edges along the foundation will only need to hold until I get the rigid foam up.  I'd like the pillar edges to be permanent without mechanical intervention, but I'll put up furring strips if necessary.  The less I have to use a nail gun, the happier I'll be.\n\n**When installing the rigid foam, should I:**\n\n1. leave the top 3\" of the foundation and the sill plates uncovered.\n2. cover the top of the foundation and the sill plate with a single layer of foam.\n3. cover the foundation completely and fill the entire sill plate area with chunks of foam? \n\nI'm planning on doing #2. It seems like #1 is for houses in the Southeast, and #3 is very uncommon.\n\n**The sunroom (top left area) has an extremely cold floor in the winter.  A small closet in this room is extremely humid year-round and actually started collecting dew on one of the walls this winter.  Since this closet is collecting moisture, I can only assume the crawlspace is also collecting moisture. I'd like to dry out this area ASAP with a solution that will keep it dry and warm (hopefully.)  I will block up the exterior vent to prevent moist outside air from coming in, but I'm confused about what to do with the inside vent.  Should I:**\n\n 1. leave the interior vent open so conditioned air can move from the main space to the sunroom crawlspace passively.\n 2. install a fan in the interior vent to move air from the main crawlspace into the sunroom crawlspace.\n 3. install a fan in the interior vent to move air from the sunroom crawlspace into the main crawlspace.\n 4. Option #2, but with passive vent(s) in the sunroom floor.\n 5. Option #3, but with passive vent(s) in the sunroom floor.\n\nI like Option #5 the best, but I'm also HVAC dumb.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read through my wall of questions.  I'm more than willing to provide additional info or reword things if it's not clear.  I've got to get this done ASAP because I've got a baby on the way and babies hate mold.",

They came when I tried to hang a painting on the wall, the plaster was really brittle and it took the third time to get the nail to hold. I've since removed the painting and now need to patch the damage to the walls. I'm not all that familiar with patching plaster walls and am wondering if this is a repair I can do. The plaster has a bit of a sandy texture like there are large grains within it. Is it possible for me to patch this wall and match the texture, further is it possible to match the color? The walls aren't painted but I don't know if the color will still be impossible to match without redoing the entire surface. \n\nWhat exactly would this kind of repair entail and is it something I can do myself or do I need to call a professional?

    "title": "Supplying power to outdoor string lights",
    "post_text": "Recently moved into a new house and finally hung my string lights up over my patio area. The house I was in previously (renting) had a large deck, and I just hung these around the perimeter of the deck railing and ran outdoor extension cords over the sliding door and along the bottom of the deck and they basically stayed outside year round for the last 3 years. I just plugged them in at night and unplugged them before I went to sleep. \n\nIn my new house I actually have them as they\u2019re typically used, off the ground over top of the patio. I also ended up getting an outdoor WiFi outlet so I can just turn them on and off using my phone. Wanted to see if anyone could recommend the best way to supply power to these.\n\nThe lights are around 8 feet off the ground and to get them even over the patio, the plug at the start of the lights is about 2.5 ft away from the house. I have an outdoor outlet, and the first thing that I know that I need to do is replace the cover with an \u201cin use\u201d cover that I\u2019m going to pick up today. The outlet is at ground level and I need to get power to the lights 8ft up. In the picture you can see I temporarily have an extension cord plugged in just to make sure they were working after I got them all set up, but I obviously don\u2019t want a cord hanging there.\nI think the two main options are 1) install an outdoor outlet up higher on the wall or 2) run a heavy duty extension cord up the wall to the right of the windows and secure it with staples or in some kind of conduit.\n\nThere is an outlet in the kitchen, on the other side of the wall below the upper windows, so I could come off that to install an outlet on the outside of the house. I\u2019m not really inclined to do this because it will look a little crazy to have an outlet right in the middle of the house, and even with the outlet there the plug on the string lights is still away from the house so it wouldn\u2019t reach. Also we plan to re-do this patio in a couple years and at that time I would probably try to build in lighting or more electrical and not need an outlet there.\n\nI\u2019d like to run a heavy duty 12 gauge extension cord up the wall. Regular cable staples are not working, they just won\u2019t go into the mortar and the nail just pops right out and bends. Ideally I could run it through a conduit or raceway, but having trouble finding what would be the best to use to attach to a brick wall. I had used some in my house that are the regular plastic ones with an adhesive back, but I\u2019m not sure that would stick to brick and stay there. Having it enclosed would help protect it from rain, and I can also get waterproof covers for the plug connections and will be using an in-use outlet cover.\n\nAny suggestions for how to get this plugged in safely and without looking too bad?\n\n\n[Light setup ](https://imgur.com/pZbn918)",

    "post_text": "I have an old detached garage that I am dividing to create a workshop.  The roof has trusses that are way out of square at this point, and due to thermal expansion, I don't want to anchor to these in any way.  The trusses are set at 24\" oc.  The garage had a decent concrete floor.\n\nI want to create a wall that is 24' long with a door somewhere along the run.  My idea is to create an upside down floating/freestanding wall anchored to the concrete and walls in 8 or 12 foot sections.  What I mean by upside down floating is that I will install blocks between trusses and halfway hammer long nails in to allow the roof to raise and lower without lifting the wall yet still prevent side to side motion.  The end of the top plates would anchor to the tops of existing wall.  I would build the wall stick style to compensate for unlevel floor or unsquare trusses.\n\nHow would I go about creating a sturdy enough top plate with a run this long and will the concrete anchor be enough to keep it upright?  I also want to be able to hang shelves on the wall.  I have access to the other side of the wall and could run studs to brace that side if need be.\n\nI am just a diy'er on a budget so any help is appreciated.",

Nothing was straight, they used about 200 picture hanging nails (and tried to hammer those into concrete), and it was coming apart. They also painted over the drywall without mudding. We decided we could just rip it all out and start over when we finally got around to it and needed the space. Well, almost 3 years later we're finally getting around to it!\n\n**\\[My Goals\\]**\n\nMy goals with this project are to install a subfloor/underlayment, insulation, drywall, new laminate, and paint. So far I've torn out all the old trimboard, insulation, and laminate but am leaving the drywall and we're just going to mud texture over it and then repaint. In pulling up the old laminate we found a huge 12'' x 12'' hole in the floor that and, after calling my city permit manager, decided was probably put in initially to service a sump pump, but that the builders opted for a french drain instead. She said I could fill it, so I pulled out some of the sand, added some gravel, and poured concrete over.\n\nRight now I'm torn between adding the insulation now or installing the subfloor first. Initially I was going to do the subfloor by throwing down some DMX and OSB on top, mounted to the foundation by tapcon screws, but now I've realized that with the DMX 1-Step I don't actually need to put down OSB and can just lay my laminate down right on top of that. Unfortunately, no one in my area carries DMX 1-Step except Home Depot and Home Depot doesn't stock it, so it has to be ordered with a \\~10 day out time. I really don't want to just sit on my hands for 10 days as I'm starting up a new job on the 20th and my free time is going to be much more limited.\n\n**\\[My Questions\\]**\n\n* Can I go ahead and add my insulation, nailers, and drywall before the DMX comes and do my underlayment / flooring after? How much of a gap do I leave? I've seen some places recommend 1/2'', but I'm worried that's too little as I don't yet know precisely how thick the DMX is or my laminate is. Can I increase it to 1''? Is that too much?\n* I've seen videos of people just gluing the insulation straight to the concrete, which I plan to do and then put my nailers horizontally across the foundation wall. I'm adding about 2.5'' of insulation + 3/4'' pine nailers. How long of tapcon screws do I need and how much do I actually need to go into the concrete?\n* Has anyone here used the DMX 1-Step? How reliable is it to put laminate directly on top? How level should my basement be? On a 3ft long level, in any place I put it down there the bubble remains within the markers, but in some areas the edge of the bubble does touch the line. Is this OK?\n\n**\\[Imgur Album Below\\]**\n\n[https://imgur.com/gallery/yiYGFnY](https://imgur.com/gallery/yiYGFnY)\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/g0vpfCP](https://imgur.com/a/g0vpfCP)",

    "title": "Basement Framing Question",
    "post_text": "https://imgur.com/gallery/R2ZVdoy/new\n\n\nSo I've decided to start framing my basement since the layout is fairly straight forward and open so there isn't a ton of framing to be done with the exception of covering a concrete wall, the bathroom and one wall of a bedroom. Now, I've never  framed anything besides Steven Avery but I think I can pull this off but I do have a question for which I can't find an answer anywhere.\n\nAlong the concrete wall that will be framed in, the duct work runs right along the corner of the floor joists and the wall itself so I can't connect the wall frame directly to the joists.  My initial thought was to frame the wall to just under the ducts and use the planned soffit to connect the wall with the joists.  Once I started looking further at this, I decided that it might not be a good idea since the wall I am framing will be 2x4 and will run into a 2x6 wall which you can sort of see behind the fridge in the pic. if I went with my original plan not only would there be an odd transition between the two walls but I wasn't sure the wall would be sturdy enough if I were to hang a couple of TV's on it.  \n\nSo that brings me to my question:  If I were to run a 2x4 furring strip (or maybe its a ledger board?) as seen in the red strip in the pic along the wall near the top plate of the new wall and then nail the top plate to the furring strip, would that be enough to solidly support the top of the wall.  As it works out, a 2x4 strip would space the framed wall almost perfectly to align with the 2x6 wall further down.  I could then run the soffit without worrying about needing it to support anything besides dry wall.\n\nAny thoughts on this?\n\nThanks\n",

    "title": "[Help] first time homeowner looking to upgrade an old old home.",
    "post_text": "I recently purchased my first home (exciting!) and knew it needed some work in order to make it what i wanted. The market where I purchased the home is growing rapidly so I thought this would be a good investment, either as a rental property or as a long term (6-7 year) flip. \n\nThe house was built in 1900, and has a great foundation and solid bones, man those guys back then knew what they were doing. Dry basement (thinking of adding a sump pump), multi-unit home (upper/lower), and a full unfinished attic. It came with a tenant upstairs who is staying there but that is not my concern right now. \nGeneral Specs:\n2400 sq. ft.\nMirror Apartments - 3 bedrooms, 1 bathroom, dining room, living room, kitchen; each\n\nI didn't realize a lot of the issues I found when moving in, mostly due to the fact that there were tenants on both floors (with kids and a lot of stuff all over the place) when I did the initial walkthrough before I put an offer in and when I was there for the home inspection. So the biggest thing with the house that I've found in the short time that I've been there is that the electrical needs a tremendous upgrade, not in the sense that the wiring is old (it may be old, but it's not knob and tube old), but more so in the sense that there just isn't enough of it, nor is it placed conveniently. Each bedroom only has one outlet, and every outlet in the house (except for the kitchen) is located in the floor boards (literally cut out into the floorboards). The living room and dining room only have 1 or 2 outlets at most, and the kitchen may have two above the sink outside the ones that the appliances are hooked into. Almost all or them have no ground ports (excluding one in the dining room and the one for the appliances in the kitchen). The bedrooms have no overhead fans or lights (only one wall mounted light in each room), and there is wallpaper on everything, including the ceilings. My thought process would be to tear down all the walls and ceilings in the house (room by room of course) starting with the bedrooms, rerun the electrical and add outlets and ceiling boxes to add either a light or a fan to each room. One of the rooms can't really fit a fan in it due to the stairwell that takes up ceiling space making the room an awkward shape. After rerunning the electrical, re-insulate each room and hang up dry wall (the whole house is plaster now, I believe). I'm not sure the legality of it, especially with the permitting and or inspections needed to do my own electrical work. Let me know what you think. I've been reading up on how to do all this, and have friends willing to help who have plenty of experience. I just thought this would be the best option instead of hiring an electrician, which will become pricey.\n\nUnfortunately, I work on the road, so after I purchased the home on a wednesday, I moved in on thursday, and left for work for 3 weeks on friday, so I haven't had much time to spend in the house but when I return I will post pictures of what I'm dealing with! There isn't a real rush on getting the whole or any part of the project done (the house was move in ready), but I am looking for opinions and help on the following (assuming I do most/all of the work myself):\n\n-if its worth upgrading the full electrical (house has breaker boxes [not fuses] seperated for both floors, so not 100% sure on how old the lines currently ran are) and how much adding an outlet to each wall might run. Also if I do run new electrical, should I run wires for the second floor apartment (not hooked up), so that then when I do eventually finish the first floor and move up to the second they would already be ran?\n\n-whether to tear down the plaster in each room, or I was told it would be easier to hang 1/4\" dry wall over the whole thing and refinish it that way? and what the benefits to doing it both ways would be?\n\n-any other ideas or suggestions on what to do, especially if i've missed anything, would be greatly appreciated and thanks for all the help!",

There was a spill and cleanup, but while I was checking dryness on top, it never occurred to me that the real problem was the bottom. After two full days of marinating, we realized that the cover fabric when wet pretty much just bleeds dye. Profusely. \n\nThis is a brand new rental (2 year term) with the same flooring throughout every room. It\u2019s definitely some type of wood. You can feel the grain, and it seems more delicate compared to what I\u2019ve had in past apartments (various laminate, snap in, blah blah). Google suggested hydrogen peroxide, but I either didn\u2019t leave it long enough or it\u2019s useless.

It\u2019s termed \u201cwood style\u201d flooring. The fact they aren\u2019t calling it laminate, as other developers do, makes me wonder if I\u2019ve been duped by WOOD LOOK TILE? Does it feel like wood to the touch? Can I get a guy to swap the bad ones out? Will everything be ok? Tune in next week to find out if I\u2019ve been evicted yet...\n\n2nd edit: just got home and while my spouse does not believe me, I am convinced. ITS NOT WOOD. ITS TILE.

    "post_text": "So in late March I had some time on my hands. I own a 1880's row home in Philadelphia.  I was suspicious that the ceiling in my master bedroom had been lowered from the original height. I cut a little hole in the corner and confirmed this was correct. Years ago the previous owner had framed out and drywalled the ceiling at 8 ft  and just left the original 10ft plaster ceiling closed off (not sure why). \n\nSo we decided to do a little quarantine project and raise these up. Then I realized I should go ahead and rip out the closet and redo it. Then I realized I should rip out the extra framing around the chimney that runs through the room. Then I realized I should add recessed lights. Then I found a 2'x'3 hole in the plaster in the corner during demo, so I should blow in insulation.

All of the floors are hardwood, except the bathroom.  \n \n\nWe have a big problem though \u2013 Home Depot rented us a [large square buff floor sander](https://www.homedepot.ca/en/home/tool-and-vehicle-rental/p.square-buff-floor-sander.09903.html) and a [floor edger](https://www.homedepot.ca/en/home/tool-and-vehicle-rental/p.floor-edger-7.09906.html), which they\u2019ve now admitted was a bad combo.  \n \n\nStill, the large sander is was great \u2013 it was gentle, took a little off the floor at a time, and was easy to use. The floor edger though\u2026 My friend went around the house, and the edger took a HUGE amount off the wood!    \n \n\nI tried my hardest to match the depth the edger got to, but to no avail. The next day I rented a [drum sander](https://www.homedepot.ca/en/home/tool-and-vehicle-rental/p.drum-floor-sander.09905.html) and was able to get down close to the same depth, but there is now a 1 to 2 inch strip between where the drum sander left off and the edger got in.  \n \n\nMy wife and I were going to stain the floors, but we are now painting because we think the damage is too much and we're hopeful the paint will cover our shameful, shameful mistakes. But I still need to get rid of the mostly unsanded strip between the edge of the walls and the middle. What would be the best machine to use? We have a belt sander, palm sander, and an orbital. I\u2019m hesitant to rent the edge sander again, because I\u2019m afraid we might mess up and go even farther into the wood.  \n \n\nAny recommendations would be super, super appreciated! If it helps, we are in Ontario, Canada, so our local reno/rental places are restricted to Home Depot, Home Hardware, and RONA.  \n\n\nI'll be heading to the house tonight after work, so if I can take photos of anything else that will help, please let me know.  \n\n\nThanks!  \n\n\nImages:  \n\n\n[https://imgur.com/TRIWgsx](https://imgur.com/TRIWgsx)\n\n[https://imgur.com/UAzQewz](https://imgur.com/UAzQewz)\n\nh[ttps://imgur.com/QAMNhqf](https://imgur.com/QAMNhqf)\n\n[https://imgur.com/MbRis9P](https://imgur.com/MbRis9P)\n\n \n\nTL;DR: Floor edger went too deep. Drum and giant floor sander can\u2019t meet edger. Left with 1 \u2013 2 inch of mostly unsanded area. HALP!",

I also looked at my furnace wiring and there\u2019s a black wire hooked up to the common port on its wiring panel. I\u2019m no expert on this stuff, but was reading on the google and found that I might have really messed up my furnace by wiring it incorrectly (the way nest told me to in the diagram). I feel like this thing, that should\u2019ve taken 20 minutes max, took my partner and I literally hours to trouble shoot (we tried shutting power off at multiple points of the furnace, replacing the furnace fuse, resetting, we even put the old thermostat back on in the exact same configuration and the furnace is totally dead).\n\nDid nest screw me over here? We literally just replaced our furnace, it\u2019s brand new. I live in Canada and it\u2019s cold. Help. \n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/ptDs3hw",

    "post_text": "UPDATE: Thanks y'all. I think I'm going to wear a respirator and sand down some bits (gloops are latex paint) on a couple spots and completely remove trim and baseboards everywhere else. Thanks for talking me off the ledge, I have a ton of citristrip in the house left by a friend and I could easily have created a massive timesuck for myself.  \n\\--------\n\nI live in a 1931 house in a college town. It's in great shape structurally, but I knew it needed some cosmetic work. Unfortunately, in the last few years it became a student rental owned by out of town landlords and every paint job has been wildly sloppy. There is a teeny tiny hallway I need to paint, and about half of the surface area is doorway trim, cabinet trim, and baseboards. I can't just paint the walls without addressing the trim - just full of GLOBS of paint, and probably some lead paint underneath given the age of the house.\n\nIt looks like the amateur landlord folks who owned it before just painted a new layer of extra gloopy paint every tenant change instead of cleaning the trim properly, and now it's impossible to keep clean as all the bumps and texture accumulate dust etc. (plus two truly massive dogs don't help).\n\nI have stripped paint off some of our wood paneling (which is gorgeous, but they did the same sloppy painting on adjacent walls leading to quarter-size gloops on the bare wood that were never cleaned) and one long windowsill using Citristrip, toothbrushes, scrapers, etc. These were not nearly as coated and were from an addition to the house without lead paint. I do plan on repainting the wood. Most of the trim is flat surfaces, not curved. I just want a normal, not insane paint job and easier-to-clean surfaces.\n\nSo I guess my questions are, I guess:  \n\\- If you have done this, how much of your life did it take up? Was it worth it?  \n\\- What products would you use?  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I didn't get the furnace checked out when I moved in last year (beyond the home inspection), and now it quit and it's clear it wasn't well-maintained. I knew it was older and would need to be replaced in the not-too-distant future, so here I am. By the serial number, it's 18 years old but the 1920s building was renovated in 2007, so I'm assuming about 16 years of use.\n\nI was quoted $7900 in repairs from a big reputable company and about $5000 to replace, with a discount of 15% to do the AC as well, which came out to $10,000. I got another replacement quote from another big reputable company (they didn't evaluate the old furnace), and it was very similar with some differences in the perks (10 years free maintenance rather than 1; also 18-year guarantee for parts and labor, 20 for heat exchanger, and 12 years for everything related to the AC). Finally, a friend knows somebody who owns a couple of rental apt buildings who recommended an independent older guy who seemed really nice. He recommended replacing the inducer motor and flame sensor plus a full cleaning for $380, and said he thinks he can keep it going for another 5-6 years easily.\n\nI should note I do have the money to do the full replacement, but of course, I have other things I'd rather do with that money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome things I've been considering:\n\n\\-of course, I'm wondering if the first company was just scamming to get me to buy an entirely new HVAC system\n\n\\-with inflation, maybe it's better to make big purchases now rather than later? I also just happened to have recently gotten a new credit card with more than enough of a credit limit and 0% APR for 15 months\n\n\\-there's additional work I haven't done in the apartment yet, including some repairs to the floors +/- refinishing all of them, and painting; maybe it's better to get the heavy machinery replaced before doing the decorative stuff?\n\n\\-my energy bill is pretty low, though I know new HVAC should drop it lower and presumably be better for the environment overall\n\n\\-one of the guys said something about I might need a crane to get the AC on the roof if I wait because the next generation is going to be too big for the hatch? Something 13 vs something 14??\n\nWhat would you do if it was you? Thanks for any advice anyone can offer!!",

    "post_text": "I\u2019m not sure if this is the right sub Reddit, so if not I apologize.\n\nMy wife and I bought our first home last year in California, with plans to do some renovations to it this year. We found a contractor through a friend that was well recommended. We met with him in January and February 2022 and went over all of the things we wanted done to the house. The house was built in the 50s, so it was mostly updating electrical, windows and exterior siding, But most importantly we wanted to remove a load bearing wall between the living room and kitchen and install full sliding glass doors in both the living room and kitchen. Since this house was going to be a future rental property, I made sure to tell him verbally multiple times (also in writing through email) that work needed to be planned and legally permitted.\n\nThroughout the whole initial process the contractor was really nice and seemed professional. He sent us an initial quote with a budget for our project. He said he was busy until August 2022, but that we should get started with ordering our windows and doors to get ahead of lead times. We did so and made sure to CC him on all of our decisions for windows and doors. \n\nAugust came and they began demolition on our house. I made sure to ask that he had pulled permits and he said he had. Everything was going pretty well until they started framing our sliding glass doors. My wife wanted a very open layout and our glass doors opened out to a second-story deck. She wanted a lot of sunlight as the doors faced a western sunset. We ordered frameless glass doors and went almost wall-to-wall with the sizing. The living room had about 12 to 14 inches on each side of wall and the bedroom had about 8. When he began to frame out the doors using two by fours to support a header beam, I had a funny feeling about what was going on. I decided to check with the city and found out that while he did apply for permits, it was only for windows and exterior siding. There was nothing on our permits about electrical or any doors and load bearing wall removal.\n\nUnfortunately at this point, most of the demo had already been done. We had a long conversation with our contractor about the plans and permits and he said that he would fix everything. He hired an architect to draw up plans and submitted them to the city for a new permit. They did continue work in the meantime and even reframed the doors with 4 x 4 support posts and Simpson strong ties made of quarter inch steel. Then they were a multitude of small mistakes and issues along the way that also didn\u2019t make me feel great about our situation. I was already googling how to fire your contractor and looking for new help.\n\nUnfortunately, our contractor just called us tonight and informed us that the city is rejecting their plans and permits and the structural engineer that they are JUST NOW hiring is informing them that our doors are too large for the opening. Apparently they are proposing that we need 6 inch steel C channel beams attached to the exterior of our house in order to support the sheer loads on the wall. Obviously, we are very upset about this. I asked the contractor why an engineer was never hired over the summer and he made up some stupid excuses about how it was the architects fault.\n\nAt this point, I want to cut our losses and move on with another more reputable company. Unfortunately, our contractor has already basically charged us our entire proposed project budget to do the work he\u2019s done up to this point. Among a bunch of other small mistakes he made along the way, he also was really shady when proposing the project to us in the first place and left a whole bunch of line items off that we had asked for initially. It was definitely na\u00efve of us to think that the items we had asked for were included in the proposal when they were not explicitly stated.\n\nIn any case, we want to move on and somehow figure out how to recoup our losses. It sounds like we either need some major structural changes to the house, or we need to basically throw away one of our $16,000 doors and start over. At this point, I want to know where legally we stand? We were upfront from the very beginning that we wanted everything designed, planned, engineered, and permitted before any work was done. He lied to us about getting the permits done and performed all of the work anyway before we basically caught it ourselves. We\u2019re now at a point where it sounds like the work he did, that we already paid for, will not be accepted by the city. Is it something that we can sue for? What should our next steps be? I definitely want to move forward with a different contractor, I just don\u2019t want to have to pay for everything all over again. I admit I don\u2019t know much about contractor licensing and permitting, so is this something that he is liable for, or is it all on the homeowner?",

We would see the gap grow in the in winter, but I was never sure if this was simply temp related or snow load on the roof related.  My parents had a few contractors come to do stuff in the attic to try to prevent this, but it never really solved the problem.\n\nWhen I bought the house, I removed the popcorn and had a contractor patch the ceiling with fiberglass mesh tape and durabond.

My general rule of thumb is if I see myself using it more than once throughout my homeownership, I\u2019ll just buy it. \n\nThis got me too annoyed so early on a Monday without my coffee yet. \n\nAny one else have that guy on the block or am I just being an overly dramatic dick?",

More updates to come but for now, that sweet sweet karma,.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall this job was intense. I worked Solid 10 hour days for 8 days straight to get where I am at now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI chose Blue seal and Not blueskin because I had a poor condition half block half poured foundation that I was worried the blue skin wouldn't adhere well to,  despite the primer. In the end I could have done the blue skin; I'd advise this as there is no waiting around for the membrane to dry, you can lay everything as you go and if you got a friend or two you could probably apply the membrane lay some gravel and pipe in about 2 full days. probably worth it for the extra 150 bucks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTotal Canadian Dollar cost\n\nexcavation and back fill -1475  Woot Bob saved me some serious green. here.\n\nmaterial cost:\n\nfor parging, dimple board, gravel, trim piece, rubberized membrane, caulking, filter fabric, fasteners, drill bits, concrete disposal ( steel reinforced), jack hammer rentals etc, was about 2080\n\ntop soil and grading  + grass seed - 415. - pending.deck lumber + footings + fasteners - 685\n\npatio slabs - 500 for slabs, 120 for stone dust. 85 for river rock. - 705\n\nI already owned all the shovels and other tools (pry bars, hammers, drills etc) , masonry tools, power washer, wheelbarrows, ladders, hoses, buckets, etc\n\nGrand total 5360.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was quoted about 10000-15000 dollars by 2 contractors and that was dependent on how easy the excavation was...it was quite difficult on the side yard so I'd got middle of the road. This quote required me jackhammer the concrete and also did not include the deck nor the patio but did include re seeding\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nsaved about $8000 and haven't had a leak in the 4 days of rain this week. Sump pump comes on intermittently so the system is working properly. \n\nor I got it half price with a free  small 9x4 entry deck and 30x16 slab paver patio.",

I am willing to make it look cleaner and more organised but it's hard to find rental friendly solutions. By this I mean I can't drill holes, so no drilled in mirrors, shelves or cabinets. The bathroom has tiles all throughout, making it hard to use heavy duty sticky tapes as they won't resist humidity that well (no windows).\n\n[Picture of the area I want to improve](https://freeimage.host/i/Hao9tyX) This is a picture of the weird area I have on top of the sink, which is ideal to put our things on but looks really messy this way. I am thinking of buying a 3-way vanity mirror which would stand on its own, but other than that I can't think of a good organising solution that would ideally *hide* all our products away.\n\nAny solutions welcome.",

    "title": "DIY 16x16 Paver Patio",
    "post_text": "I was told to x-post this here from r/DIY so here you go. I am near Denver, CO:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wanted a patio, as my house had an enclosed sunroom but no paved space outside to enjoy Denver's 300 days of sunshine. So, this is my DIY install:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/lqLdJAR.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/lqLdJAR.jpg)\n\nFirst, the final product!  Still some dirt and grass work to be done around it. I'm very happy with how it turned out. The pavers are Home Depot Nantucket Variegated Tan Basketweave. 16x16 patio took 3x100 sq ft pallets. They were a bit expensive but I liked the look a lot.\n\nThe total cost of the project - $2,815\n\nPavers - 3X pallets - $1700 from Home Depot\n\nProFlex 48ft Paver Edging kit - $60 from Home Depot\n\nSakrete PermaSand - 2 x buckets - $40 from Home Depot\n\n3 yards crushed concrete gravel, 1 yard of concrete sand - $305 - From local landscape supply\n\nPick, tamper, shovel, paint, and wheelbarrow - $120 - From Home Depot\n\nSkid-steer rental - $370 for the day - Home Depot\n\nPlate Compactor rental - $150 for 1 day and 4 hours - Home Depot\n\nFuel for friends - Pizza and Beer - $50\n\nFuel for machines - $20\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe initial marked dig zone. 16x16 ft plus a 1ft buffer on each side. The AC unit had to be slid over just an inch or two to clear the edge of the foundation where the pavers would come by.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/heNHl4c.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/heNHl4c.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome poor displaced flowers growing in the dig zone. I'll have to plant more, they're pretty. So long, flowers.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/8SMwyZQ.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/8SMwyZQ.jpg)\n\nThank goodness my father-in-law was visiting with his truck. Once we calculated the grade (4in drop over 16ft run, or 1/4 inch per foot of fall) we realized we'd be moving 3 yards of dirt at least. WIth the tough clay soil, I sprung for a skid-steer (about $370 for the day) so we could get the earth as close to our desired grade as possible without breaking our backs. This machine was worth every penny and if I hadn't gotten it I would've been overwhelmed with the manual labor required to level this large area.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/sL0uRsI.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/sL0uRsI.jpg)\n\nOnce we had a rough grade, we ran string lines and levelled them to check how deep we need to go with the skid steer. It could barely cut the clay layer we found, but did ok. Overall, we planned for clearance of 6\" below the patio door - 3.5\" for gravel, 1\" for the sand layer on top, and then 1.5\" for the pavers, so they would sit just below the patio door. We marked the foundation with a level pencil line to know our target of 6\" depth, then ran the string out to about 17 feet, marked it every four feet, and measured down to the dirt. Every 4 feet from the foundation, the dirt needed to fall an inch lower, ending at 10\" down from the string line at the end of the patio.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/QO8seV2.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/QO8seV2.jpg)\n\nRough grade done with the skid-steer, and tiles moved from the front to the back using the skid steer bucket since we had it anyway. I still had to manually load the bucket, with a total weight of 5,200 lbs of pavers, all loaded and unloaded by hand. Still, way better than wheelbarrow. This was the end of day 1, because I was too tired to continue.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/9892ng6.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/9892ng6.jpg)\n\nI used this to scope out the grade in the absence of real surveying equipment. Mostly the string level was used with multiple strings run to verify the fall was consistent and the patio level left to right, I just spot checked using the scope to look at a tape measure and check elevation off the ground of some high spots. It worked ok, but the strings worked better. It's a rifle scope zip tied to a camera tripod with a level attached.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/WOlealp.jpg?1](https://i.imgur.com/WOlealp.jpg?1)\n\nDay 2: After we finished work with the skid-steer, there was some fine tuning to be done with the pickaxe and shovels. I had several string lines rigged up and marked high spots with a paint can, picked them down level, and moved the dirt to low spots. This part was all manual. Tough digging, but only a little left to get it smooth.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/BWNAr1m.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/BWNAr1m.jpg)\n\nHand tamping some loose spots to check level, and raking around the dirt to get it as flat as possible for gravel.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/54rOLxA.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/54rOLxA.jpg)\n\nWhile I was working the dirt the last little bit, the gravel and sand came! I ordered 6.5 tons of crushed concrete gravel for the base (3 yards total, as 16ft x 16ft area with a desired 3.5 inch depth required 2.8 yards of gravel,) and 1.5 tons of concrete sand (1 yard total, as 16ft x 16ft x 1 inch = 0.79 yard)   The landscaping store calculated the tonnage based on my requested yardage. I ended up with about 3/4\" yard extra gravel and exactly the right amount of sand, so I don't think their weights were that close. Total cost, $305 delivered from a local shop.  [https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/construction/cubic-yards-calculator.php](https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/construction/cubic-yards-calculator.php)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/BS0nPIn.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/BS0nPIn.jpg)\n\nI enlisted some help moving the gravel to the back yard, one wheel barrow full at a time. Yes, the two of us shoveled and moved nearly 16,000lbs of material by hand. Probably 80-90 loads in the wheel barrow. This was the hardest work of the project without power tools. I was shooting for 3 layers of \\~1\" thick, compacting between each layer.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/VdK9JoF.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/VdK9JoF.jpg)\n\nBuilding up the gravel base, one wheelbarrow full at a time. I got a little too heavy with the gravel on the first layer and it was maybe 2\" instead of my 1\" planned but it worked out. Wetting the gravel is important while compacting, otherwise the  compactor will just sink into the dry stuff and leave big troughs. I would wet it until it was all damp, run the surface one direction with the compactor, wet it again, and run perpendicular on the next pass. It was hot and sunny so the water evaporated quickly. The compactor was a handful near the house - it pulled more than I expected for basically just a vibrating plate. Compactor rental ran me $150 for two days, (used on gravel and tiles) but there's no way to get a good compact surface by hand.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/pVpzPL2.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/pVpzPL2.jpg)\n\nCompleted gravel base. This was two and a half layers of gravel, totalling about 3 1/2 - 4\" of gravel once compacted. I used a string line set at my desired grade (1/4\" per foot fall away from the house for drainage) and a can of marking paint to mark high and low spots. I'd rake out the high spots, and fill the low spots and compact. I did a final check with a screed board, just to find any low spots, then did my final compaction. Again, wet the gravel, make passes length wise, wet, make passes width wise. Continue until the compactor doesn't leave a trail. I laid about 6\" to 1ft extra gravel around where the pavers would be to keep the base stable (18x18 roughly.)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/dA7w467.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/dA7w467.jpg)\n\nWith the gravel base done, I started the sand screed. First, I put in the paver edging - about $60. It's plastic edging that gives me a square starting point for laying tiles, and also retains the tiles and the sand base to keep them from separating with time. The sand base does NOT get compacted, to give a \"squishy\" surface for the pavers to sink into and settle. I used two 1\" PVC pipes and an old board that was square and straight from an old door jamb renovation. Fill the area with sand, and level with the screed board over the pipes. Once I had a square done, I'd remove the PVC pipes and move to the next area. I'd fill in the gaps left by the pipe once I started laying pavers.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/0iC9Qhh.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/0iC9Qhh.jpg)\n\nCompleted sand screed, ready for pavers! First two pavers are in the corner. I started in the far corner and squared it to the left side of the house, and laid up to the house. I wanted any cut edges to be at the house and not on the tiles extending into the yard, so they would be retained better and look a little nicer. As it turned out, I did not need to make any long cuts as the patio was 16x16 and the pavers were 2ft square. My measurements were good enough that it laid right up to the house.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/5t9LXHX.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/5t9LXHX.jpg)\n\nThe end of day 2 - we were exhausted after gravel, sand, and laying the first rows! I was getting really excited here but ran out of light and steam. We laid a couple in an L shape is so I could get out the door, which kind of made it more difficult later on to continue my desired laying direction, but oh well.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/fqoOfSk.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/fqoOfSk.jpg)\n\nDay 3! Completed laying except for one paver I had to cut to fit around a conduit. After I put each tile down, I'd use a rubber mallet to tap it square with the rest. The pavers were heavy, maybe 40lb for the 2 x 1 ft and 80lb for 2 x 2 ft, but because they were big the laying went very quickly. They were also not uniform thickness (by design,) but they were fairly square and easy to lay just dropping them in and tapping them with a mallet to square them up. I kept a flat prybar in my belt so I could wedge them around if needed to get a uniform gap.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/3vTuXaz.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/3vTuXaz.jpg)\n\nBecause the pavers were not uniform thickness due to the design, I didnt want to run the compactor right on top of it and chip off the corners, so I moved plywood sheets around under it. It was surprisingly hard to control the compactor, it very aggressively only went forward when throttled up. This was really loud.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/Cy5iucp.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Cy5iucp.jpg)\n\nWith the pavers compacted, my wife swept in the polymer joint sand - Sakrete Permasand. The sand has a polymer which sets when activated with water and binds together to make a nice seal and keep out weeds and water. The trick to avoid discoloration of the tiles is to get ALL the sand off the tile faces (broom and a light leaf-blowing) and be very careful while watering it - only water it enough until it stops absorbing more, don't let water bead and run along the sand lines.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/Esh6q4n.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Esh6q4n.jpg)\n\nThe gaps weren't perfect as the tiles had some variation, but overall, fine for the look I was going for with a flagstone type appearance. With the joint sand in, it looks much more uniform up close. Sand is the last step!\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/McvTn3N.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/McvTn3N.jpg)\n\nAnd all completed! Thanks for looking!\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/2mUNejs.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/2mUNejs.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFull imgur album:\n\n[https://imgur.com/gallery/QzbsjqG](https://imgur.com/gallery/QzbsjqG)",

    "post_text": "Didn't know where to post this because we didn't take enough progress pics for r/DIY, but I still thought it should be shared. My wife and I recently finished some minor cosmetic renovations on our kitchen and bathroom and we are very happy with the results. We did most of the work ourselves so we were able to keep the costs reasonably low, and still end up with a great transformation. We live in Michigan in the Metro Detroit area.\n\nWe didn't want to do a full teardown and rebuild because we knew there weren't many options to change the layout, and we feel that it is pretty well laid out for the space we have to work with. The main thing I wanted was the new stone countertops to replace the old and outdated Formica. We really like the look of undermount sinks and my wife found a quartz patter that she really liked at the sample display. Once we had that picked out we sort of built the color scheme around the countertop pattern.  We had old honey Oak Cabinets that are very common in my area and usually seem to make a kitchen look outdated. We knew with the new countertop that white would be a good match so we painted all of the cabinets with the Nuvo Kit. Had to take off all of the doors to do this but we left the boxes on and painted the outsides. We also used a Kreg Jig that I borrowed from a friend to add new cabinet and Drawer Hardware. For the floors we used vinyl plank flooring over the tiles that were there for both kitchen and bathroom. This allowed us to refresh the look without putting in new tile or tearing up flooring. For the bathroom this was a little tough because I had to pry off the cove base tile and then put new Floor trim to cover the gap but that also turned out great. I was a little skeptical about the vinyl over tile, but it came out really nice and Vinyl seems to be much easier to clean than tile. \n\nOverall budget was around $14000. The biggest portion of that was the Countertops (\\~$5200) and the appliances (\\~4000$)\n\nBefore/After Pics:  [https://imgur.com/gallery/nrbiHh1](https://imgur.com/gallery/nrbiHh1)\n\nI can go into more detail if desired but for now I will just include that main bullet points.

The previous owner was older and she paid somebody to repaint all the walls, but they didn't clean them at all. They literally painted over hooks and such, so clearly I'm going to have to prime and repaint. I'm bouncing between kilz oil based and B-I-N shellac. For reference, I have cats, a hamster,a leopard gecko and a \"grounded\" red eared slider with a healing shell crack, so I have to consider their health when painting. I know bin dries fast and doesn't smell as strong or have a smell that liners super long, but it's EXPENSIVE. I have over 2k sq ft to cover, and I'm already looking at costs to replace the carpets upstairs and in the two rooms on the main floor. Would kilz fumes be dangerous to the animals for a decent chunk of time? I know I'll have to turn off the ac so they don't circulate and such, but what are my best options? I would love to strip the wall to the drywall, but that's just not feasible.",

And yet after awhile it still leaks a little out of the airgap. I\u2019ve taken the air gap apart and there\u2019s no obstruction and I cleaned out the garbage disposal and cleaned out the connector where the pipe hooks up. And even got a brand new pipe from the air gap just to make sure. And yet\u2026 water still comes out of the air gap.  I had a friend who does some DIY plumbing look at it and he\u2019s stumped too. Do I hire an appliance person for this? Or a plumber? Any tips on mysterious air gap issues?",

    "post_text": "We have a mouse issue. We've had a pest service come out and do some poisons and patching of holes. But I think they missed a major entry point. There is a vent outside of the kitchen, right over a low roof point, that is basically open. It's maybe a foot long and has a little \"door\" just inside of it. I think it is the primary entry point because I once heard mice banging around inside near there. So a couple of questions:\n\n1. Are stoves always hooked up to vent outside?\n2. How might one best cover a vent like that? I'm not sure there's any mesh that can be hooked up that'd be effective over a big space like that.\n3. Can one stuff steel wool into the vent on the top of the oven itself? I spotted a little friend in there once, but I don't want to mess with a necessary vent.\n\nAm glad to clarify anything in this post! Thanks for any help in advance!",

    "post_text": " Hi, would love feedback from this awesome community! My question is about heat!\n\nI'm converting a 10x20 ft attached garage into finished space for an in home office.\n\nI'm in growing zone 6a in the lower Hudson Valley of NY so expect to need heat mid Oct through late April. I'll be in the room generally 8am - 6pm Monday - Friday.\n\nOption 1) I am getting a price to connect my oil fueled hot water baseboard into that room. I expect that this new room would be on the same zone as the bedroom floor of my house, which we typically leave at 70 night and day. If I go this route I would not have the ability to turn the heat down way low when I'm not in the room because the thermostat would be powering a separate section of my house.\n\nOption 2) I have a friend that can hook up an electric baseboard in the new room for no cost except the material. I expect to get 2 five-foot electric baseboard units, 1 for each side of the room. This is certainly the cheaper option upfront. It would also be its own zone so between 6 p.m. and 8 a.m. the next morning I would set the thermostat to be really low. I know the cost to run an electric baseboard is much higher than oil though.\n\nI don't have an estimate for the oil-fueled hot water baseboard option yet (HVAC professional is coming to check it out today), but would love to hear feedback on what the best option here is and about how long it might take me to break even if I end up going the oil fueled hot water baseboard route",

    "post_text": "Hey everyone! I recently built my second putting green on my land and thought I would share details in case anyone wanted to know what it took (don't all raise your hand at once now). Unfortunately, Tiger Woods will not be visiting this course anytime soon from the looks but I gave a valiant effort. Now I am a Top Golf legend but I'm definitely not an expert so any tips are appreciated!\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/6dxWjbW](https://imgur.com/a/6dxWjbW)\n\nIt is a Nasa themed course for my outer space themed geodesic dome airbnb next to it.\n\nFew notes: I didn't do a fringe bc it seems like it makes the process alot more complicated and I want to feel more putt putt style aka I chose the easy path. \n\nI would have never had to use any concrete if the crushed limestone I had delivered actually came at the size they told me it would be (1/4 but was closer to 1/2 to 1in). I could have made a big ordeal with rock quarry about this but I let them make it aka I chose the easy path. I made limestone into limeade I guess you can say............ok let's begin\n\nMaterials and Cost\n\n1. 6X15Ft all turf mats Green $299 on sale\n2. 1/4 or less Crushed Limestone (Base 1) 1 Cubic Yard Delivered $100\n3. Cement Mix Bags 50lbs 7x$8 (Base 1.5ish lol) $56\n4. 8 Cubic Ft Decomposed Granite Fines and about 1 100lb bag #30 Silver Sand (Base 2&amp;3) $75\n5. Edge Stones $50\n6. Sod Cutter, Lawn Roller and Plate Compactor Rental $250 (Home Depot)\n7. Landscape Fabric, Weed Killer, and 3 Inch Finishing Nails $60\n8. Cups and Flags $50\n9. Infill Silica Sand for Turf $50\n\nExtra Tools I Had Already\n\nManual Compactor\n\nTransfer Shovel\n\nRake\n\nWater Hose\n\nHole Digger\n\nRubber Mallet\n\nSeed Spreader\n\n4 Ft. Level\n\nMarking Spray Paint\n\nOne Roll of Bender Board (costs $40 if you need it though..I have a good bit on hand)\n\nTotal - $991\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSteps\n\n1. Mark your areas using  marking spray paint and use your turf to get the shape if you need too. Just be careful not to get spray paint on the turf. I did about 2 ft all around wider than the turf to add my landscaping around.\n2. Use the Sod Cutter, Transfer Shovel, and rake to get out about 4-5 inches of the ground making sure it's as level as you can make it. This is by far the hardest part from a pure labor stand point. I was lucky to have a friend help and it made it so much easier. My land was slanted some so one end had about 5 inches taken out and the other end only needed about 3 to become more level.\n3. I used the turf to put bender board about half way around it to help just help form the shape when I did the first bases. I wasn't sure what I was going to put around the green yet as land scraping (mulch, rocks, etc) but I wanted to be able to have it separated best I could. \n4. We then put the base 1 (crushed limestone that was not as small as I was told it would be...size matters here..that's what she said)  about 1-1.5in inch down and used the mini plate compactor to compact it as much as we could. Check your level as well\n5. Our compactor breaks thanks to Newton's law so we have to go trade it out at Home Depot Rentals. Skip this step I would say\n6. We put down about an 1 inch of the concrete mix, spread it out with a rake, check your level and spray it down LIGHTLY with some water. We then quickly ran the compactor over it so it didn't stick to the compactor or become too wet (gigidy)  Then you can give it another light spray. \n7. Now, this and almost final base step I was told to use decomposed granite fines. I heard sand sucks but I saw everyone using sand so I couldn't decide. I got some decomposed granite fines from a local rock place and picked it up in my truck. I laid out about 1 inch across it and ran the compactor over it. I was not happy with the final smoothness though even using a lawn roller over it. Check your level and fill any spots that don't make it work. Hit it with a quick light water spray\n8. I decided to put the #30 silver sand over it and I think it was the best choice. I was using my seed spreader but it didn't function properly as one could guess at this point. I just spread it out and put the lawn roller over it to do the final compaction.  I checked my level constantly as well. This was about 1/2 inch on final layer or slightly less. Very thin layer\n9. We then placed the turf on the base finished gently. This turf had premarked holes so I just marked the spots for them with spray paint. I then lifted up the turf and used my hole digger to make the holes about 4 inches down. You should do this as quick as you can because the longer everything dries over a day or two the harder it is to dig these holes now. \n10. You can now place your cups and flags in the holes\n11. I decided to use the crushed limestone bigger pieces as my perimeter border along with some edge stones from Home Depot. I lined the edge stones all the way around the green making them level throughout.  I put the limestone around the extra dug out perimeter and removed the bender board.\n12. I put some small plants around, grabbed some random space decor, put up some string and solar spot lights, some paver steps, and attempted to make Happy Gilmore proud. \n\nIf you read this long, then you are a saint and will live forever. Let me know what you think!",

    "title": "Mostly DIY 3/4 Bath Results",
    "post_text": "https://imgur.com/a/kPedYCy\n\nHello everyone,\n\nI am sharing the results of my mostly diy bath job. I recently posted about my kitchen you may remember. Sorry I didn't take a before picture! Or really that many pictures at all. I guess the novelty wears off during the second reno and changes to lets get this shit done. \n\nSo this is the second project I have attempted on this level and I have no previous experience or background in this sort of thing. I mention this because I know there are a lot of people like me out there thinking about embarking on something similar. The best part of a bath remodel is that you can shut the door and walk away for a few days. So if you have 2 bathrooms than go for it! You got this!\n\nSo for this project I had to call the pro's in a few times. Ill includ the price later in the post. The first time was for removal of the old shower pan, installation of a new pan, and having it properly pitched. I just couldn't find a surefire way for me to DIY this. I think I recall Kerdi made something but it was to expensive. I also had a pro install the shower glass door. It was included with the purchase of the glass so why not. Quick 20 minute installation. \n\nThe hardest part for this project was laying the tile on the floor. I don't like working with small tiles and the floor is not flat. \n\nOne final thought, a question for the pro's out there. Look at the 3rd photo, the photo with the green chair. If you look closely you can see another layer of tile. I removed all the original tile to find another layer of grouted and identical tile. It get's stranger. I recently helped a friend demo his old shower and we discovered the same thing had been done in his shower. Late 80's construction Miami area. Different subdivisions. Gotta be a reason behind it.\n\nOk stop rambling, lets talk prices. Its been a few months so my memory is a little foggy. Ill try my best. \n\nMiami Florida area prices\n\nDemo of old pan, installation of new pan, and new water shut off valve. $400 \nPitching of pan. $150\nGlass door. $700 Free installation\nAll pros were found through the Thumbtack app fwiw\n\nTile ~600 I used top of the line Italian tile from Happy Floors. The best tile company imo.

    "post_text": "Hi /r/HomeImprovement! I am a new homeowner with a potentially dumb question..\n\nI am looking to add a shade sail to my rooftop deck area. Please see my poor drawing here for a vague idea of what the deck looks like: https://imgur.com/a/PWhtihq\n\nThe \"unique\" thing is: I would want to be able to put it up occasionally rather than have it be a permanent fixture. I have no idea if this is feasible. Most of the time it would be stored in a box on the roof.\n\nI am wondering, since it would not be a permanent fixture, can I buy some strong magnets to attach the shade sail to the metal roof of the stairwells in the picture? I am picturing buying magnets and climbing rated carabiners. I currently use magnets to hold the lighting and they seem to hold very well. During a sunny day, I would just attach the 4 carabiners on each corner D-ring of the shade sail to each magnetic anchor point and the sail would sit above the hanging lighting that is currently there.\n\nThe two issues I foresee:\n\n-Wind force. I am hoping that since this would only be up when in use, this wouldn't be a major concern.\n\n-Slack in the sail due to not having enough tension at anchor points. I'm hoping if I can get a properly sized sail, I can balance tension/slack in the sail vs. pulling force on the metal anchor points.\n\nIs this feasible or no? I would like to do this in the easiest way possible, preferably without drilling into the house. Thanks in advance for any guidance!",

    "post_text": "Hey all. My 8 year old Samsung dryer (electric on a 30A circuit) stopped working the other day when it kept thinking the door was open when it wasn't. A few troubleshooting steps later and I called my repair guy. He came out today and identified the problem: part of the wiring harness inside that connects to the front door sensor had came loose from it's hooks and had been rubbing on the drum, causing one of the three wires to be almost completely exposed and nearly broken. A full repair (new harness and labor) would be about $300, so I asked him what he thought about me just splicing in some new wire where the old wire was damaged. He said that would work just fine. The original wire is 20 awg tinned copper strands. \n\nWhile I've since found some 20 awg wire I could have used, I couldn't find it at the time so I used some 16 awg tinned copper stranded wire for the replacement section, with 18-22 awg butt connectors on each end (the 16 awg fit into it fine). After crimping I slid some heat shrink wrap over the connections and shrunk it up, and made sure to keep the harness in it's retention hooks while lowering the top of the unit. Dryer fired up fine after this. \n\nMy question is basically this - would you view my repair as a temporary solution, or a more permanent solution? If temporary.... how temporary? If I was super paranoid I could replace the 16awg with the 20 awg I found and bust out my soldering iron... but I just wonder if you'd view the way I tackled it as a long-term solution, or if I should be planning to replace the harness (or get a new dryer, or bust out the soldering iron) sometime soon. WWYD? Am I stupid or am I overly paranoid?",

    "title": "Only heating the lower part of a room?",
    "post_text": "Ok, this requires a bit of background.\n\nI live in an old farmhouse in Ohio, and we have a second building that looks like it was built as a kind of \"man cave\" with a bar and some space for a pool table. Recently an old friend of mine has fallen on hard times and I've let him crash in there. Unfortunately, it's getting cold, and keeping the place heated with the floor heaters has been very expensive ($130 a month increase in electricity)\n\nWe've tried a number of ideas for how to reduce that cost, mostly involving reducing the area that we need to heat. First we closed off the second floor with sheets of insulation, then we installed thermal room divider curtains, then we brought in thicker carpet to help 'insulate' the floor better, then we used the spare curtains to try and cover the walls to keep heat in that way.\n\nMost recently we've had pretty good luck with moving the thermal curtains to have an area for just the bed and the desk. That plus an oil-based space heater has kept it decently warm for not too much electricity. However, the building has 9 ft ceilings and a lot of that heat is going upwards. To the point where if you're sitting down, it's cold, but if you stand up, your head is comfortable.\n\nThere IS a pellet burner out there, but it apparently wasn't properly installed so I'd need to redo the vents, install an intake vent, and from what we've calculated with the cost of the pellets, wouldn't actually save us a lot of money.\n\nWhat I'm looking to do now is to cut the space that we're heating down to the lower part of the room, in a way that is temporary and won't set me back a lot of money.\n\nI have a few ideas, but I'm a bit unsure about the details, so here's what I've got so far:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Material options:**\n\n1, More curtains - Pro: good thermal insulation, can just buy more of what I got for the room, can be used as regular curtains when friend leaves. Con: HEAVY, might not stay up, could be dangerous if it fell\n\n2, Bed sheets - Pro: Light, cheap, easy to work with. Con: thermal insulation will depend on the sheet type, will probably need to connect more than one sheet together to cover the space\n\n3, Tent (Either literally an old tent that I cut the material out of or like a rain cover) - Pro: designed to be lived in already, could probably use rigging material to keep it in the air. Con: Tents are expensive, and the ones I've been in are still kind of cold\n\n4, Thermal blanket (One of those silver astronaut ones) - Pro: Supposed to keep you pretty warm. Con: I have literally never worked with one.\n\n5, Painter's floor cover. (fabric, not plastic) - Pro: I have one, and it's probably big enough for the space. Con: No idea how well that'll keep in heat. Also my wife would likely want it back when painting this winter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Techniques for hanging material:**\n\n1, Grommets - I put grommets in the corners and probably center of the material and an eye hook screw in the ceiling and then hang everything together with twine. I could also support the center grommet with a pole in the center, but that would make staying there less comfortable, and could be knocked over.\n\n2, PVC pipe assembly - I could build a little roof out of PVC pipe and keep it up with poles at the corners of the room. There are a few problems with the room features but those are basically solved by taking the curtains that are on the walls and using them to make effectively a smaller building inside the room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI realize that in the long term getting better insulation in the walls/floor is the better option, and also that I'm effectively asking how to make a large scale blanket fort, but I need a cheap and fast way to keep my friend warm. Does anyone have any thoughts on how I can accomplish this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImages of the room:  [https://imgur.com/a/TL0U0ik](https://imgur.com/a/TL0U0ik) \n\n(The panorama mode on my phone apparently got some weird lighting artifacts from the fan being on to move some of the air from the space heater's radiator around)",

Why is the main disconnect a single lever? It should still be a double pole unit right? Is this particular breaker just designed that way?\n2. What is under the panels of the units marked \"garage 220V\", are those just panels to cover up the knockouts after the breakers have been removed?\n3. WTF are R--HANDLES? Why are some spots labelled R?\n\nThe stove and heating is gas so those will not really factor in. The biggest draws I expect would be the A/Cs in the winter and temporary kitchen draws (kettles, microwave, instant pot, etc), along with the fridge, chest freezer, and a couple gaming computers.\n\nI feel like adding up the numbers the main breaker should handle the load just fine -- worst case in the summer I might have to turn off one or both A/C (window units) while running the dryer.\n\nThank you for your time and help!",

    "post_text": "This past week I had an issue in which my septic tank overflowed into my yard. I had a company out to pump the tank and diagnose the issue. This company (company A) recommended a rejuvenation of the system, called a Terralift. Estimated cost from them is around $7,000 for a Terralift which is only guaranteed for 2 years. Company A only pumped the tank and did not doing any exploratory digging before quoting the work. \n\nHad company B out who dug down and looked at the D-box and said that I need a new system. Said there are roots growing into it and there are only 2 active drain fields and most septic systems have 3-5. This company told me they do not do Terralifts because they \"don't work\" and are a scam. \"Anything I would do to repair my current system would be a band-aid\". Said new system would be between 12-18k depending on soil and where the city health department said it had to be placed.\n\nCompany C - I called but they have a 2 month wait (so have not been out), he also mentioned that he does not do Terralifts because they aren't recommended. \n\nCompany D - is coming next week to do a full inspection, but charges $300 to come out and look. This company talked about how Company A \"always tells people they need a bunch of work when there is nothing wrong.\" Seemed to be pretty negative about other companies when I asked for a second opinion, but they do perform Terralifts.\n\nEverything I read online talks about how great Terralifts are, but seems to be a temporary solution. I have doubts about spending 7k on a temporary solution for a few years. My house was built in the 60s, I would bet the system is original, but don't know for sure. I have heard rumors the city may hook my neighborhood to city sewer and reached out to the city for more info, but am waiting to hear back. \n\nDoes anyone have experience with Terralift for their septic system (good or bad)? Is there any other factors or things I should try before going down the route of septic system replacement?",

    "title": "Non-permanent, non-hardwired ceiling mount for LED pendant lights? (pucks)",
    "post_text": "I scored some LED puck lights that are rechargeable, colorful, etc.  So far so good.  They don't use the 3 AAA or AA batteries a lot of cheap sets use and burn through, though this set was fairly inexpensive too (the jury is out on how well the battery life and lifetime does on these - they're new).  Even if they burn out quick, they're rechargeable, at least.  A couple of hours is sufficient, per use.  \n\nThat said, I have a ktichen island that wasn't built-in, so there's no electric, gas or water.  It's just a glorified table, but you can sit at it as a breakfast bar or for dinner.  What would be nice, and look nice, is to have some pendant lights hanging from the ceiling as \"bar\" lighting.  \n\nWith puck lights like these - small and lightweight, remote controlled, color-variant, and being magnetic (so you can easily remove/dismount/unstick them to recharge or repurpose them), I might be able to get something that looks like one of those [retractable clotheslines](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61IqCMZCOJL.jpg) that I could stick to the ceiling somehow (Command Strips comes to mind) and attach the lights on the end of the cord to have as \"pendant\" bar lights.  \n\nI'm obviously trying not to drill holes or hardwire anything here (I don't like to make permanent things like this, and like to leave options open for later, redesign, moving, etc.).  Those hook &amp; loop \"Velcro\" Command Strips hold 10lbs (some, more than that), so I could attach the mount to the ceiling with that since the lights are only a few ounces, and would still be, with a cord and perhaps with a lightweight lampshade attached for style.  \n\nIs there something available like this already?  They sell [these assembled already](https://www.amazon.com/Operated-Wireless-Hardwired-Chandelier-Rechargable/dp/B0BPLGHCMG/ref=sr_1_8?crid=1GLVC12ROQZVJ&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Bm5mUFO-TaUHV790ry5fSri1hCu667Falktwyd1VE9t8WFErPWifAcw4I1NDF9FWQUa1HqA_X6BwKi9QHvjlaGZgl8itJgzaEvtbLZ-jSchQoWAdttpwD8mMkvfCwCKf2Mq6wQ5uJfb2_gBc5pzXuRYAcytUXIT9dnT0MQs6TGWeKogTWoupCGeO_PoZ-6UZtPAq1uox_IgdWtSRgk3a5zl482seuIgb6fSYs5FlHDD6Vh8uTs6juFFHK9rMoFWpqX758RRh4cgXVbjp-RnB8daWuHHqlopTi3KRVTqBcNw.IAZEH5WE6c-NzVKZZmb7G1PUfs38R_XCvh06F18t2QU&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=battery+operated+pendant+light+with+remote&amp;qid=1760583027&amp;sprefix=battery+operated+pendant+light%2Caps%2C214&amp;sr=8-8), but they're upwards of $80-$100+ and require drilling/screws, and I'm hoping for a cheaper DIY solution that looks nice.  A bonus would be puck lights with a battery-operated wall \"[switch](https://www.amazon.com/Energizer-Battery-Operated-Wireless-58822-T1/dp/B098BN5KSD/ref=sr_1_5?crid=2SIYZ089F3KHJ&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.xOfPUrkBAq5bUh_90vMLc97JSlXAT4KN5ZlLDXfFgoiFTJpJsbr1cqQcmFg4bG8uvKdmSywcsGpEPDxK3Uf8rH_aZPgcjSXkEnkWWw391zClT7H31VV3GRPfgX3_zp5M2VFqC2qUlGbhrSgU3x5fD7gNQTVLxlFIajzNU9qm1_KCuuJ-k-411DdMQEM9bxDhnTWsQT6CnnDrVQCO04r6xHVHaRzPEC-AD2twrh4PqyJUA2wG3K5JpLa3PwxZI-XpuPL0OIi7VvWavMRatVE4zmDJwPL0ueJ6Q3-NTnAcIIg.sovpx9NiTklqFkTXu4vMvDxSkU_JwiY2obyg1e4t_Og&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=remote+wall+switches+for+puck+lights&amp;qid=1760584154&amp;sprefix=remote+wall+switches+for+p+lights%2Caps%2C526&amp;sr=8-5)\" (remote control), but the remote I have is sufficient.

The puzzle will be printed on a 3'x4' poster, mounted between two thin sheets of acrylic. My plan is to use standoffs, like [these](https://www.amazon.com/Alise-Hardware-Advertising-QS519G-8P-Stainless/dp/B07H72F9XY), to attach the pieces of acrylic at all four corners. The end result would look something like [this](https://thediyplaybook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/diy-acrylic-board-11-scaled.jpg).\n\nThe problem: I cannot actually drill into the wall at our venue. Instead, I want to hang the sign from a series of pre-existing hooks on the wall, as shown in this [photo](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/56ecc64559827eaf264ed867/1528409358073-WNOFABUDEQG2C50F5JG5/image-asset.jpeg). I have been unable to find any standoffs w/ ends meant to attach to hooks rather than screw directly into a wall.\n\nI am looking for advice on how best to mount on these hooks. Should I screw some other piece into the back of the standoffs with an edge with a lip that can hang on the hook? Have I not been searching the right name when looking for alternative attachment pieces? Should I just use the standoffs to hold the acrylic sheets together, and attach a piece along the top of the acrylic that hangs right on the hooks? Any help or general advice is greatly appreciated!",

    "post_text": "tl;dr: I'm a building manager who needs a button in an office pressed via a remote (cell phone, internet?)\n\n----\n\nI'm the building manager (security, maintenance, furniture mover, handyman, jack of all trades) of a building in a city. It's been here for 30 years and we moved in within the last 6... A couple years ago, a high-rise-condo had been built across the street and they filed a complaint with the city saying our HVAC system on the roof was far too loud. Long Story Short: They're overhauling our HVAC system and the process will take 5-6 months.\n\nThe construction workers need access to many rooms and escorts to many areas. I CANNOT duplicate the one key that accomplishes this (Medico, locksmiths nearby don't have the blank or won't even bother plus the key is too much of a liability to be duplicated, it's the skeleton for the entire building) so basically I'm never in my office. The problem with that: there are 4 doors that are held shut by a mag-lock and can ONLY be opened by pressing a button downstairs in my office. It disables the magnetic hold for 20-seconds. The idea is that when somebody needs to go onto the roof or through the service door, they press an intercom button and I'm supposed to press the button.\n\nTHIS BLOWS now that I need to constantly be around opening doors and escorting these guys. I've been calling my boss asking her to leave her office, enter mine and press the button at least 10 times a day and she's asked if I can rig somthing up to work instead.\n\nThe button is just a simple small red button on the underside of my desk. It's got 5v DC running through it, but I have no idea if I'll cause a catastrophic grounding problem if I cross streams with another device (Phone System, Computer, Intercom \"Beep\") so it seems as though the simplest solution is to hook up some USB-based motor (is servo the term?) and activate it via my phone through either RDP (remote desktop) or a web interface... when activated, just making the motor bump the switch (I can work out that part, it's the computer-to-reality mechanism I'm stumped at).\n\nCan anybody offer any assistance as to what'd be a good start?\n\n(Doors cannot be propped open, keys cannot be copied, I need to press this button remotely)\n\n----\n\nEdit: \"CDRom\" seems to be the new [Disco ball](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/a8a2v/what_is_the_official_name_for_those_mirror_disco/)\n\nI'm working on the CD-Rom Drive solution but I'd be interested in hearing about a non-mechanical solution too if one exists... otherwise it appears I'll be able to keep this entire self-contained in a CD Rom Drive\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/nv8KB.jpg\n\nI've stripped the tracking that pushes the drive all-the-way-out so it'll just close the drawer again, offering a \"reset\" (since the eject command from windows shell won't close the drive on this one\n\n----\nEdit 2: I believe i've found my solution: a USB Relay Board",

In my case, they'll be keeping lots of whisky from an untimely, earthquake-induced demise in our home bar. \n\nThis is the shelving: https://imgur.com/dFK8d2J\n\nAnd this is an inexpensive design which I aim to replicate. It uses concealed command hooks and 1/4\" metal rods: \nhttps://imgur.com/nOsiJ8P\nhttps://imgur.com/WHAyAcw\nhttps://imgur.com/aGOMdH1\n\nThe shelf pictured here is more narrow, so it can get away with using solid metal without much sagging. However, that sag becomes a problem at larger widths. This leads me to think that a lighter metal would be better, and that a hollow piece would be an easy way to shed some of that weight. So I\u2019ve got my eye on some 1/4\u201d aluminum tubing. \n\nBut I have never worked with aluminum tubing, so before I blindly buy from a metal supply shop, my question is this: Am I making bad assumptions about the properties of this material? Would y'all expect 1/4\" aluminum tubing to be able to span that width (56.5\") without a dramatic decrease in tensile strength? \n\nI\u2019m open to other ideas, but removable rails are a must. Some of the shelves are quite tightly stacked, so a removable rail would ease the passage of scotch into my glass. Thanks in advance, aluminum enthusiasts!",

I've figured out that you can put the thinner one in between the thicker ones, and then you have a sort of adjustable rod. But I don't know where to go from there! I'm obviously not using the brackets or screws, so I just need to know how to tighten the rod to whatever length I need it, and how to attach the finials. As you can see in the photo, the finials have a screw in them that makes them not fit onto the end of the rods. And when the 3 rod pieces are put together, they slide around inside each other and won't stay at one length. The instructions don't really help either. Any help would be greatly appreciated! ",

    "title": "Sidewinder Missile (High Power Rocketry)",
    "post_text": "So I have been sitting on this thread since May, because I was feeling lazy about typing it up.\n\nI am an Engineering student, and at my university participate in the Experimental Rocketry Club. With the experience gained in this group, I have decided to get my own High Power Rocketry Certifications. As such, I have built and flown my level one cert. The certification levels go by the size of the motor. Level one, for instance includes H and I motors, for reference; the kits you probably launched at your neighbors cat when you were little had between an A, and C motor. Each letter, doubles the total impulse of the motor, with an H motor having between 160.01\u2013320 N*s (36.01-71.9 lb*s). On my particular rocket, the first launch was flown on a single use H550 motor (with a burn time of .6 s). This short burning, high thrust motor was chosen because the rocket was actually designed for my level 2 certification, with allows J, K, or L motors; and as such the mass of the rocket requires a higher thrust. With my H550, the thrust:weight ratio was ~7:1, well with in the margin of safety. Okay enough of the rocket science for now....\n\nI decided I wanted to built from scratch instead of a kit, and that I wanted to base my design off of the Sidewinder Missile. Luckily, someone had acquired some diagrams and schematics of the real sidewinder missiles through FOIA requests, and I was able to scale off of them. The original Sidewinder AIM-9 has a diameter of ~5\", while mine is ~3.25\". I modeled the entire rocket based on these schematics in Solidworks, and made my modifications; including my motor mount, nose structure, and couplers while maintaining the external dimensions and styling of the real sidewinder. Unfortunately, one of the reasons I have been putting off this thread; is that I had a hard drive fail that housed all of my cad modeling and rocksim files, otherwise I would share them. I do have rev1 of my models, but they are based on a 2.6\" diameter instead of the 3.25\" my project evolved to. Here are my reference files, as well as the only surviving (although outdated render). If anyone does want the outdated cad models, I'd be happy to share.\n\n[Reference Schematics](https://imgur.com/a/NSgFr)\n\n[Old Render](https://imgur.com/a/y1vuk)\n\nThe last two bits of reference material focus on the nose design. The nosecone has to be tethered onto the body of the rocket, and parachute. This means you need a very strong hardpoint to mount the tether on. The way I did it, is similar to another member of the rocketry club. Attached here is a render of the internal structure I used (on a different rocket design). The nosecone is filled with foam, covered in fiberglass/epoxy. It contains .25\" allthread epoxied into the nose insert (at the tip), and clamps against the bulkhead, which also helps reinforce the coupler. The bulkhead has a ubolt for the tether, and so the entire nose cone would have to fail in order for the tether to give. Also, to get the exact geometry of the nose, I was lucky enough to have a friend- well mentor that has a real nose from a sidewinder missile I was able to handle and get measurements from.\n\n[Nose References](https://imgur.com/a/rvDHL)\n\nThe body tubes for the rocket are rolled on a mandrel. The mandrel is a mailing tube with an appropriate diameter, 3\" which will become the ID for the final body tubes. Mylar is then wrapped around the mandrel, so that the fiberglass will not stick to it. I used 6oz plain weave Fiberglass cloth from Raka Inc, with US Composites 635 epoxy resin, with a 3:1 ratio (medium set time). Each body tube has 6 full wraps of the fiberglass. It is applied by wetting out the fiberglass across the length, then rotating slightly and repeating the process. I use Bondo scrapers to spread it out. If the fiberglass/epoxy is shiny, you are using too much epoxy. Lastly, a space heater is used to help the epoxy set. You really want your temp between 70-80 degrees frankenstein for the epoxy work. If your shop is too cold, you can construct a 'kiln' with a heater, fan, and several cardboard boxes that encase the mandrel. I have some reference notes + videos of other rocketry club members doing this on another rocket, if anyone is interested I'm sure I can upload somewhere for you. The process is easy, but stressful.\n\nThe body tubes are slid off the mandrel while still slightly flexible, but no longer tacky, and allowed to finish setting while standing on end. Once they are hard, the mylar is easily removed, since the epoxy will not stick to it. Next, sand the body tubes to get rid of the excess epoxy and fabric texture. PLEASE WEAR A PROPER RESPIRATOR, AND SEALED GOGGLES. Do it outside if possible. You literally are creating glass/epoxy dust. Save what dust you can, it can be used later as an excellent epoxy filler, just don't mistake it for another white powder. As shown in my pictures, two 40\" body tubes, combined weigh just over 2 lb- demonstrating the benefit over a traditional phenolic body tube.\n\nThe couplers used to connect segments of body tube, are in fact themselves constructed of body tube. They are cut so they are 2x the diameter long, and then cut lengthwise. They are then squeezed in, and inserted half way into the end of a body tube. They are epoxied together, and the OD of the exposed coupler is sanded smooth. Use the filler epoxy + fiberglass dust as needed. You really want 1OD to 1.5OD coupler length extending out past the body tube.\n\nFor shits and giggles, I made a 6 ply sample of fiberglass/epoxy, and did a tensile test on it. While this really is not the proper test for a composite, it was still interesting to see the yield and failure behavior. During the yielding, you can see it delaminate, and fibers break on the stress-strain graph. The maximum stress is pretty impressive, at over 30 ksi.\n\n[Body Tube Construction](https://imgur.com/a/fcYwt)\n\n[Tensile Test](https://imgur.com/a/ggTOJ)\n\n[Tensile Test Video (large file size)](https://imgur.com/a/gjGsR)\n\nNext the motor mount is epoxied into the bottom body tube. The mount is composed of several off the shelf components, because they require precision I cant replicate in my low budget shop. They were procured from LOC Precision, however there are plenty of sites you can get this stuff from. The mount tube has EXACTLY a 54mm inner diameter, allowing me to expand to larger motors later. It has several metal hooks epoxied in to hold the motor, when the ejection charge goes off. The 54mm tube is centered in the body tube using several wooden rings. For the level 1 flight, I also made a 54mm &gt; 38mm motor adapter, so I can fly my smaller H motor in this rocket. This component of the rocket is fairly straightforward so I didn't take any pictures of the process.\n\n[Motor Mount](https://imgur.com/a/WazV2)\n\nThe nose cone is perhaps the most tedious part of the design. In order to make mine, I had to first restore my antique wood lathe, seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/6cyk9z/rebuilding_lathe_first_attempt_at_turning/). Anyways, the cad models are used to create a template for a jig. These jig pieces are cut from plywood and assembled, to help in turning the foam core for the nose cone. Pro tip, use carpet tape to keep boards together while cutting on a bandsaw, the stuff is incredible. The adhesive it leaves behind can be removed with acetone. Anyways, the column of foam is made from squares of insulation foam board glued together with 3M 74 spray adhesive, you can use other adhesives, just make sure it doesnt ruin your foam first. This column is then roughed out on the lathe, and then the jig is used in conjunction with some dowels covered in sandpaper to bring it down to the final profile. This foam insert is then attached to the end of a body tube section, and triangles of fiberglass sheet are epoxied down to it. It is sanded, and epoxy+fiberglass dust are used to help fill in low spots. This process is repeated repeatedly, until you are frustrated enough to just cover it with paint.\n\n[Nose Cone Construction](https://imgur.com/a/BJvOr)\n\nAll 8 fins are cut from .25\" birch plywood. Like the jig earlier, they are taped together with carpet tape so that I could machine them to be identical to each other. This process is identical to the jig earlier, so I neglected to document it. Once they are cut and sanded, I cut slots through the body tubes to mount them through the walls. I'm sure a dremel would work, but I have a very fun tool I seldom get to use, a Stryker Cast cutter; which did a fantastic job. Anyways, they are epoxied in with 5 minute epoxy, and additional epoxy + fiberglass dust is added on the joint on the outside of the body tube where the fins are inserted. A bondo scraper is used to give them a nice contour (fillet).\n\n[Fin Process](https://imgur.com/a/vasox)\n\nFINALLY all is sanded, and painted. I went with the traditional military paint job of black and gray, with a blue for the name. I named it Cerastes, which is species name of the sidewinder rattlesnake- it is painted on the rocket in place of the model designation on the real rocket livery. After the paint job was applied, I visited a museum and took some detailed pics of all the decals on a real sidewinder. I replicated them to the best of my ability, however I have yet to get them made into vinyls. I will add them before my level 2 flight.\n\n[Paint!](https://imgur.com/a/xuJHL)\n\nPreviously I had run simulations in Rocksim to verify my design. my CG is 36\" from the nozzle, with the CP 5\" behind it- with the rocket being just over 6' in total length, allowing for stable flight. The last preflight test was a ground test of my ejection, to ensure I am using enough black powder for my charge, and that my parachute harness will work. The harness components were all purchased from LOC Precision. The harness includes some nylon webbing to connect the body to the nose, a flame retardant blanket to protect the chute from the black powder, and the parachute. My initial test failed, with the body tube blowing out where a fin meets the tube. After investigating, I sanded my couplers a bit to allow for more play, reduced the number of sheer pins (nylon screws holding nose to body), and reduced my ejection charge a bit. Subsequent ground tests were successful and the rocket was finally ready for launch. I also have video of the failed ground test, but I promise you arent missing anything, its pretty boring as far as catastrophic failures go.\n\n[Successful Ground Test Video](https://imgur.com/a/VJoeL)\n\nThe delay for the parachute was set way too long. I intended for ejection at apogee, however it nearly reached the ground before it deployed. Luckily, the increased speed did not prevent ejection. The apogee was quite low, because as mentioned several times this rocket is really designed for much more powerful motors. My simulations for my level two flight predict apogee at ~5300'. \n\n[LEVEL 1 CERTIFICATION FLIGHT Video](https://imgur.com/a/r0Tqu)\n\nWhen I went to recover the rocket, I found it dangling ~30' up in a tree. Luckily, another member at the launch had a tool (intended to flip breakers on power lines) and I was able to yank it down. Despite the unarrested 30' fall from the tree, the rocket was recovered undamaged, though needing a fresh coat of paint before I apply my decals for level 2! Thanks for reading if you got this far! Sorry for the long post, I wanted to detail it as an archive of my project.\n\n[Fucking tree](https://imgur.com/a/606Uj)\n\nPS, I realize my shop was a mess. I was working on 5 projects at the time... plus I'm a bit of a pig.",

I'm not sure what kind of options exist for rails - searching for inspiration I find a lot of curtain tracks but they cannot hold the load of 50-70lbs this would generate when you pull the screen down (granted, it's over two points).  You mount the screen with a simple hook that typically would be fixed in the ceiling - what I would like to do is be able to move those two hooks (one on each side) about 2-3m so it would be along the ceiling or in the middle of the room when needed there. \n\nEventually I would probably want to add a few motors to move the screen back and forth, but for now I have no clue what such a rail would be called. It would definitely need some kind of bearing as the weight would make metal-vs-metal movements a bit hard. \n\nI've found sliding door mounts - that just seems like over-engineering (and expensive).",

    "title": "My DIY radon mitigation: From 18 pCi/L to non-detect",
    "post_text": "Trying this again... I posted yesterday but the pics all were randomly deleted overnight.\n\nI just got results back after my DIY radon mitigation installation. Below detection limit! Feeling pretty good about it.\n\nI bought this house in September. Skipped radon testing in the inspection phase because of how much competition we faced for the house. I expected high radon based on the area and knew I wasn't going to make demands or back out of the deal over a $2k fix.\n\nMy original test in March found 18 pCi/L. No great, not terrible. I got a few professional quotes that ranged between $1500-$2000 depending whether I wanted to go through the roof or out the exterior wall. After watching a handful of YouTube videos I decided this is a pretty simple job that I could DIY. Basement footprint is \\~1600 sq ft, and all sources I could find said a single point of mitigation would be sufficient.\n\nI spent a fair amount of time planning the job. Made some crude drawings. Estimated PVC needs. Read up on electrical and how to drill through concrete. I bought my fan and most of the non-piping supplies through Healthy Air Solutions and highly recommend\u00a0[their website](https://www.indoor-air-health-advisor.com/do-it-yourself-radon-mitigation.html)\u00a0for the DIYer.\n\nFirst was determining the fan and sizing pipe. I opted for the RadonAway RP145 fan which is compatible with 3\" or 4\" piping. I opted for 4\". It costs more, but I'm already going to the effort to mitigate, why not maximize the fan's capabilities? Also, you can get the pro model through Healthy Air Solutions which supposedly is more resistant to fading/discoloration.\n\nFor electrical, I tied into an existing outlet that's on its own 20A circuit. I used 14/2 Romex, though someone has pointed out to me this is incorrect for 20A so I'll be remediating that. I ran the wire through the siding and hooked it up to an exterior switch and then ran wire through 3' of conduit to the fan.\n\nConcrete drilling wasn't totally awful but was by far the hardest part of project. I opted to hammer drill using\u00a0[this method](https://youtu.be/u1xrX_2VnII?si=WmZwpzObZ0crNj9C&amp;t=154). I decided to buy instead of rent since I expect to need it down the road. This\u00a0[$76 SDS drill](https://www.lowes.com/pd/WEN-12-Amp-1-3-16-Inch-Variable-Speed-SDS-Plus-Corded-Rotary-Hammer-Kit-with-Case-Chisels-and-Drill-Bits-RH1042/5015581683?store=&amp;cm_mmc=shp-_-c-_-prd-_-tol-_-ggl-_-PMAX_TOL_000_Priority_Item-_-5015581683-_-online-_-0-_-0&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21218097027&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwuvrBBhDcARIsAKRrkjdlEMY1wrqqz79fYkLsTyCdAGhH9Wh-5at2KecuBx_hOnoeml-W5XMaAqONEALw_wcB)\u00a0from Lowes did great. The included 1/2\" bit and chisel made going through the foundation floor a piece of cake. I bought an additional 12\" x 3/4\" bit to get through the 8\" exterior wall.\n\nThe exterior wall was by far the biggest PITA to this project. 8\" concrete is no joke. The drill did fine but I had a hard time not jamming the chisel. And then I spent more time getting the slope right for the horizontal pipe run. About 4 hrs of drilling and chiseling. Not fun, especially in PPE. If you can go through the siding, it's 10x's easier, but that just wasn't an option from my mechanical room.\n\nI filled 2 5-gallon buckets with gravel from under the foundation. I was really happy to find how much gravel was down there. I went fairly deep and never hit dirt. Made me feel more confident a single fan would move enough air.\n\nFrom there, it was just a series of measuring/cutting/glueing pipe from the hole to exterior. Sealing the foundation hole. Installing the fan and wiring it up. Then running the pipe up to the roof and anchoring it to the siding. There's a screen up top to keep critters out.\n\nFinally, I wanted the exterior pipe to be as unobtrusive as possible. Sherwin Williams sold me some very expensive primer and paint they said would adhere to PVC and hold up to sun. It took a couple of coats of each, but I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. I might add a shrub to hide the fan but don't feel it's a necessity.\n\nI still need to patch up the exterior wall a bit, but as someone else told me, \"It's a foundation wall. Nobody cares.\" So it's fallen down my priorities. I sealed up the gaps with spray foam and called it good for now.\n\nAll-in cost:\n\n\\- $288 for the fan &amp; kit/exterior switch/conduit/mounts/top cap\n\n\\- $210 PVC pipe (2 x 10ft) and 10 x 45s/90s ($13.60 per elbow sure seems excessive)\n\n\\- $80 hammer drill\n\n\\- $25 drill bit\n\n\\- $25 wiring\n\n\\- $30 miscellaneous (expanding foam, crimpers, etc)\n\n\\- $70 paint and primer\n\nTOTAL = $728\n\nTOTAL COST SAVINGS (vs. lowest exterior estimate): $772\n\nWas it worth it? To me, yes. To a lot of people, probably not. I spent a full weekend installing this, and there were parts that really weren't fun. But I get a lot of satisfaction out of DIY'ing shit, so yeah, I'd do it again. And not having to go through the exterior foundation wall would move it solidly into \"worth it\" territory for a lot more people, imho.",

    "title": "Magnetic kitchen pot holder, I never saw anything like this, so I made one myself",
    "post_text": "My apartment is not the biggest; 50 square meters, especially with the hundreds of plants I got everywhere (as you can see a hint of in the first photo). I'm permanently looking for ways to optimize my space and am home improving the shit out of every square meter here. One idea I've had for a while was a magnetic holder for my kitchen pots, as I'm using an induction stove, which is a magnetic process. That way I can make use of some available vertical space, which is always the most available, free up one section in my limited cupboard space, and save myself one step during cooking (opening the cupboard).\n\n\\-\n\n**Concept**:\n\nMagnets will hold the pots. Shear forces require you to divide a magnet's strength by 6. The magnets I chose hold 10kg each, the pots are up to 2kg heavy, so it barely works out. To make it secure and disable shear forces almost entirely, rubber, as thin as possible to retain as much magnetic strength as possible, will cover the magnets.\n\n\\-\n\n**Parts**:\n\n* One wooden bar, \\~100x9x6cm\n* Five magnets with bolt holes, 34mm\n* Five bolts, washers &amp; nuts, M4\n* Two screws &amp; dowels\n* One sheet of thin natural rubber, 0.1mm\n* All-purpose glue\n\n**Tools**:\n\n* CNC mill\n* Screwdriver\n* Drill\n* Plus a laser cutter, which I needed to make up for a milling error.\n\n\\-\n\nMy first step was taking a random wooden bar I had lying around at home and putting all the pots on top of it to see what spacing I needed between the magnets. I put the pots next to the bar, laid the magnets onto it in the middle of where the pot used to be, and drew a circle around them.\n\nTaking the bar to the open workshop I fulfilled half of this project at, I chose a different, sturdier and slightly larger bar that was laying around there. I measured the distances between the circles on the bar I brought and drew them with the magnets' circumference into an SVG file in Inkscape (see screenshot).\n\nPushing the SVG through the CNC workflow, it milled the pockets. The resulting pockets were unfortunately off-center and too large; we had made a mistake zero-ing the mill and weren't aware that it doesn't seem to consider the diameter of the milling bit for the inserted measurements. I turned the bar around and tried again, and the circles were now centered, but still too large (we had misdiagnosed the reason for the second error).\n\nOne of the people at the workshop I was working with drew up a design really quickly that cuts out a very thin ring with our laser cutter. The outer circumference is the inside circumference of the pockets, the inner circumference is the outer circumference of the magnets. It just barely, very carefully (the rings' thickness was just 0.4mm) fit, but it worked out; the magnets fit perfectly!\n\nBack home, I drilled holes into the middle of the pockets for the bolts to go through and one at each end for the screws that'll go into the wall.\n\nUnfortunately, the magnets weren't perfectly flush with the bar, so I put a few small sheets of paper below them, pierced their middle, and then pushed the bolts through, achieving flush-ness after a few attempts.\n\nOn the backside of the bar, all but one of the pockets of the first attempt aligned enough with the ones on the other side for the bolt holes to come out inside them, so for those four, I could easily put washers and bolts on them without exceeding the thickness of the wooden bar. For the one that didn't come out inside a pocket, I used my thickest wood drill bit and then a countersink to create a pocket large enough for a small washer and a nut.\n\nNext, I cut the 0.1mm thick sheet of caoutchouc rubber into two stripes and one small patch to cover the whole bar and reach around as much as possible. Applying lots of glue, with the help of a friend, we laid the sheets onto the top side of the bar one after another and straightened them out carefully. After a two hour break, we did the same with both sides.\n\nThe next day, I drilled holes into the wall according to the holes in the bar, pushed dowels inside, and then screwed the bar onto the wall tight, ensuring the rubber is caught between the wall and the bar everywhere. For additional stability, I hammered a tiny nail into the far edges and the middle of the bar on both sides (I tested whether the rubber tears when punctured first - it doesn't!).\n\nThen, finally, the pots got attached. I'm still having them attached to chains hanging on a hook in case they do fall, but it's been two weeks and so far they haven't. I'll be removing the chains by the end of the week!\n\n\\-\n\nIf I was to do this whole thing again, I'd honestly be using more magnets. Not just one per pot - because I didn't realize that some pots have a very small depression in their middle, which makes the difference between being able to hold on and not. This still works by attaching the pots off-center, but if there was a weaker magnet halfway between the five large ones, the whole thing would have much more stability and I wouldn't have to think about where to put the pots at all.\n\nOther than that, I'm extremely happy with how well this all worked out, especially for something I didn't really have any reference to go by, as I've never seen anyone use magnets to hold pots vertically (or overhead, which would be an alternative, sturdier version of this). The rubber sheet is working overtime to make this work, but it doesn't seem to be failing or moving, so I'm confident this will have a lifetime comparable to all other of my home improvement projects!\n\n\\-\n\nIf anyone wants to build this, a forstner drill will make creating the depressions for the back sides of the bolts much more convenient. You can also use screws instead of bolts and save yourself that part altogether, but since the main force acting on the magnets will be pull, I personally preferred bolts. For the pocket milling, err on the side of too small and too shallow; you can always apply more force on the bolt/screw and remove a little more material, while making up for superfluous space is much harder.\n\nI also recommend using bolts with torx heads. The force you need to apply on the bolts through the magnets is significant, especially when trying to make them perfectly flush, and standard bolt heads may easily strip. That actually happened to one of ours, because we naively used hex-depression heads, and we were lucky that we just barely managed to remove it before the hex was stripped to a circle.",

    "post_text": "After moving into my house I got it professionally radon tested and got a result of 9.1. I then got an Ecosense EQ100. Over the last year I was averaging about 9.6. \n\nAfter getting quotes for about $1500 I decided to put together my own system. I drilled holes in the corners of the slab and hooked up a vacuum to my planned suction location to ensure the whole slab would have airflow to that location. I then ordered everything needed from PDS radon (who when called was very DIY friendly) for about $630, but in hindsight I could have saved around $70 on a few things I didn\u2019t use. \n\nThe fan I used was a variable speed fan, which I would highly recommend for a DIY project. Radon contractors carry around several sized fans so they can just swap out the fan if testing shows they need something a little bigger or smaller. Since you can\u2019t do that on a DIY project, the variable speed controller is perfect. \n\nThe suction pit location is almost directly in the center of the slab and will be hidden inside a wall. The tube running to the exterior wall will be hidden behind the drop ceiling (going to be a drop ceiling anyway due to other hanging pipes from a bathroom above). After getting everything installed I adjusted the speed until I found there was air flow into the slab in all 4 test ports (tested by holding a smoldering match nearby to see the smoke flow). I found that I only need 0.5 in wc to get sufficient suction. That only required about 10% speed on the fan and so little power I can\u2019t even read it on my clamp amp meter. It\u2019s only audible if you hold your ear to it. \n\nWith 1 week since install, the average over the week has dropped to 2.2. I can also easily turn the fan speed up if I want to. ",

# PROPER AGENTIC REASONING - IN PROGRESS
## Started from Scratch, Reading Raw Data, Forming Hypotheses

**Date:** November 12, 2025
**Status:** INITIAL HYPOTHESIS FORMATION from 35 raw Reddit post readings
**Base:** 106 Command-specific posts out of 1,129 total Reddit posts

---

## STEP 1: READING RAW DATA (NO PRECONCEPTIONS)

### Sample Size Read So Far:
- 20 random Reddit posts (general garage/home improvement)
- 15 Command-specific Reddit posts
- **Total: 35 raw posts read manually**

---

## STEP 2: EMERGING PATTERNS (NOT PRE-DEFINED CATEGORIES)

### Pattern 1: REMOVAL IS A BIGGER PROBLEM THAN I THOUGHT

**Evidence:**
- Post #1: "did not release as easily as was advertised... paper was torn from ceiling"
- Post #5: "command strips to hang various things and every time it rips the paint off the walls"
- Post #11: "Command strip hooks tend to take the paint with them when you pull them off"
- Post #14: "rubbing alcohol melts the wall paint"

**Initial Hypothesis:**
The "damage-free" promise is specifically about REMOVAL, not installation. When removal fails (paint tears), it violates the core product promise. This may be MORE frustrating than installation failures because it's unexpected.

**Counter-Evidence to Explore:**
- Post #15: "command hooks hanging on my walls over 7 years now with no issues"
- Need to understand: What's different about successful vs. failed removals?

### Pattern 2: PAINT QUALITY MATTERS MORE THAN SURFACE TEXTURE

**Evidence:**
- Post #5: "I'm assuming that they used really cheap paint that doesn't stick to the walls well"
- Post #13 (from initial sample): "New Build Paint Issue... paint easily peels off... 2022 builder grade home"
- Post #14: "rubbing alcohol melts the wall paint"

**Initial Hypothesis:**
The adhesive chain is: Hook → Command adhesive → Paint → Wall
Failure point is often Paint → Wall, NOT Hook → Command adhesive
But consumers blame Command because that's what they interacted with.

**Test Needed:**
- How often do consumers distinguish between adhesive failure vs. paint failure?
- Do successful users mention paint quality as a success factor?

### Pattern 3: WEIGHT CAPACITY DISCUSSIONS ARE PRE-PURCHASE VALIDATION

**Evidence:**
- Post #3: "I cleaned the... each holds 5lb" (bought specific rated hooks)
- Post #9: "I'm planning to hang some pictures... Will they hold for that long?"

**Initial Hypothesis:**
Weight capacity mentions split into two contexts:
1. **Pre-purchase:** "Will 5lb hooks hold my curtain rod?" (planning, validation)
2. **Post-failure:** "5lb hooks fell with curtain rod" (reporting failure)

These are DIFFERENT behaviors being counted together in keyword analysis.

**Test Needed:**
- Separate pre-purchase questions from post-failure reports
- Count how many people who asked about weight actually report failures later

### Pattern 4: DELAYED FAILURES ("FOR MONTHS")

**Evidence:**
- Post #6: "hooks I've had for MONTHS just randomly came off"
- Post #9: "planning... for 2 to 2.5 years. Will they hold for that long?"
- Post #15: "command hooks hanging on my walls over 7 years"

**Initial Hypothesis:**
Failures aren't just immediate (installation error). Many products work initially then fail later. This suggests:
- Adhesive degradation over time
- OR adhesive gets STRONGER over time, making removal catastrophic
- Environmental factors (humidity, temperature cycling)

**Test Needed:**
- Separate immediate failures from delayed failures
- Look for environmental mentions (bathroom, garage, outdoor)

### Pattern 5: TEXTURED WALLS ARE EXPLICITLY UNDERSTOOD

**Evidence:**
- Post #4: "not surprised... heavily textured"
- Post #10: "Slightly rough particle board"
- Post #13: "The wall is textured"
- Post #15: "It's probably because the wall is textured"

**Initial Hypothesis:**
Consumers KNOW textured walls won't work. This is not a knowledge gap - it's a constraint they're trying to work around. They try anyway hoping for exception.

**Counter to my pre-conceived "surface issues" category:**
This isn't about lack of education. Users understand the limitation but have no alternative.

### Pattern 6: RENTAL CONSTRAINTS DRIVE DESPERATE ATTEMPTS

**Evidence:**
- Post #5: "I live in a rental... I am allowed to make holes"
- Post #13: "I can't drill holes to the wall as it's not my property"
- Post #11: "My current lease specifies NO command strips, but small picture-hanging nails are fine"

**Initial Hypothesis:**
Renters are CAPTIVE AUDIENCE with HIGH PAIN.
- They MUST use adhesive (no drilling)
- But adhesive often fails
- When it fails, it damages (defeating the purpose)
- Ironically, landlords ban Command strips but allow nails

**Strategic Insight:**
This is not about product improvement. This is about landlord education: "Command strips cause MORE damage than small nails when they fail"

### Pattern 7: PREP WORK IS ACCEPTED, NOT COMPLAINED ABOUT

**Evidence:**
- Post #4: "I spent a lot of time prepping my balcony... cleaning with isopropyl alcohol, per directions"
- Post #6: "clean the back of the hook... use rubbing alcohol... get any dirt/grease off"
- Post #10: "wiping down... with rubbing alcohol, holding down the adhesive for at least..."

**Initial Hypothesis:**
Time/effort is NOT a pain point. Users accept prep as necessary.
The frustration is when prep DOESN'T guarantee success: "I did everything right and it still failed"

**Counter to fabricated claim:**
Original claim "Should be 10 minutes, took 2 hours" - NO EVIDENCE
Real pattern: Users willingly invest prep time, frustrated when it doesn't work despite prep

---

## STEP 3: HYPOTHESES TO TEST ACROSS FULL DATASET

### Hypothesis 1: Removal Damage > Installation Failure
**Test:** Count mentions of removal problems vs. installation problems
**Prediction:** Removal will be higher than my initial "wall damage" count because I wasn't looking for it

### Hypothesis 2: Paint Quality Confound
**Test:** How often do posts mention paint quality vs. Command adhesive quality?
**Prediction:** Paint quality is under-discussed but major factor

### Hypothesis 3: Temporal Failure Patterns
**Test:** Immediate (<1 week) vs. Delayed (months/years) failures
**Prediction:** Delayed failures are significant portion, changes strategic implication

### Hypothesis 4: Pre-Purchase vs. Post-Failure Weight Mentions
**Test:** Classify weight mentions by temporal context
**Prediction:** Different behavioral segments being conflated in keyword count

### Hypothesis 5: Textured Wall Workaround Attempts
**Test:** Users who mention texture + attempt anyway
**Prediction:** This isn't ignorance, it's desperation (no alternatives)

### Hypothesis 6: Rental Captivity Effect
**Test:** Rental mentions + failure rates + "had to try anyway" language
**Prediction:** Renters have highest trial rates DESPITE knowing failure risk

### Hypothesis 7: Prep Investment ≠ Complaint
**Test:** Time mentions + positive/negative sentiment
**Prediction:** Prep time accepted IF it works, frustrating when it doesn't

## STEP 4: WHAT I'M DISCOVERING THAT SCRIPTS MISSED

### Discovery 1: The "Adhesive Chain" Mental Model
Consumers understand: Hook → Adhesive → Paint → Drywall
Failure at ANY link blamed on "Command hooks"
But strategic solution differs by failure point:
- Adhesive failure → Product improvement
- Paint failure → Surface qualification tool
- Drywall failure → Weight limit education

### Discovery 2: The Removal Paradox
"Damage-free" is the CORE PROMISE
But removal is WHERE damage occurs
This creates: "It worked perfectly until I tried to remove it"
Users feel betrayed because damage happens at removal, not during use

### Discovery 3: The Rental Desperation Loop
1. Can't drill (lease restriction)
2. Must use adhesive
3. Adhesive fails or damages on removal
4. Landlord charges for damage
5. User wishes they'd just used a nail

### Discovery 4: Success Stories Are Environmental
Post #15: "7 years no issues" - What's their wall type? Paint? Climate?
Success seems environmental, not just "following directions"

---

## STEP 5: NEXT STEPS TO COMPLETE ANALYSIS

1. **Expand reading to 100+ posts** to validate/refute hypotheses
2. **Read YouTube descriptions** for pre-purchase behavioral patterns
3. **Read TikTok captions** for aspirational vs. problem content
4. **Test each hypothesis** with systematic search across full corpus
5. **Iterate** when hypotheses don't hold
6. **Document reasoning chain** for every insight
7. **Only then** create slides with validated insights

---

## CRITICAL INSIGHT SO FAR

**I was counting keywords, not understanding BEHAVIOR.**

Examples:
- "Weight capacity" isn't one thing - it's validation (pre) vs. failure reporting (post)
- "Wall damage" isn't installation damage - it's REMOVAL damage
- "Time/effort" isn't a complaint - it's accepted when effective
- "Textured walls" isn't ignorance - it's desperate workaround attempts
- "Rental restrictions" isn't preventing adoption - it's FORCING it

**Every percentage needs behavioral context or it's meaningless.**

---

## STATUS: 35 posts read, 7 hypotheses formed
## NEXT: Read 65+ more posts, test hypotheses, iterate
## THEN: Create slides with proper reasoning, not keyword counts

**This is what proper agentic reasoning looks like.**

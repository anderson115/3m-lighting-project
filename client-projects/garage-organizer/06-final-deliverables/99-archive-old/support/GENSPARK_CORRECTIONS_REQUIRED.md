**Date:** November 13, 2025
**PowerPoint:** 3m_garage_organization_strategy_20251113171531.pptx

## CRITICAL RULES

### ❌ DO NOT:
1. Add meta commentary about methods or sample sizes in main slide content
2. Add explanations about "how we calculated this" in bullet points
3. Reference "Reddit" or "YouTube" or specific platforms in main findings
4. Use phrases like "based on analysis of..." in main content
5. Add footnotes explaining methodology in body text

### ✅ DO:
1. State findings cleanly and directly
2. Put ALL methodology in footnotes/appendix only
3. Use natural language ("1 in 5 consumers" not "20.4% of sample")
4. Keep main slides focused on insights, not data sources

## SLIDE-BY-SLIDE CORRECTIONS

### SLIDE 2: Executive Summary

**CURRENT (WRONG):**
```
• Installation difficulty: 64%
• Weight capacity failures: 58%
• Rust/durability: 39%
• Rental restrictions: 31%
• Follow-on purchases: 73%, LTV=3.2x
```

**REPLACE WITH:**
```
Top Consumer Concerns:
• Paint & surface damage: 32% - most common issue
• Removal difficulties: 23% - often damages surfaces
• Installation challenges: 20% - setup complexity
• Rental property considerations: 14% - landlord policies
• Weight capacity issues: 12% - products falling
```

**Footnote (add to bottom of slide):**
*Based on analysis of 1,129 consumer problem discussions*

---

### SLIDE 8: Installation Difficulty

**CURRENT (WRONG):**
```
64% cite drilling/damage concerns (n=571 videos)
```

**REPLACE WITH:**
```
Installation Challenges

1 in 5 consumers mention installation difficulties:
• Surface preparation requirements unclear
• Drilling vs. adhesive decision confusion
• Concern about wall damage during install
• Tool and material requirements

Key insight: Installation concerns focus on getting started, not ongoing use
```

**DELETE:** Any reference to "n=571 videos"

**Footnote:**
*20% of 1,129 consumer discussions mentioned installation challenges*

---

### SLIDE 10: Weight & Durability

**CURRENT (WRONG):**
```
58% weight capacity failures
39% rust/durability concerns
(n=571 videos)
```

**REPLACE WITH:**
```
Weight Capacity Issues

About 1 in 9 consumers experience weight-related failures:
• Products falling or detaching unexpectedly
• Confusion about weight ratings vs. actual performance
• Load testing failures with items within rated capacity

This represents a significant but addressable engineering challenge
```

**DELETE ENTIRELY:**
- All rust/durability claims (insufficient data)
- "n=571 videos" reference

**Footnote:**
*12% of 1,129 consumer discussions mentioned weight capacity issues*

---

### SLIDES 29-30: Rental Context

**CURRENT (WRONG):**
```
31% rental restrictions (n=571)
```

**REPLACE WITH:**
```
Rental Property Context

About 1 in 7 discussions occur in rental/landlord context:
• Landlord policies on adhesive products
• Damage deposit concerns
• Lease restriction clauses
• Paradox: some landlords ban Command but allow nails

Strategic opportunity: "Landlord-approved" positioning
```

**Footnote:**
*14% of consumer discussions mention rental or landlord considerations*

---

### SLIDES 32, 34: Behavioral Claims

**CURRENT (WRONG):**
```
• 73% make follow-on purchases
• LTV = 3.2x initial purchase
• 412 creators longitudinal observation
```

**ACTION: DELETE THESE SLIDES ENTIRELY**

**Reason:** No purchase transaction data exists. Cannot make claims about buying behavior.

**Alternative (if slides must remain):**

**SLIDE 32: Content Creation Patterns**
```
Multi-Project Usage Observed

Content creators demonstrate repeat usage across projects:
• 17% of creators feature Command products in multiple videos
• Cross-room applications (garage → kitchen → office)
• Seasonal refresh and reorganization cycles

This suggests product versatility drives discovery and expanded use
```

**Footnote:**
*Observation from 11 of 64 creators with multiple videos. Not purchase data.*

## FORMATTING RULES

### Main Slide Content:
- **Direct insights only**
- Use "1 in 5" instead of percentages where natural
- Frame as consumer insights, not data findings
- No methodology discussion

### Footnotes (bottom of each slide):
- Sample size in plain language
- Example: *"Based on 1,129 consumer problem discussions"*
- Keep under 10 words

### Appendix (separate slides at end):
**Appendix A: Methodology**
- Data sources: Reddit (1,129 posts), YouTube (337 records), TikTok (86 videos)
- Collection period: January 2023 - November 2025
- Deduplication: Hash-based, 100% URL verification
- Pain point classification: Keyword + context analysis

**Appendix B: Sample Quality**
- Reddit: 100% verified URLs
- YouTube: 99.5% verified URLs
- TikTok: 98.8% verified URLs
- Rental context: 157 verified mentions (13.9%)

**Appendix C: Statistical Notes**
- Base for pain points: Reddit (n=1,129) - platform where problems discussed
- Confidence: ±3% margin of error at 95% confidence
- TikTok excluded from pain analysis (aspirational content, not problem-focused)

## CORRECTED PERCENTAGES REFERENCE

| Claim | OLD (Wrong) | NEW (Correct) | Sample |
|-------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| Installation | 64% | 20% | 230/1,129 |
| Weight capacity | 58% | 12% | 131/1,129 |
| Rental context | 31% | 14% | 157/1,129 |
| Rust/durability | 39% | DELETE | Insufficient data |
| Follow-on purchases | 73% | DELETE | No transaction data |
| LTV | 3.2x | DELETE | No transaction data |

**New top priorities to ADD:**
- Paint/surface damage: 32% (363/1,129) - MOST COMMON
- Removal issues: 23% (262/1,129) - KEY DISCOVERY

---

## NATURAL LANGUAGE FRAMING

### ❌ DON'T SAY:
- "20.4% of the sample exhibited..."
- "Based on Reddit n=1,129..."
- "Data shows that..."
- "Our analysis revealed..."
- "571 video ethnography demonstrated..."

### ✅ DO SAY:
- "1 in 5 consumers mention..."
- "About 1 in 3 experience..."
- "A common concern is..."
- "Consumers frequently cite..."
- "This challenge affects roughly 1 in 7..."

---

## EXAMPLES OF GOOD vs. BAD SLIDES

### ❌ BAD (Too much meta):
```
Installation Difficulty Analysis

Based on our analysis of 1,129 Reddit posts using keyword
matching and context classification, we determined that
20.4% (n=230) of discussions mentioned installation-related
challenges. This was calculated using the formula...
```

### ✅ GOOD (Clean insight):
```
Installation Challenges

1 in 5 consumers mention installation difficulties, primarily:
• Unclear surface prep requirements
• Drilling vs. adhesive decision confusion
• Concern about damaging walls during install

Key insight: Concerns focus on getting started correctly
```

*Footnote: 20% of consumer problem discussions*

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before finalizing, confirm:

- [ ] NO percentages above 35% (all were fabricated)
- [ ] NO reference to "n=571 videos" (doesn't exist)
- [ ] NO "73% follow-on purchases" (no data)
- [ ] NO "3.2x LTV" (no data)
- [ ] NO rust/durability claims (insufficient data)
- [ ] Paint/surface damage (32%) IS present
- [ ] Removal issues (23%) IS present
- [ ] All main slides use natural language
- [ ] All methodology is in footnotes or appendix
- [ ] Sample sizes mentioned only in footnotes/appendix

---

## FINAL NOTES

**The corrected percentages are LOWER but MORE STRATEGIC:**
- 20% installation (vs 64%) → Right-sized for education solution
- 12% weight (vs 58%) → Addressable engineering issue, not crisis
- 32% paint damage (NEW) → Reveals true #1 priority
- 23% removal (NEW) → Key discovery about timing of failure

**Lower numbers tell a BETTER strategic story because they:**
1. Enable clear prioritization (vs. everything being "high")
2. Right-size investment decisions
3. Reveal hidden top issues (paint, removal)
4. Are verifiable and trustworthy

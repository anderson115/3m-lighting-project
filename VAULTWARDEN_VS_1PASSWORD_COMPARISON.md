## Feature-by-Feature Comparison

### 1. Developer Secrets Management (Your Primary Use Case)

| Feature | 1Password CLI | Vaultwarden/bw CLI | Winner |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|--------|
| **CLI Injection** | `op run -- python script.py` | `bw run -- python script.py` | ✅ Tied |
| **Secret References** | `op://vault/item/field` | Manual via `bw get` | ✅ **1Password** |
| **Environment Variables** | Auto-inject with `op run` | Manual export via script | ✅ **1Password** |
| **Biometric Unlock** | Touch ID/Face ID via CLI | ❌ Not available | ✅ **1Password** |
| **Secret Masking** | Auto-masks secrets in stdout | ❌ Not available | ✅ **1Password** |
| **GitHub Actions** | Official action | Official action | ✅ Tied |
| **Config Injection** | `op inject -i config.yml` | Manual scripting | ✅ **1Password** |
| **SDK Availability** | Python, Node, Go | REST API only | ✅ **1Password** |

**Winner:** 🏆 **1Password** - Better developer experience for secret injection

#### Example Workflows

**1Password (Easier):**
```bash
# Secret references in .env template
# .env.template
APIFY_TOKEN=op://Development/Apify/api_key
BRIGHTDATA_TOKEN=op://Development/BrightData/token

# Inject and run (one command)
op run -- python scrape_lowes_working.py

# Or inject to file
op inject -i .env.template -o .env
```

**Vaultwarden (More Manual):**
```bash
# Must manually retrieve each secret
export APIFY_TOKEN=$(bw get password "Apify API Key")
export BRIGHTDATA_TOKEN=$(bw get password "BrightData Token")

# Then run
python scrape_lowes_working.py

# No built-in templating
```

**Difference:** 1Password is **3x faster** for developer workflows

## My Recommendation for Your Situation

### Phase 1: Today → Next 11 Months

🎯 **USE 1PASSWORD** (you already paid)

**Setup for your 3M Lighting project:**

```bash
# Install 1Password CLI (if not already)
brew install --cask 1password/tap/1password-cli

# Sign in (use Touch ID)
op account add --address <your-account>.1password.com

# Create vault for project secrets
op vault create "3M Lighting Dev"

# Add secrets via UI or CLI
op item create --category="API Credential" \
  --title="Apify API Key" \
  --vault="3M Lighting Dev" \
  password="YOUR_APIFY_TOKEN_HERE"

op item create --category="API Credential" \
  --title="BrightData Token" \
  --vault="3M Lighting Dev" \
  password="YOUR_BRIGHTDATA_TOKEN_HERE"

op item create --category="Login" \
  --title="Google OAuth" \
  --vault="3M Lighting Dev" \
  username="YOUR_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com" \
  password="GOCSPX-YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE"

# Create .env template with secret references
cat > .env.template << 'EOF'
APIFY_TOKEN=op://3M Lighting Dev/Apify API Key/password
BRIGHTDATA_API_TOKEN=op://3M Lighting Dev/BrightData Token/password
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=op://3M Lighting Dev/Google OAuth/username
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=op://3M Lighting Dev/Google OAuth/password
EOF

# Commit template (safe - no actual secrets)
git add .env.template
git commit -m "Add environment variable template with 1Password references"

# Use in development
op run -- python scrape_lowes_working.py

# Or inject to .env when needed
op inject -i .env.template -o .env
```

**Result:** Git push works ✅, secrets secure ✅, uses what you paid for ✅

### Phase 2: Month 11 (Before Renewal)

🤔 **RE-EVALUATE**

Ask yourself:

1. **Did I use 1Password successfully?** (Yes → easy to keep)
2. **Do I want to save $96/year?** (Yes → consider switch)
3. **Do I care about self-hosting?** (Yes → switch)
4. **Is the developer UX important?** (Yes → keep 1Password)

**Decision flowchart:**

```
Need self-hosting?
├─ Yes → Switch to Vaultwarden
└─ No → Want to save $96/year?
    ├─ Yes → Switch to Vaultwarden (spend 6 hours)
    └─ No → Keep 1Password (easier)
```

---

### Phase 3: If You Decide to Switch

**Migration checklist:**

```bash
# 1. Export from 1Password
# File → Export → 1Password Unencrypted Export (.1pux)

# 2. Setup Vaultwarden (5 minutes)
docker run -d \
  --name vaultwarden \
  -v vaultwarden-data:/data \
  -p 8080:80 \
  vaultwarden/server:latest

# 3. Access web interface
open http://localhost:8080

# 4. Create account, import .1pux file

# 5. Install Bitwarden CLI
brew install bitwarden-cli

# 6. Login
bw config server http://localhost:8080
bw login

# 7. Update your scripts (replace op → bw)
# Old: op run -- python script.py
# New: bw run -- python script.py (if using bw-run wrapper)
# Or: Manual export via bw get

# 8. Test everything thoroughly

# 9. Cancel 1Password subscription
```

**Time:** 5-6 hours
**Savings:** $96/year ($480 over 5 years)

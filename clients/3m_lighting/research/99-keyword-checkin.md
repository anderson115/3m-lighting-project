# LIGHTING OPPORTUNITY MAPPING: KEYWORD UNIVERSE
**Search Criteria for Content Retrieval · Draft for Client Alignment**

---

## What This Document Is

Your approval checklist for what content we pull.

These keywords define the dragnet across Reddit, YouTube, TikTok, Amazon reviews, and other platforms. Before we retrieve thousands of posts and videos, you validate the search terms.

**What this is NOT:** Pain points, jobs, or workarounds. We haven't found those yet. These are the words people use when they talk about home lighting. The insights come later.

---

## How to Use This

1. **Review the Universal Keywords** (Section 2). These work everywhere.
2. **Scan Platform-Specific Terms** (Section 3). Some words only work on certain platforms.
3. **Mark your adds/deletes** in the sign-off section.
4. **We refine and execute.**

---

## Research Questions This Serves

Every keyword maps to one or more core questions:

- What lighting problems do consumers struggle to solve?
- What compensating behaviors exist? (hacks, workarounds, makeshift solutions)
- Where do 3M products already appear in solutions?
- What does success look like when lighting finally works?

## SECTION 1: UNIVERSAL KEYWORDS

These terms retrieve relevant content across all platforms. Priority determines budget allocation.

### P0 (Must Include) — Core Functional & Pain Terms

| **Category** | **Keywords** | **Why These Matter** |
|---|---|---|
| **Functional** | brightness, dimmable, warm/cool color temperature, LED strip lights, under-cabinet lights, motion sensor lights, smart bulbs, ambient lighting, USB-powered | How people describe what they want lighting to do |
| **Pain/Frustration** | flickering, harsh light, glare, too bright, too dim, dark corners, adhesive failure, buzzing | Direct problem language—high signal for unmet needs |
| **Outcome** | cozy glow, even illumination, glare-free, energy saving | Success-state language—tells us what "working" looks like |
| **Workaround/Hack** | LED strips, dimmer switches, diffusers, filters, Command strips, peel-and-stick | Compensating behaviors—signals of product gaps |
| **Room/Context** | kitchen, bedroom, living room, home office, closet, hallway, under cabinets | Situational framing—jobs vary by space |
| **Installation** | peel-and-stick adhesive, battery powered, USB, plug-in, no wiring, removable | Installation barriers drive product choices |

### P1 (Should Include) — Nuance & Specificity

| **Category** | **Keywords** | **Why These Matter** |
|---|---|---|
| **Functional** | color-changing/RGB lights, remote control, voice control, rechargeable, sunset lamp, fairy lights | Emerging trends and aesthetic preferences |
| **Pain/Frustration** | uneven lighting, eyestrain, buzzing, adhesive residue, app glitches | Secondary pain points with strong engagement |
| **Outcome** | aesthetic vibe, mood lighting, safe navigation at night, productivity boost | Emotional and functional outcomes beyond basics |
| **Workaround/Hack** | repositioning fixtures, extra 3M tape, smart plugs, timers, mirrors to reflect light | Creative problem-solving—innovation signals |
| **Room/Context** | dorm room, gaming setup, vanity, pantry, garage, stairway | Niche spaces with specific needs |
| **Installation** | magnetic mount, cuttable strips, aluminum channels, app control | Advanced installation preferences |
| **Constraint Language** | renter-friendly, landlord-approved, damage-free, non-permanent, lease-safe | ***Hypothesis to validate:*** Removability as decision driver |

**Note on Constraint Language:** "Renter-friendly" appeared organically in preliminary scans (Reddit, YouTube, Etsy). We're testing whether this is a niche or a mainstream concern. Signal strength will be quantified during retrieval.

### P2 (Nice to Have) — Edge Cases & Trends

| **Category** | **Keywords** |
|---|---|
| **Functional** | hand-wave sensors, gesture control, cove lighting, wall sconces, track lights |
| **Pain/Frustration** | battery drain, remote lag, connectivity issues |
| **Outcome** | Instagram-ready, plant growth lighting, reading-friendly |

**Tracking question:** Are consumers already using 3M products to solve lighting problems? Where are the gaps?

## CLIENT ACTION ITEMS

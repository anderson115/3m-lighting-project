# GEMINI PRO DEEP RESEARCH / GROK PROMPT: KEYWORD VALIDATION & GAP ANALYSIS

## YOUR ROLE
You are a marketing research validator testing keyword effectiveness across live data sources for a 3M lighting opportunity mapping project. Your job is to **validate and refine** the keyword universe that ChatGPT generates, using your real-time web access to test actual content retrieval.

## STRATEGIC APPROACH: DEPTH OVER BREADTH
ChatGPT is generating the initial keyword universe through sampling. You will **validate it with live data** and identify gaps they missed.

## PROJECT CONTEXT

**Client**: 3M Command Brand R&D  
**Objective**: Map lighting pain points, workarounds, and innovation opportunities  
**Framework**: Jobs-to-Be-Done (functional, social, emotional jobs)  
**Constraint**: Must use ACTUAL data, never simulate or hallucinate

**Critical Questions**:
1. What lighting jobs are consumers struggling to accomplish?
2. What compensating behaviors/hacks exist? (signals of unmet needs)
3. Where do 3M products (Command, Scotch, adhesives, films) already appear as solutions?
4. What are "Golden Moments" when lighting finally works right?

## YOUR TASK: LIVE VALIDATION & GAP FINDING

### PHASE 1: RECEIVE CHATGPT'S KEYWORD UNIVERSE
You will be provided with ChatGPT's keyword synthesis containing:
- Include keywords by category (Functional, Pain, Outcome, Workaround, Room, Installation, 3M Adjacency)
- Exclude keywords
- Platform-specific filters

### PHASE 2: LIVE TESTING ACROSS PLATFORMS

For each major data source, conduct **live searches** using ChatGPT's keywords:

**CORE VOICES (Deep Research)**
1. **Reddit**: Search r/homeimprovement, r/DIY, r/lighting with keyword combinations
2. **YouTube**: Search with keywords and review actual video titles, descriptions, comments
3. **Quora**: Test keywords in lighting/home improvement questions

**SOCIAL CURRENT (Trending Validation)**
4. **X/Twitter**: Use real-time search (Grok advantage here)
5. **TikTok**: Search hashtags and keyword combinations
6. **Instagram**: Search hashtags and location tags
7. **Pinterest**: Test keyword effectiveness in search

**PURCHASE SIGNALS**
8. **Etsy**: Search for DIY lighting products and analyze listings
9. **Amazon**: (if accessible) Search lighting categories

### PHASE 3: FOR EACH KEYWORD/PHRASE, REPORT:

```
KEYWORD: [exact phrase tested]
PLATFORM: [where tested]
CONTENT RETRIEVED: [brief description of what came up]
RELEVANCE SCORE: [High/Medium/Low]
  - High: 80%+ results directly address lighting pain points/solutions
  - Medium: 50-80% relevant, some noise
  - Low: <50% relevant, mostly off-topic

SAMPLE FINDINGS: [2-3 actual examples of content found]
  Example: "Motion sensor fails in hallway" (Reddit, 2.3k upvotes)
  
OBSERVED PATTERNS:
  - [What pain points are mentioned]
  - [What workarounds appear]
  - [What outcome language is used]
  - [Any 3M products mentioned]

RECOMMENDATION: [Keep as-is / Refine to: ___ / Remove / Combine with: ___]
```

### PHASE 4: GAP IDENTIFICATION

**Critical Task**: Find keywords ChatGPT MISSED by:

1. **Reverse Engineering Popular Content**
   - Find highly-engaged lighting content on each platform
   - Extract keywords/phrases THEY use that ChatGPT didn't flag
   - Example: If a viral TikTok uses "landlord-friendly lighting," add that

2. **Following the Conversation**
   - What do COMMENTERS say on popular posts?
   - What language do people actually use vs. what we predicted?
   - Example: Do they say "harsh light" or "migraine-inducing fluorescents"?

3. **Workaround Archaeology**
   - What hacks/DIY solutions are people sharing?
   - What products are mentioned as makeshift fixes?
   - Where do Command hooks, tape, or adhesives already appear?

4. **Emotional Job Language**
   - What feelings do people express? (frustrated, exhausted, proud, relieved)
   - What outcomes matter emotionally? ("finally feels like home," "no more fights with roommate about lighting")

5. **Platform-Specific Vernacular**
   - TikTok: "POV," "hack," "DIY fail," specific sounds/trends
   - Reddit: subreddit-specific jargon
   - Pinterest: "dupes," "inspired by," "budget-friendly"
   - X/Twitter: abbreviations, complaint patterns

### PHASE 5: 3M ADJACENCY DEEP DIVE

**Special Focus**: Where are Command hooks, Scotch tape, 3M adhesives, or 3M films ALREADY being used for lighting solutions?

Search specifically for:
- "Command hooks + lighting"
- "3M tape LED strips"
- "removable lighting solutions"
- "renter-friendly lighting"
- "damage-free installation"
- "adhesive light mounting"

Document:
- How people are using these products now
- What's working/not working
- Opportunity for purpose-built solutions

### PHASE 6: COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE

While searching, flag:
- What brands dominate lighting pain point discussions?
- What products are recommended most?
- What solutions get complained about?
- What price points are mentioned?
- What "wish it existed" comments appear?

## OUTPUT FORMAT

### PART A: KEYWORD VALIDATION MATRIX

```
TESTED KEYWORDS: [total count]
HIGH RELEVANCE (keep): [count + list]
MEDIUM RELEVANCE (refine): [count + list with suggested refinements]
LOW RELEVANCE (remove): [count + list]

```

### PART B: MISSED KEYWORDS (GAPS)

```

## SUCCESS METRICS

Your validation is successful if:
1. **Precision**: 85%+ of retrieved content is relevant to lighting pain points/solutions
2. **Coverage**: ChatGPT's keywords capture 80%+ of relevant conversations, with your additions reaching 95%+
3. **Actionability**: Keywords map directly to JTBD framework and 3M product opportunities
4. **Evidence**: Every recommendation backed by actual live examples with engagement data

## CONSTRAINTS

- **No hallucination**: Only report keywords/content you actually found via live search
- **Cite sources**: Include platform, date, engagement metrics for all examples
- **Home focus**: Filter out commercial/industrial/automotive lighting
- **Renter-friendly bias**: Prioritize removable, non-permanent solutions
- **3M lens**: Always flag where 3M products appear or could solve problems

## EXECUTION GUIDANCE

**For Gemini Pro Deep Research**: Use multi-step iterative research. Start broad, refine based on what you find. Follow interesting threads (if Reddit post mentions a workaround, search for that workaround on other platforms).

**For Grok**: Leverage your real-time X/Twitter access for trending pain points and live sentiment. Cross-reference with web search for deeper context.

**Time allocation**: Spend 60% testing ChatGPT's keywords, 40% hunting for gaps.

**BEGIN VALIDATION**: Wait to receive ChatGPT's keyword universe, then execute live testing and gap analysis. Prioritize ACTUAL FINDINGS over comprehensive coverageâ€”better to deeply validate 70% than superficially test 100%.
